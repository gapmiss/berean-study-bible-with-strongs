# Ecclesiastes 4

[[Ecclesiastes 3|←]] • [[Ecclesiastes 5|→]]

###### 1
Again, [[H7725]] I [[H589]] observed [[H7200]] all [[H3605]] the oppression [[H6231]] taking place [[H6213]] under [[H8478]] the sun. [[H8121]] [I] saw [[H2009]] the tears [[H1832]] of the oppressed, [[H6217]] and they had no [[H369]] comforter; [[H5162]] the power [lay] [[H3581]] in the hands [of their oppressors], [[H3027]] and there was no [[H369]] comforter. [[H5162]]

###### 2
So I [[H589]] admired [[H7623]] the dead, [[H4191]] who had already [[H3528]] died, [[H4191]] above [[H4480]] the living, [[H2416]] who [[H834]] are still [[H5728]] alive. [[H2416]]

###### 3
But better [[H2896]] than both [[H8147]] is he who [[H834]] has not [[H3808]] yet [[H5728]] existed, [[H1961]] who [[H834]] has not [[H3808]] seen [[H7200]] the evil [[H7451]] that [[H834]] is done [[H6213]] under [[H8478]] the sun. [[H8121]]

###### 4
I [[H589]] saw [[H7200]] that all [[H3605]] labor [[H5999]] and [[H853]] success [[H3788]] spring from [[H3588]] a man’s [[H376]] envy [[H7068]] of his neighbor. [[H7453]] This [[H2088]] too [[H1571]] is futile [[H1892]] and a pursuit [[H7469]] of the wind. [[H7307]]

###### 5
The fool [[H3684]] folds [[H2263]] his hands [[H3027]] and consumes [[H398]] his own flesh. [[H1320]]

###### 6
Better [[H2896]] one handful [[H4393]] with tranquility [[H5183]] than two handfuls [[H4393]] with toil [[H5999]] and pursuit [[H7469]] of the wind. [[H7307]]

###### 7
Again, [[H7725]] I [[H589]] saw [[H7200]] futility [[H1892]] under [[H8478]] the sun. [[H8121]]

###### 8
There is [[H3426]] a [[H259]] man all alone, [[H369]] without [[H369]] even [[H1571]] a son [[H1121]] or brother. [[H251]] And though there is no [[H369]] end [[H7093]] to his labor, [[H5999]] his eyes [[H5869]] are still [[H1571]] not [[H3808]] content [[H7646]] with his wealth: [[H6239]] “For whom [[H4310]] do I [[H589]] toil [[H6001]] and bereave [[H2637]] my soul [[H5315]] of enjoyment?” [[H2896]] This [[H2088]] too [[H1571]] is futile [[H1892]] a miserable [[H7451]] task. [[H6045]]

###### 9
Two [[H8147]] are better [[H2896]] than [[H4480]] one, [[H259]] because [[H834]] they have [[H3426]] a good [[H2896]] return [[H7939]] for their labor. [[H5999]]

###### 10
For [[H3588]] if [[H518]] one [[H259]] falls down, [[H5307]] his companion [[H2270]] can lift him up; [[H6965]] but pity [[H337]] the one [[H259]] who falls [[H5307]] without [[H369]] another [[H8145]] to help him up! [[H6965]]

###### 11
Again, [[H1571]] if [[H518]] two [[H8147]] lie down together, [[H7901]] they will keep warm; [[H2552]] but how [[H349]] can one [[H259]] keep warm {alone}? [[H3179]]

###### 12
And though [[H518]] one [[H259]] may be overpowered, [[H8630]] two [[H8147]] can resist. [[H5975]] Moreover, a cord [[H2339]] of three [[H8027]] strands is not [[H3808]] quickly [[H4120]] broken. [[H5423]]

###### 13
Better [[H2896]] is a poor [[H4542]] but wise [[H2450]] youth [[H3206]] than an old [[H2205]] but foolish [[H3684]] king [[H4428]] who [[H834]] no [[H3808]] longer [[H5750]] knows [[H3045]] how to take a warning. [[H2094]]

###### 14
For [[H3588]] [the youth] came [[H3318]] from prison [[H1004]] to be king, [[H4427]] even though [[H3588]] he was born [[H3205]] poor [[H7326]] in his kingdom. [[H4438]]

###### 15
I saw that [[H7200]] all [[H3605]] who lived [[H2416]] and walked [[H1980]] under [[H8478]] the sun [[H8121]] followed [[H5973]] this second [[H8145]] child, [[H3206]] who [[H834]] succeeded [[H5975]] [the king]. [[H8478]]

###### 16
There is no [[H369]] limit [[H7093]] to all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] who [[H834]] were [[H1961]] before them, [[H6440]] yet [[H1571]] those who come later [[H314]] will not [[H3808]] rejoice [[H8055]] in [the successor].  This [[H2088]] too [[H3588]] is futile [[H1892]] and a pursuit [[H7475]] of the wind. [[H7307]]
