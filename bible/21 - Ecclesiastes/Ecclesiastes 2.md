# Ecclesiastes 2

[[Ecclesiastes 1|←]] • [[Ecclesiastes 3|→]]

###### 1
I [[H589]] said [[H559]] to myself, [[H3820]] “Come [[H1980]] now, [[H4994]] I will test [[H5254]] you with pleasure; [[H8057]] enjoy [[H7200]] what is good!” [[H2896]] But it [[H1931]] proved [[H2009]] to be futile. [[H1892]]

###### 2
I said [[H559]] of laughter, [[H7814]] “It is folly,” [[H1984]] and of pleasure, [[H8057]] “What [[H4100]] does it [[H2090]] accomplish?” [[H6213]]

###### 3
My mind, [[H3820]] [all the while] [[H3820]] guiding [[H5090]] me with wisdom, [[H2451]] sought [[H8446]] to cheer my body [[H1320]] with wine [[H3196]] and embrace [[H270]] folly, [[H5531]] until [[H5704]] I could see [[H7200]] what [[H335]] [was] [[H2088]] worthwhile [[H2896]] for men [[H1121]] to do [[H6213]] under [[H8478]] heaven [[H8064]] during the few [[H4557]] days [[H3117]] of their lives. [[H2416]]

###### 4
I enlarged [[H1431]] my works. [[H4639]] I built [[H1129]] myself  houses [[H1004]] and planted [[H5193]] myself  vineyards. [[H3754]]

###### 5
I made [[H6213]] myself  gardens [[H1593]] and parks [[H6508]] and planted [[H5193]] in them  all kinds [[H3605]] of fruit [[H6529]] trees. [[H6086]]

###### 6
I built [[H6213]] reservoirs [[H1295]] to water [[H8248]] my groves [[H3293]] of flourishing [[H6779]] trees. [[H6086]]

###### 7
I acquired [[H7069]] menservants [[H5650]] and maidservants, [[H8198]] and servants were born [[H1121]] in my house. [[H1004]] I also [[H1571]] owned [[H1961]] more [[H7235]] herds [[H1241]] and flocks [[H6629]] than anyone [[H3605]] in Jerusalem [[H3389]] before me, [[H6440]]

###### 8
and I [[H1571]] accumulated [[H3664]] for myself  silver [[H3701]] and gold [[H2091]] and the treasure [[H5459]] of kings [[H4428]] and provinces. [[H4082]] I gathered [[H6213]] to myself  male and [[H7891]] female singers, [[H7891]] and the delights [[H8588]] of the sons [[H1121]] of men— [[H120]] many [[H7705]] concubines. [[H7705]]

###### 9
So I became great [[H1431]] and surpassed [[H3254]] all [[H3605]] in Jerusalem [[H3389]] who had preceded me; [[H1961]] and [[H637]] my wisdom [[H2451]] remained with me. [[H5975]]

###### 10
Anything [[H3605]] my eyes [[H5869]] desired, [[H7592]] I did not [[H3808]] deny myself. [[H680]] I refused [[H4513]] my heart [[H3820]] no [[H3808]] pleasure. [[H8057]] For [[H3588]] my heart [[H3820]] took delight [[H8055]] in all [[H3605]] my work, [[H5999]] and this [[H2088]] was [[H1961]] the reward [[H2506]] for all [[H3605]] my labor. [[H5999]]

###### 11
Yet when I [[H589]] considered [[H6437]] all [[H3605]] the works [[H4639]] that my hands [[H3027]] had accomplished [[H6213]] and [what] [[H5999]] I had toiled [[H5998]] to achieve, [[H6213]] I found [[H2009]] everything [[H3605]] to be futile, [[H1892]] a pursuit [[H7469]] of the wind; [[H7307]] there was nothing [[H369]] to be gained [[H3504]] under [[H8478]] the sun. [[H8121]]

###### 12
Then I [[H589]] turned [[H6437]] to consider [[H7200]] wisdom [[H2451]] and madness [[H1947]] and folly; [[H5531]] for [[H3588]] what [more] [[H4100]] can the king’s [[H4428]] successor [[H935]] do [[H834]] than what has already [[H3528]] been accomplished? [[H6213]]

###### 13
And I [[H589]] saw [[H7200]] that [[H3426]] wisdom [[H2451]] exceeds [[H3504]] folly, [[H5531]] just as light [[H216]] exceeds [[H3504]] darkness: [[H2822]]

###### 14
The wise [[H2450]] man has eyes [[H5869]] in his head, [[H7218]] but the fool [[H3684]] walks [[H1980]] in darkness. [[H2822]] Yet I [[H589]] also [[H1571]] came to realize [[H3045]] that one [[H259]] fate [[H4745]] overcomes [[H7136]] them both. [[H3605]]

###### 15
So I [[H589]] said [[H559]] to myself, [[H3820]] “The fate [[H4745]] of the fool [[H3684]] will also [[H1571]] befall me. [[H7136]] What [[H4100]] then [[H227]] have I [[H589]] gained [[H3148]] by being wise?” [[H2449]] And I said [[H1696]] to myself [[H3820]] that this [[H2088]] too [[H1571]] is futile. [[H1892]]

###### 16
For [[H3588]] there is no [[H369]] lasting [[H5769]] remembrance [[H2146]] of the wise, [[H2450]] just as with [[H5973]] the fool, [[H3684]] seeing that [[H3528]] both [[H3605]] will be forgotten [[H7911]] in the days [[H3117]] to come. [[H935]] Alas, [[H349]] the wise man [[H2450]] will die [[H4191]] just like [[H5973]] the fool! [[H3684]]

###### 17
So I hated [[H8130]] life, [[H2416]] because [[H3588]] the work [[H4639]] that is done [[H6213]] under [[H8478]] the sun [[H8121]] was grievous [[H7451]] to me. [[H5921]] For [[H3588]] everything [[H3605]] is futile [[H1892]] and a pursuit [[H7469]] of the wind. [[H7307]]

###### 18
I [[H589]] hated [[H8130]] all [[H3605]] for which [[H589]] I had toiled [[H5999]] under [[H8478]] the sun, [[H8121]] because I must leave it [[H3240]] to the man [[H120]] who comes [[H1961]] after me. [[H310]]

###### 19
And who [[H4310]] knows [[H3045]] whether he will be [[H1961]] a wise [[H2450]] man or [[H176]] a fool? [[H5530]] Yet he will take [[H7980]] over all [[H3605]] the labor [[H5999]] at which I have worked [[H5998]] skillfully [[H2449]] under [[H8478]] the sun. [[H8121]] This [[H2088]] too [[H1571]] is futile. [[H1892]]

###### 20
So [[H589]] my heart [[H3820]] began [[H5437]] to despair [[H2976]] over [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] the labor [[H5999]] that I had done [[H5998]] under [[H8478]] the sun. [[H8121]]

###### 21
When [[H3588]] there is [[H3426]] a man [[H120]] who has labored [[H5999]] with wisdom, [[H2451]] knowledge, [[H1847]] and skill, [[H3788]] and he must give [[H5414]] his portion [[H2506]] to a man [[H120]] who has not [[H3808]] worked for it, [[H5998]] this [[H2088]] too [[H1571]] is futile [[H1892]] and a great [[H7227]] evil. [[H7451]]

###### 22
For [[H3588]] what [[H4100]] does a man [[H120]] get [[H1933]] for all [[H3605]] the labor [[H5999]] and endeavors [[H7475]] at which [[H1931]] he toils [[H6001]] under [[H8478]] the sun? [[H8121]]

###### 23
Indeed, [[H3588]] all [[H3605]] his days [[H3117]] are filled with grief, [[H4341]] and his task [[H6045]] is sorrowful; [[H3708]] even [[H1571]] at night, [[H3915]] his mind [[H3820]] does not [[H3808]] rest. [[H7901]] This [[H2088]] too [[H1571]] is futile. [[H1892]]

###### 24
Nothing [[H369]] [is] better [[H2896]] for man [[H120]] than to eat [[H398]] and drink [[H8354]] and [[H3318]] enjoy [[H7200]] his work. [[H5999]] I [[H589]] have also [[H1571]] seen [[H1931]] that [[H3588]] this [is] [[H2090]] from the hand [[H3027]] of God. [[H430]]

###### 25
For [[H3588]] apart from [[H2351]] Him, [[H4480]] who [[H4310]] can eat [[H398]] and who [[H4310]] can find enjoyment? [[H2363]]

###### 26
To [[H3588]] the man [[H120]] who is pleasing [[H2896]] in His sight, [[H6440]] He gives [[H5414]] wisdom [[H2451]] and knowledge [[H1847]] and joy, [[H8057]] but to the sinner [[H2398]] He assigns [[H5414]] the task [[H6045]] of gathering [[H622]] and accumulating [that which] [[H3664]] he will hand over [[H5414]] to one who pleases [[H2896]] God. [[H430]] This [[H2088]] too [[H1571]] is futile [[H1892]] and a pursuit [[H7469]] of the wind. [[H7307]]
