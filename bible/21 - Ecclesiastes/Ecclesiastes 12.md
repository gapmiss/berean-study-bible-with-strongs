# Ecclesiastes 12

[[Ecclesiastes 11|←]] • [[Song of Solomon 1|→]]

---

###### 1
Remember [[H2142]] your Creator [[H1254]] in the days [[H3117]] of your youth, [[H979]] before [[H5704]] the days [[H3117]] of adversity [[H7451]] come, [[H935]] and the years [[H8141]] approach [[H5060]] of which [[H834]] you will say, [[H559]] “I find no [[H369]] pleasure in them,” [[H2656]]

###### 2
before [[H5704]] the sunlight, [[H8121]] moon, [[H3394]] and stars [[H3556]] are darkened, [[H2821]] and the clouds [[H5645]] return [[H7725]] after [[H310]] the rain, [[H1653]]

###### 3
on the day [[H3117]] the keepers [[H8104]] of the house [[H1004]] tremble, [[H2111]] and the strong [[H2428]] men [[H376]] stoop, [[H5791]] when those grinding [[H2912]] cease [[H988]] because [[H3588]] they are few, [[H4592]] and those watching [[H7200]] through windows [[H699]] see dimly, [[H2821]]

###### 4
when the doors [[H1817]] to the street [[H7784]] are shut [[H5462]] and the sound [[H6963]] of the mill [[H2913]] fades away, [[H8217]] when one rises [[H6965]] at the sound [[H6963]] of a bird, [[H6833]] and all [[H3605]] the daughters [[H1323]] of song [[H7892]] grow faint, [[H7817]]

###### 5
[when] [[H1571]] [men] fear [[H3372]] the heights [[H1364]] and dangers [[H2849]] of the road, [[H1870]] when the almond tree [[H8247]] blossoms, [[H5006]] the grasshopper [[H2284]] loses its spring, [[H5445]] and the caper berry [[H35]] shrivels— [[H6565]] for then [[H3588]] man [[H120]] goes [[H1980]] to [[H413]] his eternal [[H5769]] home, [[H1004]] and mourners [[H5594]] walk [[H5437]] the streets. [[H7784]]

###### 6
[Remember Him] before [[H5704]] the silver [[H3701]] cord [[H2256]] is snapped, [[H7368]] and the golden [[H2091]] bowl [[H1543]] is crushed, [[H7533]] [before] the pitcher [[H3537]] is shattered [[H7665]] at [[H5921]] the spring, [[H4002]] and the wheel [[H1534]] is broken [[H7533]] at [[H413]] the well, [[H953]]

###### 7
[before] the dust [[H6083]] returns [[H7725]] to [[H5921]] the ground [[H776]] from which it came, [[H1961]] and the spirit [[H7307]] returns [[H7725]] to [[H413]] God [[H430]] who [[H834]] gave it. [[H5414]]

###### 8
“Futility [[H1892]] of futilities,” [[H1892]] says [[H559]] the Teacher. [[H6953]] “Everything [[H3605]] is futile!” [[H1892]]

###### 9
Not only [[H3148]] was [[H1961]] the Teacher [[H6953]] wise, [[H2450]] but he also [[H5750]] taught [[H3925]] the people [[H5971]] knowledge; [[H1847]] he pondered, [[H238]] searched out, [[H2713]] and arranged [[H8626]] many [[H7235]] proverbs. [[H4912]]

###### 10
The Teacher [[H6953]] searched [[H1245]] to find [[H4672]] delightful [[H2656]] sayings [[H1697]] and to record [[H3789]] accurate [[H3476]] words [[H1697]] of truth. [[H571]]

###### 11
The words [[H1697]] of the wise [[H2450]] are like goads, [[H1861]] and the anthologies [[H627]] of the masters [[H1167]] are like firmly embedded [[H5193]] nails [[H4930]] driven [[H5414]] by a single [[H259]] Shepherd. [[H7462]]

###### 12
But beyond [[H3148]] these, [[H1992]] my son, [[H1121]] be warned: [[H2094]] There is no [[H369]] end [[H7093]] to the making [[H6213]] of many [[H7235]] books, [[H5612]] and much [[H7235]] study [[H3854]] wearies [[H3024]] the body. [[H1320]]

###### 13
When all [[H3605]] has been heard, [[H8085]] the conclusion [[H5490]] of the matter [is this]: [[H1697]] Fear [[H3372]] God [[H430]] and [[H853]] keep [[H8104]] His commandments, [[H4687]] because [[H3588]] this is [[H2088]] the whole [[H3605]] [duty] of man. [[H120]]

###### 14
For [[H3588]] God [[H430]] will bring [[H935]] every [[H3605]] deed [[H4639]] into judgment, [[H4941]] along with [[H5921]] every hidden [[H5956]] thing, [[H3605]] whether [[H518]] good [[H2896]] or [[H518]] evil. [[H7451]]
