# Ecclesiastes 8

[[Ecclesiastes 7|←]] • [[Ecclesiastes 9|→]]

---

### 1
Who [[H4310]] is like the wise man? [[H2450]] Who [[H4310]] knows [[H3045]] the interpretation [[H6592]] of a matter? [[H1697]] A man’s [[H120]] wisdom [[H2451]] brightens [[H215]] his face, [[H6440]] and the sternness [[H5797]] of his face [[H6440]] is changed. [[H8132]]

### 2
Keep [[H8104]] the king’s [[H4428]] command, [[H6310]] I say, [[H589]] because of [[H5921]] your oath [[H7621]] before God. [[H430]]

### 3
Do not [[H408]] hasten [[H926]] to leave [[H1980]] his presence, [[H6440]] and do not [[H408]] persist [[H5975]] in a bad [[H7451]] cause, [[H1697]] for [[H3588]] he will do [[H6213]] whatever [[H3605]] he wants. [[H2654]]

### 4
For [[H834]] the king’s [[H4428]] word [[H1697]] is supreme, [[H7983]] and who [[H4310]] can say [[H559]] to him,  “What [[H4100]] are you doing?” [[H6213]]

### 5
Whoever keeps [[H8104]] his command [[H4687]] will come to [[H3045]] no [[H3808]] harm, [[H7451]] and a wise [[H2450]] heart [[H3820]] knows [[H3045]] the right time [[H6256]] and procedure. [[H4941]]

### 6
For [[H3588]] there is [[H3426]] a right time [[H6256]] and procedure [[H4941]] to every [[H3605]] purpose, [[H2656]] though [[H3588]] a man’s [[H120]] misery [[H7451]] weighs heavily [[H7227]] upon him. [[H5921]]

### 7
Since [[H3588]] no one [[H369]] knows [[H3045]] what [[H4100]] will happen, [[H1961]] who [[H4310]] can tell [[H5046]] him  what [[H834]] is to come? [[H1961]]

### 8
As no [[H369]] man [[H120]] has power [[H7989]] over the wind [[H7307]] to contain [[H3607]] [it], [[H7307]] so there is no [[H369]] authority [[H7983]] over the day [[H3117]] of death. [[H4194]] As no one [[H369]] can be discharged [[H4917]] in wartime, [[H4421]] so wickedness [[H7562]] will not [[H3808]] release [[H4422]] those who practice it. [[H1167]]

### 9
All [[H3605]] this [[H2088]] I have seen, [[H7200]] applying [[H5414]] my mind [[H3820]] to every [[H3605]] deed [[H4639]] that [[H834]] is done [[H6213]] under [[H8478]] the sun; [[H8121]] [there is] a time [[H6256]] when [[H834]] one man [[H120]] lords it [[H7980]] over another [[H120]] to his own detriment. [[H7451]]

### 10
Then too, [[H3651]] I saw [[H7200]] the burial [[H6912]] of the wicked [[H7563]] who had come [[H935]] and gone [[H1980]] from the holy [[H6918]] place [[H4725]] and were praised [[H7911]] in the city [[H5892]] where [[H834]] they had done [[H6213]] so. [[H3651]] This [[H2088]] too [[H1571]] is futile. [[H1892]]

### 11
When [[H834]] the sentence [[H6599]] for a crime [[H7451]] is not [[H369]] speedily [[H4120]] executed, [[H6213]] the hearts [[H3820]] of men [[H120]] become fully set [[H4390]] on doing [[H6213]] evil. [[H7451]]

### 12
Although [[H834]] a sinner [[H2398]] does [[H6213]] evil [[H7451]] a hundred [times] [[H3967]] and still lives long, [[H748]] yet [[H3588]] I [[H589]] also [[H1571]] know [[H3045]] that [[H834]] it will go [[H1961]] well [[H2896]] with those who [[H834]] fear [[H3372]] God, [[H430]] who are reverent [[H3372]] in His presence. [[H6440]]

### 13
Yet because [[H834]] [the wicked] do not [[H369]] fear [[H3373]] God, [[H430]] it will not [[H3808]] go [[H1961]] well [[H2896]] with [them], [[H7563]] and their days [[H3117]] will not [[H3808]] lengthen [[H748]] like a shadow. [[H6738]]

### 14
There is [[H3426]] a futility [[H1892]] that [[H834]] is done [[H6213]] on [[H5921]] the earth: [[H776]] There are [[H3426]] righteous [men] [[H6662]] who [[H834]] get [[H5060]] what the actions [[H4639]] of the wicked [deserve], [[H7563]] and there are [[H3426]] wicked [men] [[H7563]] who [[H413]] get [[H5060]] what the actions [[H4639]] of the righteous deserve. [[H6662]] I say [[H559]] that this [[H2088]] too [[H1571]] is futile. [[H1892]]

### 15
So I [[H589]] commended [[H7623]] the enjoyment of life, [[H8057]] because [[H834]] there is nothing [[H369]] better [[H2896]] for a man [[H120]] under [[H8478]] the sun [[H8121]] than [[H3588]] to eat [[H398]] and drink [[H8354]] and be merry. [[H8055]] For this [joy] [[H1931]] will accompany [[H3867]] him in his labor [[H5999]] during the days [[H3117]] of his life [[H2416]] that [[H834]] God [[H430]] gives [[H5414]] him under [[H8478]] the sun. [[H8121]]

### 16
When [[H834]] I applied [[H5414]] my mind [[H3820]] to know [[H3045]] wisdom [[H2451]] and to observe [[H7200]] the activity [[H6045]] that [[H834]] one does [[H6213]] on [[H5921]] the earth— [[H776]] though [[H3588]] his eyes [[H5869]] do not [[H369]] see [[H7200]] sleep [[H8142]] day [[H3117]] or night— [[H3915]]

### 17
I saw [[H7200]] every [[H3605]] work [[H4639]] of God, [[H430]] and that [[H3588]] a man [[H120]] is unable [[H3808]] to comprehend [[H4672]] the work [[H4639]] that [[H834]] is done [[H6213]] under [[H8478]] the sun. [[H8121]] Despite [[H7945]] [his] [[H120]] efforts [[H5998]] to search it out, [[H1245]] he cannot [[H3808]] find [its meaning]; [[H4672]] even [[H1571]] if [[H518]] the wise [[H2450]] man claims [[H559]] to know, [[H3045]] he is unable [[H3808]] to comprehend. [[H4672]]
