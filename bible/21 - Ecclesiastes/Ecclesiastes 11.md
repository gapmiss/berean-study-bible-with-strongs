# Ecclesiastes 11

[[Ecclesiastes 10|←]] • [[Ecclesiastes 12|→]]

---

###### 1
Cast [[H7971]] your bread [[H3899]] upon [[H5921]] the waters, [[H4325]] for [[H3588]] after many [[H7230]] days [[H3117]] you will find it [again]. [[H4672]]

###### 2
Divide [[H5414]] your portion [[H2506]] among seven, [[H7651]] or even [[H1571]] eight, [[H8083]] for [[H3588]] you do not [[H3808]] know [[H3045]] what [[H4100]] disaster [[H7451]] may befall [[H1961]] the land. [[H776]]

###### 3
If [[H518]] the clouds [[H5645]] are full, [[H4390]] they will pour out [[H7324]] rain [[H1653]] upon [[H5921]] the earth; [[H776]] whether [[H518]] a tree [[H6086]] falls [[H5307]] to the south [[H1864]] or [[H518]] the north, [[H6828]] in the place [[H4725]] where [it] [[H6086]] falls, [[H5307]] there [[H8033]] it will lie. [[H1933]]

###### 4
He who watches [[H8104]] the wind [[H7307]] will fail [[H3808]] to sow, [[H2232]] and he who observes [[H7200]] the clouds [[H5645]] will fail [[H3808]] to reap. [[H7114]]

###### 5
As [[H834]] you do not [[H369]] know [[H3045]] the path [[H1870]] of the wind, [[H7307]] or how the bones [are formed] [[H6106]] in a mother’s [[H4392]] womb, [[H990]] so [[H3602]] you cannot [[H3808]] understand [[H3045]] the work [[H4639]] of God, [[H430]] the Maker [[H6213]] of all things. [[H3605]]

###### 6
Sow [[H2232]] your seed [[H2233]] in the morning, [[H1242]] and do not [[H408]] rest [[H3240]] your hands [[H3027]] in the evening, [[H6153]] for [[H3588]] you do not [[H369]] know [[H3045]] which [[H335]] will succeed, [[H3787]] whether this [[H2088]] or [[H176]] that, [[H2088]] or if [[H518]] both [[H8147]] will equally [[H259]] prosper. [[H2896]]

###### 7
Light [[H216]] is sweet, [[H4966]] and it pleases [[H2896]] the eyes [[H5869]] to see [[H7200]] the sun. [[H8121]]

###### 8
So [[H3588]] if [[H518]] a man [[H120]] lives [[H2421]] many [[H7235]] years, [[H8141]] let him rejoice [[H8055]] in them all; [[H3605]] but let him remember [[H2142]] the days [[H3117]] of darkness, [[H2822]] for [[H3588]] they will be [[H1961]] many. [[H7235]] Everything [[H3605]] to come [[H935]] is futile. [[H1892]]

###### 9
Rejoice, [[H8055]] O young man, [[H970]] while you are young, [[H3208]] and let your heart [[H3820]] be glad [[H3190]] in the days [[H3117]] of your youth. [[H979]] Walk [[H1980]] in the ways [[H1870]] of your heart [[H3820]] and in the sight [[H4758]] of your eyes, [[H5869]] but know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] for [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] these [things] [[H428]] God [[H430]] will bring you [[H935]] to judgment. [[H4941]]

###### 10
So banish [[H5493]] sorrow [[H3708]] from your heart, [[H3820]] and cast off [[H5674]] pain [[H7451]] from your body, [[H1320]] for [[H3588]] youth [[H3208]] and vigor [[H7839]] are fleeting. [[H1892]]
