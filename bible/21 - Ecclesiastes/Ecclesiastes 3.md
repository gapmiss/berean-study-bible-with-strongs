# Ecclesiastes 3

[[Ecclesiastes 2|←]] • [[Ecclesiastes 4|→]]

---

### 1
To everything [[H3605]] there is a season, [[H2165]] and a time [[H6256]] for every [[H3605]] purpose [[H2656]] under [[H8478]] heaven: [[H8064]]

### 2
a time [[H6256]] to be born [[H3205]] and a time [[H6256]] to die, [[H4191]] a time [[H6256]] to plant [[H5193]] and a time [[H6256]] to uproot, [[H6131]]

### 3
a time [[H6256]] to kill [[H2026]] and a time [[H6256]] to heal, [[H7495]] a time [[H6256]] to break down [[H6555]] and a time [[H6256]] to build, [[H1129]]

### 4
a time [[H6256]] to weep [[H1058]] and a time [[H6256]] to laugh, [[H7832]] a time [[H6256]] to mourn [[H5594]] and a time [[H6256]] to dance, [[H7540]]

### 5
a time [[H6256]] to cast away [[H7993]] stones [[H68]] and a time [[H6256]] to gather [[H3664]] stones [together], [[H68]] a time [[H6256]] to embrace [[H2263]] and a time [[H6256]] to refrain [[H7368]] from embracing, [[H2263]]

### 6
a time [[H6256]] to search [[H1245]] and a time [[H6256]] to count as lost, [[H6]] a time [[H6256]] to keep [[H8104]] and a time [[H6256]] to discard, [[H7993]]

### 7
a time [[H6256]] to tear [[H7167]] and a time [[H6256]] to mend, [[H8609]] a time [[H6256]] to be silent [[H2814]] and a time [[H6256]] to speak, [[H1696]]

### 8
a time [[H6256]] to love [[H157]] and a time [[H6256]] to hate, [[H8130]] a time [[H6256]] for war [[H4421]] and a time [[H6256]] for peace. [[H7965]]

### 9
What [[H4100]] does the worker [[H6213]] gain [[H3504]] from his [[H1931]] toil? [[H6001]]

### 10
I have seen [[H7200]] the burden [[H6045]] that [[H834]] God [[H430]] has laid [[H5414]] on men [[H1121]] to occupy them. [[H6031]]

### 11
He has made [[H6213]] everything [[H3605]] beautiful [[H3303]] in its time. [[H6256]] He has also [[H1571]] set [[H5414]] eternity [[H5769]] in the hearts [of men], [[H3820]] yet [[H1097]] [they] [[H120]] cannot [[H3808]] fathom [[H4672]] the work [[H4639]] God [[H430]] has done [[H6213]] from beginning [[H7218]] to [[H5704]] end. [[H5490]]

### 12
I know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] there is nothing [[H369]] better [[H2896]] for [men] than [[H3588]] to rejoice [[H8055]] and do [[H6213]] good [[H2896]] while they live, [[H2416]]

### 13
and also [[H1571]] that every [[H3605]] man [[H120]] should eat [[H398]] and drink [[H8354]] and find [[H7200]] satisfaction [[H2896]] in all [[H3605]] his labor— [[H5999]] this is [[H1931]] the gift [[H4991]] of God. [[H430]]

### 14
I know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] everything [[H3605]] God [[H430]] does [[H6213]] will remain forever; [[H1961]] nothing [[H369]] can be added [[H3254]] to it [[H5921]] or taken [[H1639]] from it. [[H4480]] God [[H430]] works [[H6213]] that men should revere [[H3372]] Him. [[H6440]]

### 15
What exists [[H4100]] has already [[H3528]] been, [[H1961]] and what [[H834]] will be [[H1961]] has already [[H3528]] been, [[H1961]] for God [[H430]] will call to account [[H1245]] what has passed. [[H7291]]

### 16
Furthermore, [[H5750]] I saw [[H7200]] under [[H8478]] the sun [[H8121]] that in the place [[H4725]] of judgment [[H4941]] there is [[H8033]] wickedness, [[H7562]] and in the place [[H4725]] of righteousness [[H6664]] there is [[H8033]] wickedness. [[H7562]]

### 17
I [[H589]] said [[H559]] in my heart, [[H3820]] “God [[H430]] will judge [[H8199]] the righteous [[H6662]] and [[H853]] the wicked, [[H7563]] since [[H3588]] there is a time [[H6256]] for every [[H3605]] activity [[H2656]] and every [[H3605]] deed.” [[H4639]]

### 18
I [[H589]] said [[H559]] to myself, [[H3820]] “As for [[H5921]] the sons [[H1121]] of men, [[H120]] God [[H430]] tests them [[H1305]] so that they may see [[H7200]] for themselves [[H1992]] that they [[H1992]] are but beasts.” [[H929]]

### 19
For [[H3588]] the fates [[H4745]] of [both] men [[H120]] [and] [[H4745]] beasts [[H929]] are the same: [[H259]] As one [[H2088]] dies, [[H4194]] so [[H3651]] dies [[H4194]] the other— [[H2088]] they all [[H3605]] have the same [[H259]] breath. [[H7307]] Man [[H120]] has no [[H369]] advantage [[H4195]] over [[H4480]] the animals, [[H929]] since [[H3588]] everything [[H3605]] is futile. [[H1892]]

### 20
All [[H3605]] go [[H1980]] to [[H413]] one [[H259]] place: [[H4725]] All [[H3605]] come [[H1961]] from [[H4480]] dust, [[H6083]] and all [[H3605]] return [[H7725]] to [[H413]] dust. [[H6083]]

### 21
Who [[H4310]] knows [[H3045]] if the spirit [[H7307]] of man [[H1121]] rises [[H5927]] upward [[H4605]] and the spirit [[H7307]] of the animal [[H929]] descends [[H3381]] into the earth? [[H776]]

### 22
I have seen [[H7200]] that [[H3588]] there is nothing [[H369]] better [[H2896]] for a man [[H120]] than [[H834]] to enjoy [[H8055]] his work, [[H4639]] because [[H3588]] that [[H1931]] is his lot. [[H2506]] For [[H3588]] who [[H4310]] can bring [[H935]] him to see [[H7200]] what [[H4100]] will come [[H1961]] after him? [[H310]]
