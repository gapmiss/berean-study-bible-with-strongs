# Ecclesiastes 9

[[Ecclesiastes 8|←]] • [[Ecclesiastes 10|→]]

---

### 1
So [[H3588]] I took [[H5414]] all [[H3605]] this [[H2088]] to [[H413]] heart [[H3820]] and concluded [[H952]] that [[H834]] the righteous [[H6662]] and the wise, [[H2450]] as well as their deeds, [[H5652]] are in God’s [[H430]] hands. [[H3027]] Man [[H120]] does not [[H369]] know [[H3045]] what [[H3605]] lies ahead, [[H6440]] whether [[H1571]] love [[H160]] or [[H1571]] hate. [[H8135]]

### 2
It is the same [[H834]] for all: [[H3605]] There is a common [[H259]] fate [[H4745]] for the righteous [[H6662]] and the wicked, [[H7563]] for the good [and the bad], [[H2896]] for the clean [[H2889]] and the unclean, [[H2931]] for the one who sacrifices [[H2076]] and the one [[H834]] who does not. [[H369]] As it is for the good, [[H2896]] so it is for the sinner; [[H2398]] as it is for the one who makes a vow, [[H7650]] so [it is] [[H834]] for the one who refuses [[H3372]] to take a vow. [[H7621]]

### 3
This [[H2088]] is an evil [[H7451]] in everything [[H3605]] that [[H834]] is done [[H6213]] under [[H8478]] the sun: [[H8121]] There is one [[H259]] fate [[H4745]] for everyone. [[H3605]] Furthermore, [[H1571]] the hearts [[H3820]] of men [[H1121]] are full of [[H4390]] evil [[H7451]] and madness [[H1947]] while they are alive, [[H2416]] and afterward [[H310]] they [join] [[H413]] the dead. [[H4191]]

### 4
There is [[H3426]] hope, [[H986]] however, [[H3588]] for anyone who [[H4310]] is among [[H977]] the living; [[H2416]] for even [[H3588]] a live [[H2416]] dog [[H3611]] is better [[H2896]] than [[H4480]] a dead [[H4191]] lion. [[H738]]

### 5
For [[H3588]] the living [[H2416]] know [[H3045]] that they will die, [[H4191]] but the dead [[H4191]] know [[H3045]] nothing. [[H3972]] They have no [[H369]] further [[H5750]] reward, [[H7939]] because [[H3588]] the memory [[H2143]] of them is forgotten. [[H7911]]

### 6
Their love, [[H160]] their hate, [[H8135]] and [[H1571]] their envy [[H7068]] have already [[H3528]] vanished, [[H6]] and they will never again have [[H369]] a portion [[H2506]] in all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] is done [[H6213]] under [[H8478]] the sun. [[H8121]]

### 7
Go, [[H1980]] eat [[H398]] your bread [[H3899]] with joy, [[H8057]] and drink [[H8354]] your wine [[H3196]] with a cheerful [[H2896]] heart, [[H3820]] for [[H3588]] God [[H430]] has already [[H3528]] approved [[H7521]] your works: [[H4639]]

### 8
“Let your clothes [[H899]] always [[H3605]] be [[H1961]] white, [[H3836]] and never [[H408]] spare [[H2637]] the oil [[H8081]] for [[H5921]] your head.” [[H7218]]

### 9
Enjoy [[H7200]] life [[H2416]] with [[H5973]] your beloved [[H157]] wife [[H802]] all [[H3605]] the days [[H3117]] of the fleeting [[H1892]] life [[H2416]] which [[H834]] has been given [[H5414]] to you under [[H8478]] the sun— [[H8121]] all [[H3605]] your fleeting [[H1892]] days. [[H3117]] For [[H3588]] this [[H1931]] is your portion [[H2506]] in life [[H2416]] and in your labor [[H5999]] under [[H8478]] the sun. [[H8121]]

### 10
Whatever [[H3605]] you find [[H4672]] to do [[H6213]] with your hands, [[H3027]] do [it] [[H6213]] with all your might, [[H3581]] for [[H3588]] in Sheol, [[H7585]] where [[H834]] you [[H859]] are going, [[H1980]] there is no [[H369]] work [[H4639]] or planning [[H2808]] or knowledge [[H1847]] or wisdom. [[H2451]]

### 11
I saw [[H7200]] something else [[H7725]] under [[H8478]] the sun: [[H8121]] The race [[H4793]] is not [[H3808]] to the swift, [[H7031]] nor the battle [[H4421]] to the strong; [[H1368]] neither [is] [[H3808]] the bread [[H3899]] to the wise, [[H2450]] nor [[H1571]] the wealth [[H6239]] to the intelligent, [[H995]] nor [[H1571]] the favor [[H2580]] to the skillful; [[H3045]] rather, [[H3588]] time [[H6256]] and chance [[H6294]] happen [[H7136]] to all. [[H3605]]

### 12
For [[H3588]] surely [[H1571]] no [[H3808]] man [[H120]] knows [[H3045]] his time: [[H6256]] Like fish [[H1709]] caught [[H270]] in a cruel [[H7451]] net [[H4686]] or birds [[H6833]] trapped [[H270]] in a snare, [[H6341]] so men [[H1121]] are ensnared [[H3369]] in an evil [[H7451]] time [[H6256]] that suddenly [[H6597]] falls [[H5307]] upon them. [[H5921]]

### 13
I have also seen [[H7200]] this [[H2090]] wisdom [[H2451]] under [[H8478]] the sun, [[H8121]] and it [[H1931]] [was] great [[H1419]] to me: [[H413]]

### 14
There was a small [[H6996]] city [[H5892]] with few men. [[H4592]] A mighty [[H1419]] king [[H4428]] came [[H935]] against it, [[H413]] surrounded it, [[H5437]] and built [[H1129]] large [[H1419]] siege ramps [[H4685]] against it. [[H5921]]

### 15
Now a poor [[H4542]] wise [[H2450]] man [[H376]] was found [[H4672]] in [the city],  and he [[H1931]] saved [[H4422]] the city [[H5892]] by his wisdom. [[H2451]] Yet no [[H3808]] one [[H120]] remembered [[H2142]] that [[H1931]] poor [[H4542]] man. [[H376]]

### 16
And I [[H589]] said, [[H559]] “Wisdom [[H2451]] is better [[H2896]] than strength, [[H1369]] but the wisdom [[H2451]] of the poor [[H4542]] man is despised, [[H959]] and his words [[H1697]] are not [[H369]] heeded.” [[H8085]]

### 17
The calm [[H5183]] words [[H1697]] of the wise [[H2450]] are heeded [[H8085]] over the shouts [[H2201]] of a ruler [[H4910]] among fools. [[H3684]]

### 18
Wisdom [[H2451]] is better [[H2896]] than weapons [[H3627]] of war, [[H7128]] but one [[H259]] sinner [[H2398]] destroys [[H6]] much [[H7235]] good. [[H2896]]
