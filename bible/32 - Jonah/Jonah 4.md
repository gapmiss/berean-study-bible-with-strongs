###### 1
Jonah, however, [[H3124]] was greatly [[H1419]] displeased, [[H7489]] and became angry. [[H2734]]

###### 2
So he prayed [[H6419]] to [[H413]] the LORD, [[H3069]] saying, [[H559]] “O [[H577]] LORD, [[H3069]] is this [[H2088]] not [[H3808]] what I said [[H1697]] while [[H5704]] I was [[H1961]] still in [[H5921]] my own country? [[H127]] This is why [[H5921]] I was so quick [[H6923]] to flee [[H1272]] toward Tarshish. [[H8659]] I knew [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] You [are] [[H859]] a gracious [[H2587]] and compassionate [[H7349]] God, [[H410]] slow [[H750]] to anger, [[H639]] abounding [[H7227]] in loving devotion [[H2617]] One who relents [[H5162]] from [[H5921]] sending disaster. [[H7451]]

###### 3
And now, [[H6258]] O LORD, [[H3068]] please [[H4994]] take [[H3947]] my life [[H5315]] from me, [[H4480]] for [[H3588]] it is better [[H2896]] for me to die [[H4194]] than to live.” [[H2416]]

###### 4
But the LORD [[H3068]] replied, [[H559]] “Have you  any right [[H3190]] to be angry?” [[H2734]]

###### 5
Then Jonah [[H3124]] left [[H3318]] the city [[H5892]] and sat down [[H3427]] east [[H4480]] of it, [[H6924]] [where] [[H8033]] he made [[H6213]] himself a shelter [[H5521]] and sat [[H3427]] in its shade [[H6738]] to [[H5704]] see [[H7200]] what [[H4100]] would happen [[H1961]] to the city. [[H5892]]

###### 6
So the LORD [[H3068]] God [[H430]] appointed [[H4487]] a vine, [[H7021]] and it grew up [[H5927]] to provide [[H1961]] shade [[H6738]] over [[H5921]] Jonah’s [[H3124]] head [[H7218]] to ease [[H5337]] his  discomfort, [[H7451]] and Jonah [[H3124]] was greatly [[H1419]] pleased [[H8055]] with [[H5921]] the plant. [[H7021]]

###### 7
When dawn [[H7837]] came [[H5927]] the next day, [[H4283]] God [[H430]] appointed [[H4487]] a worm [[H8438]] that attacked [[H5221]] the plant [[H7021]] so that it withered. [[H3001]]

###### 8
As the sun [[H8121]] was rising, [[H2224]] God [[H430]] appointed [[H4487]] a scorching [[H2759]] east [[H6921]] wind, [[H7307]] and the sun [[H8121]] beat down [[H5221]] on [[H5921]] Jonah’s [[H3124]] head [[H7218]] so that he grew faint [[H5968]] and wished [[H7592]] to die, [[H4191]] saying, [[H559]] “It is better [[H2896]] for me to die [[H4191]] than to live.” [[H2416]]

###### 9
Then God [[H430]] asked [[H559]] Jonah, [[H3124]] “Have you  any right [[H3190]] to be angry [[H2734]] about [[H5921]] the plant?” [[H7021]] “I do,” [[H3190]] he replied. [[H559]] “I am angry [[H2734]] enough to [[H5704]] die!” [[H4194]]

###### 10
But the LORD [[H3068]] said, [[H559]] “You [[H859]] cared [[H2347]] about [[H5921]] the plant, [[H7021]] which [[H834]] you neither [[H3808]] tended [[H5998]] nor [[H3808]] made grow. [[H1431]] It sprang up [[H1961]] in a night [[H1121]] and perished [[H6]] in a night. [[H1121]]

###### 11
So should I [[H589]] not [[H3808]] care [[H2347]] about [[H5921]] the great [[H1419]] city [[H5892]] of Nineveh, [[H5210]] which [[H834]] has [[H3426]] more than [[H7235]] 120,000 [[H8147]] people [[H120]] who [[H834]] cannot [[H3808]] tell [[H3045]] their right hand [[H3225]] from their left, [[H8040]] and many [[H7227]] cattle as well?” [[H929]]
