###### 1
Now the word [[H1697]] of the LORD [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] to [[H413]] Jonah [[H3124]] son [[H1121]] of Amittai, [[H573]] saying, [[H559]]

###### 2
“Arise! [[H6965]] Go [[H1980]] to [[H413]] the great [[H1419]] city [[H5892]] of Nineveh [[H5210]] and preach [[H7121]] against it, [[H5921]] because [[H3588]] its wickedness [[H7451]] has come up [[H5927]] before Me.” [[H6440]]

###### 3
Jonah, however, [[H3124]] got up [[H6965]] and fled [[H1272]] to Tarshish, [[H8659]] away from the presence [[H6440]] of the LORD. [[H3068]] He went down [[H3381]] to Joppa [[H3305]] and found [[H4672]] a ship [[H591]] bound [[H935]] for Tarshish. [[H8659]] So he paid [[H5414]] the fare [[H7939]] and went aboard [[H3381]] to sail [[H935]] for Tarshish, [[H8659]] away from the presence [[H6440]] of the LORD. [[H3068]]

###### 4
Then the LORD [[H3068]] hurled [[H2904]] a violent [[H1419]] wind [[H7307]] upon [[H413]] the sea, [[H3220]] and such a violent [[H1419]] storm [[H5591]] arose [[H1961]] that the ship [[H591]] was in danger [[H2803]] of breaking apart. [[H7665]]

###### 5
The sailors [[H4419]] were afraid, [[H3372]] and each [[H376]] cried out [[H2199]] to [[H413]] his own god. [[H430]] And they threw [[H2904]] the ship’s [[H591]] cargo [[H3627]] into [[H413]] the sea [[H3220]] to lighten [[H7043]] the load. [[H5921]] But Jonah [[H3124]] had gone down [[H3381]] to [[H413]] the lowest part [[H3411]] of the vessel, [[H5600]] where he lay down [[H7901]] and fell into a deep sleep. [[H7290]]

###### 6
The captain [[H7227]] approached [[H7126]] him and said, [[H559]] “How [[H4100]] can you  sleep? [[H7290]] Get up [[H6965]] [and] call [[H7121]] upon [[H413]] your God. [[H430]] Perhaps [[H194]] this God [[H430]] will consider us, [[H6245]] so that [[H3808]] we may not perish.” [[H6]]

###### 7
“Come!” [[H1980]] said the sailors [[H559]] to [[H413]] one another. [[H7453]] “Let us cast [[H5307]] lots [[H1486]] to find out [[H3045]] who is responsible [[H7945]] for this [[H2063]] calamity [[H7451]] that is upon us.”  So they cast [[H5307]] lots, [[H1486]] and the lot [[H1486]] fell [[H5307]] on [[H5921]] Jonah. [[H3124]]

###### 8
“Tell [[H5046]] us  now,” [[H4994]] they demanded, [[H559]] “who [[H4310]] is to blame [[H834]] for this [[H2063]] calamity [[H7451]] that is upon us?  What [is] [[H4100]] your occupation, [[H4399]] and from where [[H370]] have you come? [[H935]] What [[H4100]] is your country, [[H776]] and who [[H335]] are your [[H859]] people?” [[H5971]]

###### 9
“I am [[H595]] a Hebrew,” [[H5680]] replied Jonah. [[H559]] “I [[H589]] worship [[H3373]] the LORD, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of the heavens, [[H8064]] who [[H834]] made [[H6213]] the sea [[H3220]] and the dry land.” [[H3004]]

###### 10
Then the men [[H582]] were even more [[H1419]] afraid [[H3372]] and said [[H559]] to him, [[H413]] “What [[H4100]] have you done?” [[H6213]] The men [[H582]] knew [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] he [[H1931]] was fleeing [[H1272]] from the presence [[H6440]] of the LORD, [[H3069]] because [[H3588]] he had told [[H5046]] them. [[H1992]]

###### 11
Now [[H3588]] the sea [[H3220]] was growing worse [[H1980]] and worse, [[H5590]] so they said [[H559]] to [Jonah], [[H413]] “What [[H4100]] must we do [[H6213]] to you  to calm [[H8367]] this sea [[H3220]] for us?” [[H5921]]

###### 12
“Pick me up,” [[H5375]] he answered, [[H559]] “and cast me [[H2904]] into [[H413]] the sea, [[H3220]] so it [[H3220]] may quiet down [[H8367]] for you. [[H5921]] For [[H3588]] I [[H589]] know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I am to blame [[H7945]] for this [[H2088]] violent [[H1419]] storm [[H5591]] that has come upon you.” [[H5921]]

###### 13
Nevertheless, the men [[H582]] rowed hard [[H2864]] to get back [[H7725]] to [[H413]] dry land, [[H3004]] but they [[H3808]] could not, [[H3201]] for [[H3588]] the sea [[H3220]] was raging [[H5590]] against [[H5921]] them more and more. [[H1980]]

###### 14
So they cried out [[H7121]] to [[H413]] the LORD: [[H3068]] “Please, [[H577]] O LORD, [[H3068]] do not [[H408]] let us perish [[H6]] on account of this [[H2088]] man's [[H376]] life! [[H5315]] Do not [[H408]] charge [[H5414]] us [[H5921]] with innocent [[H5355]] blood! [[H1818]] For [[H3588]] You, [[H859]] O LORD, [[H3068]] have done [[H6213]] as [[H834]] You pleased.” [[H2654]]

###### 15
At this, they picked up [[H5375]] Jonah [[H3124]] and threw [[H2904]] him into [[H413]] the sea, [[H3220]] and the raging [[H2197]] sea [[H3220]] grew calm. [[H5975]]

###### 16
Then the men [[H376]] feared [[H3372]] the LORD [[H3068]] greatly, [[H1419]] and they offered [[H2076]] a sacrifice [[H2077]] to the LORD [[H3068]] and made [[H5087]] vows [to Him]. [[H5088]]

###### 17
Now the LORD [[H3068]] had appointed [[H4487]] a great [[H1419]] fish [[H1709]] to swallow [[H1104]] Jonah, [[H3124]] and Jonah [[H3124]] spent [[H1961]] three [[H7969]] days [[H3117]] and three [[H7969]] nights [[H3915]] in the stomach [[H4578]] of the fish. [[H1709]]
