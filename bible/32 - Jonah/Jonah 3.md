###### 1
Then the word [[H1697]] of the LORD [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] to [[H413]] Jonah [[H3124]] a second time: [[H8145]]

###### 2
“Arise! [[H6965]] Go [[H1980]] to [[H413]] the great [[H1419]] city [[H5892]] of Nineveh [[H5210]] and proclaim [[H7121]] the message [[H7150]] that [[H834]] I [[H595]] will give [[H1696]] you.” [[H413]]

###### 3
This time Jonah [[H3124]] got up [[H6965]] and went [[H1980]] to [[H413]] Nineveh [[H5210]] in accordance with the word [[H1697]] of the LORD. [[H3068]] Now Nineveh [[H5210]] was [[H1961]] an exceedingly [[H430]] great [[H1419]] city, [[H5892]] a three-day [[H7969]] journey [to cross]. [[H4109]]

###### 4
On the first [[H259]] day [[H3117]] of his walk, [[H4109]] Jonah [[H3124]] set out [[H2490]] into the city [[H5892]] and proclaimed, [[H7121]] “Forty [[H705]] more [[H5750]] days [[H3117]] and Nineveh [[H5210]] will be overturned!” [[H2015]]

###### 5
And the Ninevites [[H5210]] believed [[H539]] God. [[H430]] They proclaimed [[H7121]] a fast [[H6685]] and dressed [[H3847]] in sackcloth, [[H8242]] from the greatest [[H1419]] of them to [[H5704]] the least. [[H6996]]

###### 6
When word [[H1697]] reached [[H5060]] the king [[H4428]] of Nineveh, [[H5210]] he got up [[H6965]] from his throne, [[H3678]] took off [[H5674]] his royal robe, [[H155]] covered [himself] [[H3680]] with sackcloth, [[H8242]] and sat [[H3427]] in [[H5921]] ashes. [[H665]]

###### 7
Then he issued a proclamation [[H2199]] in Nineveh: [[H5210]] “By the decree [[H2940]] of the king [[H4428]] and his nobles: [[H1419]] Let no [[H408]] man [[H120]] or beast, [[H929]] herd [[H1241]] or flock, [[H6629]] taste [[H2938]] anything at all. [[H3972]] They must not [[H408]] eat [[H7462]] or drink. [[H8354]]

###### 8
Furthermore, let both man [[H120]] and beast [[H929]] be covered [[H3680]] with sackcloth, [[H8242]] and have everyone call out [[H7121]] earnestly [[H2394]] to [[H413]] God. [[H430]] Let each one [[H376]] turn [[H7725]] from [[H4480]] his evil [[H7451]] ways [[H1870]] and from the violence [[H2555]] in his hands. [[H3709]]

###### 9
Who [[H4310]] knows? [[H3045]] God [[H430]] may turn [[H7725]] and relent; [[H5162]] He may turn [[H7725]] from His fierce [[H2740]] anger, [[H639]] so that we will not [[H3808]] perish.” [[H6]]

###### 10
When God [[H430]] saw [[H7200]] their actions— [[H4639]] that [[H3588]] they had turned [[H7725]] from their evil [[H7451]] ways— [[H1870]] [He] [[H430]] relented [[H5162]] from [[H5921]] the disaster [[H7451]] He had threatened [[H1696]] to bring [[H6213]] upon them. [[H1992]]
