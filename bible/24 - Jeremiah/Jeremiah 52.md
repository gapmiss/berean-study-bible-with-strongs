###### 1
Zedekiah [[H6667]] was twenty-one [[H6242]] years [[H8141]] old [[H1121]] when he became king, [[H4427]] and he reigned [[H4427]] in Jerusalem [[H3389]] eleven [[H259]] years. [[H8141]] His mother’s [[H517]] name [[H8034]] was Hamutal [[H2537]] daughter [[H1323]] of Jeremiah; [[H3414]] she was from Libnah. [[H3841]]

###### 2
And [Zedekiah] did [[H6213]] evil [[H7451]] in the sight [[H5869]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] just as [[H3605]] Jehoiakim [[H3079]] had done. [[H6213]]

###### 3
For [[H3588]] because [[H5921]] of the anger [[H639]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] [all this] happened [[H1961]] in Jerusalem [[H3389]] and Judah, [[H3063]] until [[H5704]] He finally banished [[H7993]] them [[H853]] from [[H5921]] His presence. [[H6440]] And Zedekiah also [[H6667]] rebelled [[H4775]] against the king [[H4428]] of Babylon. [[H894]]

###### 4
So [[H1961]] in the ninth [[H8671]] year [[H8141]] of Zedekiah’s reign, [[H4427]] on the tenth [[H6218]] day of the tenth [[H6224]] month, [[H2320]] King [[H4428]] Nebuchadnezzar [[H5019]] of Babylon [[H894]] marched [[H935]] against [[H5921]] Jerusalem [[H3389]] with his entire [[H3605]] army. [[H2428]] They encamped [[H2583]] outside [the city] [[H5921]] and built [[H1129]] a siege wall [[H1785]] all around it. [[H5439]]

###### 5
And the city [[H5892]] was kept [[H935]] under siege [[H4692]] until [[H5704]] King [[H4428]] Zedekiah’s [[H6667]] eleventh [[H6249]] year. [[H8141]]

###### 6
By the ninth [day] [[H8672]] of the fourth [[H7243]] month, [[H2320]] the famine [[H7458]] in the city [[H5892]] was so severe [[H2388]] that the people [[H5971]] of the land [[H776]] had [[H1961]] no [[H3808]] food. [[H3899]]

###### 7
Then the city [[H5892]] was breached, [[H1234]] and though the Chaldeans [[H3778]] had surrounded [[H5439]] the city, [[H5892]] all [[H3605]] the men [[H376]] of war [[H4421]] fled. [[H1272]] the city [[H5892]] by night [[H3915]] by way [[H1870]] of the gate [[H8179]] between [[H996]] the two walls [[H2346]] near [[H5921]] the king’s [[H4428]] garden. [[H1588]] They fled [[H1980]] toward [[H1870]] the Arabah, [[H6160]]

###### 8
but the army [[H2428]] of the Chaldeans [[H3778]] pursued [[H7291]] the king [[H4428]] and overtook [[H5381]] Zedekiah [[H6667]] in the plains [[H6160]] of Jericho, [[H3405]] and all [[H3605]] his army [[H2428]] was separated [[H6327]] from him. [[H5921]]

###### 9
[The Chaldeans] seized [[H8610]] the king [[H4428]] and brought him up [[H5927]] to [[H413]] the king [[H4428]] of Babylon [[H894]] at Riblah [[H7247]] in the land [[H776]] of Hamath, [[H2574]] where he pronounced [[H1696]] judgment [[H4941]] on [Zedekiah]. [[H854]]

###### 10
There at Riblah [[H7247]] the king [[H4428]] of Babylon [[H894]] slaughtered [[H7819]] Zedekiah’s [[H6667]] sons [[H1121]] before his eyes, [[H5869]] and he also killed [[H7819]] all [[H3605]] the officials [[H8269]] of Judah. [[H3063]]

###### 11
Then he put out [[H5786]] Zedekiah’s [[H6667]] eyes, [[H5869]] bound [[H631]] him [[H4428]] in bronze shackles [[H5178]] and took him [[H935]] to Babylon, [[H894]] [where] [[H894]] he kept [[H5414]] him in custody [[H1004]] until [[H5704]] his dying [[H4194]] day. [[H3117]]

###### 12
On the tenth [[H6218]] day of the fifth [[H2549]] month, [[H2320]] in the nineteenth [[H8672]] year [[H8141]] of Nebuchadnezzar's [[H5019]] reign [[H4428]] over Babylon, [[H894]] Nebuzaradan [[H5018]] the captain [[H7227]] of the guard, [[H2876]] a servant [[H5975]] of the king [[H4428]] of Babylon, [[H894]] entered [[H935]] Jerusalem. [[H3389]]

###### 13
He burned down [[H8313]] the house [[H1004]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] the royal [[H4428]] palace, [[H1004]] and all [[H3605]] the houses [[H1004]] of Jerusalem— [[H3389]] every [[H3605]] significant [[H1419]] building. [[H1004]]

###### 14
And the whole [[H3605]] army [[H2428]] of the Chaldeans [[H3778]] under [[H854]] the captain [[H7227]] of the guard [[H2876]] broke down [[H5422]] all [[H3605]] the walls [[H2346]] around [[H5439]] Jerusalem. [[H3389]]

###### 15
Then Nebuzaradan [[H5018]] the captain [[H7227]] of the guard [[H2876]] carried into exile [[H1540]] [some of] the poorest [[H1803]] people [[H5971]] and [[H853]] those who remained [[H3499]] in the city, [[H5892]] along with [[H853]] the deserters [[H5307]] who [[H834]] had defected [[H5307]] to [[H413]] the king [[H4428]] of Babylon [[H894]] and the rest [[H3499]] of the craftsmen. [[H527]]

###### 16
But Nebuzaradan [[H5018]] the captain [[H7227]] of the guard [[H2876]] left behind [[H7604]] [the rest of] the poor [[H1803]] of the land [[H776]] to be vinedressers [[H3755]] and farmers. [[H3009]]

###### 17
Moreover, [[H853]] the Chaldeans [[H3778]] broke up [[H7665]] the bronze [[H5178]] pillars [[H5982]] and [[H853]] the stands [[H4350]] and the bronze [[H5178]] sea [[H3220]] in the house [[H1004]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] and they carried [[H5375]] all [[H3605]] the bronze [[H5178]] to Babylon. [[H894]]

###### 18
They also took away [[H3947]] the pots, [[H5518]] shovels, [[H3257]] wick trimmers, [[H4212]] sprinkling basins, [[H4219]] dishes, [[H3709]] and all [[H3605]] the articles [[H3627]] of bronze [[H5178]] used in the temple service. [[H8334]]

###### 19
The captain [[H7227]] of the guard [[H2876]] also took away [[H3947]] the bowls, [[H5592]] censers, [[H4289]] sprinkling basins, [[H4219]] pots, [[H5518]] lampstands, [[H4501]] pans, [[H3709]] and drink offering bowls— [[H4518]] anything [made of] [[H834]] pure gold [[H2091]] or fine silver. [[H3701]]

###### 20
As for the two [[H8147]] pillars, [[H5982]] the [[H259]] sea, [[H3220]] the twelve [[H8147]] bronze [[H5178]] bulls [[H1241]] under it, [[H8478]] and the movable stands [[H4350]] that [[H834]] King [[H4428]] Solomon [[H8010]] had made [[H6213]] for the house [[H1004]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] the weight [[H4948]] of the bronze [[H5178]] from all [[H3605]] these [[H428]] articles [[H3627]] was beyond measure. [[H1961]]

###### 21
Each [[H259]] pillar [[H5982]] [was] eighteen [[H8083]] cubits [[H520]] tall [[H6967]] and twelve [[H8147]] cubits [[H520]] in circumference; [[H5437]] [each] was hollow, [[H5014]] four [[H702]] fingers [[H676]] thick. [[H5672]]

###### 22
The bronze [[H5178]] capital [[H3805]] atop [[H5921]] one [pillar] [[H259]] [was] five [[H2568]] cubits [[H520]] high, [[H6967]] with a network [[H7639]] of bronze [[H5178]] pomegranates [[H7416]] all around. [[H5439]] The second [[H8145]] pillar, [[H5982]] with [its] pomegranates, [[H7416]] [was] similar. [[H428]]

###### 23
[Each capital had] [[H1961]] ninety-six [[H8673]] pomegranates [[H7416]] all around it. [[H3605]] All the pomegranates [[H7416]] around [[H5439]] the latticework [[H7639]] [numbered] a hundred. [[H3967]]

###### 24
The captain [[H7227]] of the guard [[H2876]] also took away [[H3947]] Seraiah [[H8304]] the chief [[H7218]] priest, [[H3548]] Zephaniah [[H6846]] the priest [[H3548]] of the second rank, [[H4932]] and the three [[H7969]] doorkeepers. [[H8104]]

###### 25
Of those [[H4480]] still in the city, [[H5892]] he took [[H3947]] a [[H259]] court official [[H5631]] who [[H834]] had been [[H1961]] appointed [[H6496]] over [[H5921]] the men [[H582]] of war, [[H376]] seven [[H7651]] trusted royal [[H4428]] advisers, [[H7200]] as well as [[H853]] the scribe [[H5608]] of the captain [[H8269]] of the army, [[H6635]] who enlisted [[H6633]] the people [[H5971]] of the land, [[H776]] and sixty [[H8346]] men [[H5971]] who were found [[H4672]] in [[H8432]] the city. [[H5892]]

###### 26
Nebuzaradan [[H5018]] the captain [[H7227]] of the guard [[H2876]] took [[H3947]] them [[H853]] and brought [[H1980]] them to [[H413]] the king [[H4428]] of Babylon [[H894]] at Riblah. [[H7247]]

###### 27
There at Riblah [[H7247]] in the land [[H776]] of Hamath, [[H2574]] The king [[H4428]] of Babylon [[H894]] struck [[H5221]] them {down} [[H853]] and put them to death. [[H4191]] So Judah [[H3063]] was taken into exile, [[H1540]] away from [[H5921]] her land. [[H127]]

###### 28
These [[H2088]] are the people [[H5971]] Nebuchadnezzar [[H5019]] carried away: [[H1540]] in the seventh [[H7651]] year, [[H8141]] 3,023 {} [[H7969]] Jews; [[H3064]]

###### 29
in Nebuchadnezzar’s [[H5019]] eighteenth [[H8083]] year, [[H8141]] 832 [[H8083]] people [[H5315]] from Jerusalem; [[H3389]]

###### 30
in Nebuchadnezzar’s [[H5019]] twenty-third [[H7969]] year, [[H8141]] Nebuzaradan [[H5018]] the captain [[H7227]] of the guard [[H2876]] carried away [[H1540]] 745 [[H7651]] Jews. [[H3064]] So altogether, [[H3605]] 4,600 [[H702]] people [were taken away]. [[H5315]]

###### 31
Now [[H1961]] on the twenty-fifth [[H6242]] day of the twelfth [[H8147]] month [[H2320]] of the thirty-seventh [[H7970]] year [[H8141]] of the exile [[H1546]] of Jehoiachin [[H3078]] king [[H4428]] of Judah, [[H3063]] in the first year [[H8141]] of the reign [[H4438]] of Evil-merodach [[H192]] king [[H4428]] of Babylon, [[H894]] he pardoned [[H5375]] Jehoiachin [[H3078]] king [[H4428]] of Judah [[H3063]] and released [[H3318]] him from [[H853]] prison. [[H1004]]

###### 32
He spoke [[H1696]] kindly [[H2896]] [to Jehoiachin] [[H853]] and set [[H5414]] his throne [[H3678]] above [[H4605]] the thrones [[H3678]] of the other kings [[H4428]] with [him] [[H854]] in Babylon. [[H894]]

###### 33
So Jehoiachin changed [[H8138]] his prison [[H3608]] clothes, [[H899]] and he dined [[H398]] regularly [[H8548]] at the king’s table [[H6440]] for the rest [[H3605]] of his days. [[H3117]]

###### 34
And the king [[H4428]] of Babylon [[H894]] allotted [[H737]] to him  a daily [[H3117]] portion [[H1697]] for the rest [[H3605]] of his life, [[H2416]] until [[H5704]] the day [[H3117]] of his death. [[H4194]]
