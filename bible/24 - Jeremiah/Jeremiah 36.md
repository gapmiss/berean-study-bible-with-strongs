### 1
In the fourth [[H7243]] year [[H8141]] of Jehoiakim [[H3079]] son [[H1121]] of Josiah [[H2977]] king [[H4428]] of Judah, [[H3063]] this [[H2088]] word [[H1697]] came [[H1961]] to [[H413]] Jeremiah [[H3414]] from the LORD: [[H3068]]

### 2
“Take [[H3947]] a scroll [[H4039]] and write [[H3789]] on [[H413]] it all [[H3605]] the words [[H1697]] I have spoken [[H1696]] to [[H413]] you concerning [[H5921]] Israel, [[H3478]] Judah, [[H3063]] and all [[H3605]] the nations, [[H1471]] from the day [[H3117]] I first spoke [[H1696]] to you [[H413]] during the reign [[H3117]] of Josiah [[H2977]] until today. [[H5704]]

### 3
Perhaps [[H194]] when the people [[H1004]] of Judah [[H3063]] hear [[H8085]] about all [[H3605]] the calamity [[H7451]] I [[H595]] plan [[H2803]] to bring [[H6213]] upon them,  each of them [[H376]] will turn [[H7725]] from his wicked [[H7451]] way. [[H1870]] Then I will forgive [[H5545]] their iniquity [[H5771]] and their sin.” [[H2403]]

### 4
So Jeremiah [[H3414]] called [[H7121]] Baruch [[H1263]] son [[H1121]] of Neriah. [[H5374]] At the dictation [[H6310]] of Jeremiah, [[H3414]] Baruch [[H1263]] wrote [[H3789]] on [[H5921]] a scroll [[H4039]] all [[H3605]] the words [[H1697]] the LORD [[H3068]] had spoken [[H1696]] to Jeremiah. [[H413]]

### 5
Then Jeremiah [[H3414]] commanded [[H6680]] Baruch, [[H1263]] “I [[H589]] am restricted; [[H6113]] I cannot [[H3808]] enter [[H935]] the temple [[H1004]] of the LORD; [[H3068]]

### 6
so you [[H859]] are to go [[H935]] to the house [[H1004]] of the LORD [[H3068]] on a day [[H3117]] of fasting, [[H6685]] and in the hearing [[H241]] of the people [[H5971]] you are to read [[H7121]] the words [[H1697]] of the LORD [[H3068]] from the scroll [[H4039]] you wrote [[H3789]] at my dictation. [[H6310]] Read them [[H7121]] in the hearing [[H241]] of all [[H3605]] [the people of] Judah [[H3063]] who are coming [[H935]] from their cities. [[H5892]]

### 7
Perhaps [[H194]] they will bring [[H5307]] their petition [[H8467]] before [[H6440]] the LORD, [[H3069]] and each [[H376]] one will turn [[H7725]] from his wicked [[H7451]] way; [[H1870]] for [[H3588]] great are [[H1419]] the anger [[H639]] and fury [[H2534]] that [[H834]] the LORD [[H3069]] has pronounced [[H1696]] against [[H413]] this [[H2088]] people.” [[H5971]]

### 8
So Baruch [[H1263]] son [[H1121]] of Neriah [[H5374]] did [[H6213]] everything [[H3605]] Jeremiah [[H3414]] the prophet [[H5030]] had commanded him. [[H6680]] In the house [[H1004]] of the LORD [[H3068]] he read [[H7121]] the words [[H1697]] of the LORD [[H3068]] from the scroll. [[H5612]]

### 9
Now [[H1961]] in the ninth [[H8671]] month [[H2320]] of the fifth [[H2549]] year [[H8141]] of Jehoiakim [[H3079]] son [[H1121]] of Josiah [[H2977]] king [[H4428]] of Judah, [[H3063]] a fast [[H6685]] before [[H6440]] the LORD [[H3068]] was proclaimed [[H7121]] to all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] of Jerusalem [[H3389]] and all [[H3605]] who had come [[H935]] [there] [[H3389]] from the cities [[H5892]] of Judah. [[H3063]]

### 10
From the chamber [[H3957]] of Gemariah [[H1587]] son [[H1121]] of Shaphan [[H8227]] the scribe, [[H5608]] which was in the upper [[H5945]] courtyard [[H2691]] at the opening [[H6607]] of the New [[H2319]] Gate [[H8179]] of the house [[H1004]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] Baruch [[H1263]] read [[H7121]] from the scroll [[H5612]] the words [[H1697]] of Jeremiah [[H3414]] in the hearing [[H241]] of all [[H3605]] the people. [[H5971]]

### 11
When Micaiah [[H4321]] son [[H1121]] of Gemariah, [[H1587]] the son [[H1121]] of Shaphan, [[H8227]] heard [[H8085]] all [[H3605]] the words [[H1697]] of the LORD [[H3068]] from [[H5921]] the scroll, [[H5612]]

### 12
he went down [[H3381]] to [[H5921]] the scribe’s [[H5608]] chamber [[H3957]] in the king’s [[H4428]] palace, [[H1004]] where [[H8033]] all [[H3605]] the officials [[H8269]] were sitting: [[H3427]] Elishama [[H476]] the scribe, [[H5608]] Delaiah [[H1806]] son [[H1121]] of Shemaiah, [[H8098]] Elnathan [[H494]] son [[H1121]] of Achbor, [[H5907]] Gemariah [[H1587]] son [[H1121]] of Shaphan, [[H8227]] Zedekiah [[H6667]] son [[H1121]] of Hananiah, [[H2608]] and all [[H3605]] the other officials. [[H8269]]

### 13
And Micaiah [[H4321]] reported [[H5046]] to them all [[H3605]] the words [[H1697]] he had heard [[H8085]] Baruch [[H1263]] read [[H7121]] from the scroll [[H5612]] in the hearing [[H241]] of the people. [[H5971]]

### 14
Then all [[H3605]] the officials [[H8269]] sent [[H7971]] word to [[H413]] Baruch [[H1263]] through Jehudi [[H3065]] son [[H1121]] of Nethaniah, [[H5418]] son [[H1121]] of Shelemiah, [[H8018]] son [[H1121]] of Cushi, [[H3570]] saying, [[H559]] “Bring [[H3947]] the scroll [[H4039]] that [[H834]] you read [[H7121]] in the hearing [[H241]] of the people, [[H5971]] and come.” [[H1980]] So Baruch [[H1263]] son [[H1121]] of Neriah [[H5374]] took [[H3947]] the scroll [[H4039]] and went [[H935]] to them. [[H413]]

### 15
“Please [[H4994]] sit down,” [[H3427]] they said, [[H559]] “and read [[H7121]] it in our hearing.” [[H241]] So Baruch [[H1263]] read [[H7121]] it in their hearing. [[H241]]

### 16
When they had heard [[H8085]] all [[H3605]] these words, [[H1697]] they turned to [[H413]] each [[H376]] other [[H7453]] in fear [[H6342]] and said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Baruch, [[H1263]] “Surely we must report [[H5046]] all [[H3605]] these [[H428]] words [[H1697]] to the king.” [[H4428]]

### 17
“Tell us [[H5046]] now,” [[H4994]] they asked [[H7592]] Baruch, [[H1263]] “how [[H349]] did you write [[H3789]] all [[H3605]] these [[H428]] words? [[H1697]] [Was it] at [Jeremiah’s] dictation?” [[H6310]]

### 18
“[It was] at  his dictation,” [[H6310]] Baruch [[H1263]] replied. [[H559]] “He recited [[H7121]] all [[H3605]] these [[H428]] words [[H1697]] to me [[H413]] and I [[H589]] wrote [them] [[H3789]] in ink [[H1773]] on [[H5921]] the scroll.” [[H5612]]

### 19
Then the officials [[H8269]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Baruch, [[H1263]] “You [[H859]] and Jeremiah [[H3414]] must hide [[H5641]] yourselves [[H3045]] and let no [[H408]] one [know] [[H376]] where [[H375]] you are.” [[H859]]

### 20
So [the officials] went [[H935]] to [[H413]] the king [[H4428]] in the courtyard. [[H2691]] And [[H853]] having stored [[H6485]] the scroll [[H4039]] in the chamber [[H3957]] of Elishama [[H476]] the scribe, [[H5608]] they reported [[H5046]] everything [[H3605]] to [[H241]] the king. [[H4428]]

### 21
The king [[H4428]] sent [[H7971]] Jehudi [[H3065]] to get [[H3947]] the scroll, [[H4039]] and he took it [[H3947]] from the chamber [[H3957]] of Elishama [[H476]] the scribe. [[H5608]] And Jehudi [[H3065]] read it [[H7121]] in the hearing [[H241]] of the king [[H4428]] and all [[H3605]] the officials [[H8269]] who were standing [[H5975]] beside [[H5921]] [him]. [[H4428]]

### 22
Since it was the ninth [[H8671]] month, [[H2320]] the king [[H4428]] was sitting [[H3427]] in his winter [[H2779]] quarters [[H1004]] with a fire [[H254]] burning [[H1197]] before him. [[H6440]]

### 23
And [[H1961]] as soon as Jehudi [[H3065]] had read [[H7121]] three [[H7969]] or four [[H702]] columns, [[H1817]] Jehoiakim would cut [them off] [[H7167]] with a scribe’s [[H5608]] knife [[H8593]] and throw [them] [[H7993]] into [[H413]] the firepot, [[H254]] until [[H5704]] the entire [[H3605]] scroll [[H4039]] had been consumed [[H8552]] by [[H5921]] the fire. [[H784]]

### 24
Yet in hearing [[H8085]] all [[H3605]] these [[H428]] words, [[H1697]] the king [[H4428]] [and] [[H3605]] his servants [[H5650]] did not [[H3808]] become frightened [[H6342]] or tear [[H7167]] their garments. [[H899]]

### 25
Even though [[H1571]] Elnathan, [[H494]] Delaiah, [[H1806]] and Gemariah [[H1587]] had urged [[H6293]] the king [[H4428]] not [[H1115]] to burn [[H8313]] the scroll, [[H4039]] he would not [[H3808]] listen [[H8085]] to them. [[H413]]

### 26
Instead, the king [[H4428]] commanded [[H6680]] Jerahmeel, [[H3396]] a son [[H1121]] of the king, [[H4429]] as well as [[H853]] Seraiah [[H8304]] son [[H1121]] of Azriel [[H5837]] and Shelemiah [[H8018]] son [[H1121]] of Abdeel, [[H5655]] to seize [[H3947]] Baruch [[H1263]] the scribe [[H5608]] and Jeremiah [[H3414]] the prophet. [[H5030]] But the LORD [[H3068]] had hidden them. [[H5641]]

### 27
After [[H310]] the king [[H4428]] had burned [[H8313]] the scroll [[H4039]] with the words [[H1697]] Baruch [[H1263]] had written [[H3789]] at Jeremiah’s [[H3414]] dictation, [[H6310]] the word [[H1697]] of the LORD [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] to [[H413]] Jeremiah: [[H3414]]

### 28
“Take [[H3947]] another [[H312]] scroll [[H4039]] and [[H7725]] rewrite [[H3789]] on it [[H5921]] the very words [[H1697]] that [[H834]] were [[H1961]] on [[H5921]] the original [[H7223]] scroll, [[H4039]] which [[H834]] Jehoiakim [[H3079]] king [[H4428]] of Judah [[H3063]] has burned. [[H8313]]

### 29
You are to proclaim [[H559]] concerning [[H5921]] Jehoiakim [[H3079]] king [[H4428]] of Judah [[H3063]] that this is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] says: [[H559]] You [[H859]] have burned [[H8313]] the [[H2063]] scroll [[H4039]] and said, [[H559]] ‘Why [[H4069]] have you written [[H3789]] on it [[H5921]] that [[H559]] the king [[H4428]] of Babylon [[H894]] would surely come [[H935]] and destroy [[H7843]] this [[H2063]] land [[H776]] and deprive it [[H7673]] of [[H4480]] man [[H120]] and beast? [[H929]]

### 30
Therefore, [[H3651]] this is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] says [[H559]] about [[H5921]] Jehoiakim [[H3079]] king [[H4428]] of Judah: [[H3063]] He will have [[H1961]] no [[H3808]] one to sit [[H3427]] on [[H5921]] David’s [[H1732]] throne, [[H3678]] and his body [[H5038]] will be [[H1961]] thrown out [[H7993]] to be exposed to heat [[H2721]] by day [[H3117]] and frost [[H7140]] by night. [[H3915]]

### 31
I will punish him [[H6485]] and his descendants [[H2233]] and servants [[H5650]] for their iniquity. [[H5771]] I will bring [[H935]] on them, [[H5921]] on [[H5921]] the residents [[H3427]] of Jerusalem, [[H3389]] and on [[H413]] the men [[H376]] of Judah, [[H3063]] all [[H3605]] the calamity [[H7451]] about which [[H834]] I warned them [[H1696]] but they did not [[H3808]] listen.” [[H8085]]

### 32
Then Jeremiah [[H3414]] took [[H3947]] another [[H312]] scroll [[H4039]] and gave [[H5414]] it to [[H413]] the scribe [[H5608]] Baruch [[H1263]] son [[H1121]] of Neriah, [[H5374]] and at Jeremiah’s [[H3414]] dictation [[H6310]] he wrote [[H3789]] on it [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] the words [[H1697]] of the scroll [[H5612]] that [[H834]] Jehoiakim [[H3079]] king [[H4428]] of Judah [[H3063]] had burned [[H8313]] in the fire. [[H784]] And many [[H7227]] similar [[H5750]] words [[H1697]] were added [[H3254]] to them. [[H5921]]
