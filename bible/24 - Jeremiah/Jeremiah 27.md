### 1
At the beginning [[H7225]] of the reign [[H4467]] of Zedekiah [[H3079]] son [[H1121]] of Josiah [[H2977]] king [[H4428]] of Judah, [[H3063]] this [[H2088]] word [[H1697]] came [[H1961]] to [[H413]] Jeremiah [[H3414]] from the LORD: [[H3069]]

### 2
“This is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H559]] to me: [[H413]] Make [[H6213]] for yourself  a yoke [[H4133]] out of leather straps [[H4147]] and put it [[H5414]] on [[H5921]] your neck. [[H6677]]

### 3
Send [[H7971]] word to [[H413]] the kings [[H4428]] of Edom, [[H123]] Moab, [[H4124]] Ammon, [[H1121]] Tyre, [[H6865]] and [[H4428]] Sidon [[H6721]] through [[H3027]] the envoys [[H4397]] who have come [[H935]] to Jerusalem [[H3389]] to [[H413]] Zedekiah [[H6667]] king [[H4428]] of Judah. [[H3063]]

### 4
Give them a message [[H6680]] for their [[H413]] masters [[H113]] declaring that [[H559]] this is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts, [[H6635]] the God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] says [[H559]] that [[H3541]] you are to tell [[H559]] [them]: [[H113]]

### 5
By My great [[H1419]] power [[H3581]] and outstretched [[H5186]] arm, [[H2220]] I [[H595]] made [[H6213]] the earth [[H776]] and the men [[H120]] and [[H853]] beasts [[H929]] on [[H5921]] the face [[H6440]] of [it], [[H776]] and I give it [[H5414]] to whom [[H834]] I please. [[H3474]]

### 6
So now [[H6258]] I [[H595]] have placed [[H5414]] all [[H3605]] these [[H428]] lands [[H776]] under the authority [[H3027]] of My servant [[H5650]] Nebuchadnezzar, [[H5019]] king [[H4428]] of Babylon. [[H894]] I have even [[H1571]] made [[H5414]] the beasts [[H2416]] of the field [[H7704]] subject [[H5647]] to him. 

### 7
All [[H3605]] nations [[H1471]] will serve him [[H5647]] and [[H853]] his son [[H1121]] and grandson, [[H1121]] until [[H5704]] the time [[H6256]] of his own land [[H776]] comes; [[H935]] then many [[H7227]] nations [[H1471]] and great [[H1419]] kings [[H4428]] will enslave him. [[H5647]]

### 8
As for the nation [[H1471]] or kingdom [[H4467]] that [[H834]] does not [[H3808]] serve [[H5647]] Nebuchadnezzar [[H5019]] king [[H4428]] of Babylon [[H894]] and does not [[H3808]] place [[H5414]] its neck [[H6677]] under [his] yoke, [[H5923]] I will punish [[H6485]] that [[H1931]] nation [[H1471]] by sword [[H2719]] and famine [[H7458]] and plague, [[H1698]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD, [[H3068]] until [[H5704]] I have destroyed [[H8552]] it [[H853]] by his hand. [[H3027]]

### 9
But as for you, [[H859]] do not [[H408]] listen [[H8085]] to [[H413]] your prophets, [[H5030]] your diviners, [[H7080]] your interpreters of dreams, [[H2472]] your mediums, [[H6049]] or your sorcerers [[H3786]] who [[H834]] tell [[H559]] you, [[H413]] ‘You shall not [[H3808]] serve [[H5647]] the king [[H4428]] of Babylon.’ [[H894]]

### 10
For [[H3588]] they [[H1992]] prophesy [[H5012]] to you  a lie [[H8267]] that will serve [[H4616]] to remove you [[H7368]] from [[H5921]] your land; [[H127]] I will banish you [[H5080]] and you will perish. [[H6]]

### 11
But the nation [[H1471]] that [[H834]] will put [[H935]] its neck [[H6677]] under the yoke [[H5923]] of the king [[H4428]] of Babylon [[H894]] and serve him, [[H5647]] I will leave [[H3240]] it in [[H5921]] its own land, [[H127]] to cultivate it [[H5647]] and reside [[H3427]] in it,  declares [[H5002]] the LORD.” [[H3068]]

### 12
And to [[H413]] Zedekiah [[H6667]] king [[H4428]] of Judah [[H3063]] I spoke [[H1696]] the same [[H3605]] message: [[H1697]] “Put [[H935]] your necks [[H6677]] under the yoke [[H5923]] of the king [[H4428]] of Babylon; [[H894]] serve [[H5647]] him and his people, [[H5971]] and live! [[H2421]]

### 13
Why [[H4100]] should you [[H859]] and your people [[H5971]] die [[H4191]] by the sword, [[H2719]] famine, [[H7458]] and plague, [[H1698]] as [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] has decreed [[H1696]] against [[H413]] any nation [[H1471]] that [[H834]] does not [[H3808]] serve [[H5647]] the king [[H4428]] of Babylon? [[H894]]

### 14
Do not [[H408]] listen [[H8085]] to [[H413]] the words [[H1697]] of the prophets [[H5030]] who tell [[H559]] you, [[H413]] ‘You must not [[H3808]] serve [[H5647]] the king [[H4428]] of Babylon,’ [[H894]] for [[H3588]] they [[H1992]] are prophesying [[H5012]] to you  a lie. [[H8267]]

### 15
‘For [[H3588]] I have not [[H3808]] sent them,’ [[H7971]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD, [[H3068]] ‘and yet they [[H1992]] are prophesying [[H5012]] falsely [[H8267]] in My name; [[H8034]] therefore [[H4616]] I will banish you [[H5080]] and you will perish— [[H6]] you [[H859]] and the prophets [[H5030]] who prophesy [[H5012]] to you.’” 

### 16
Then I said [[H1696]] to [[H413]] the priests [[H3548]] and all [[H3605]] this [[H2088]] people, [[H5971]] “This is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] says: [[H559]] Do not [[H408]] listen [[H8085]] to [[H413]] the words [[H1697]] of your prophets [[H5030]] who prophesy [[H5012]] to you,  saying, [[H559]] ‘Look, [[H2009]] very soon [[H4120]] now [[H6258]] the articles [[H3627]] of the LORDs [[H3068]] temple [[H1004]] will be brought back [[H7725]] from Babylon. [[H894]] They [[H1992]] are prophesying [[H5012]] to you  a lie. [[H8267]]

### 17
Do not [[H408]] listen [[H8085]] to them. [[H413]] Serve [[H5647]] the king [[H4428]] of Babylon [[H894]] and live! [[H2421]] Why [[H4100]] should this [[H2063]] city [[H5892]] become [[H1961]] a ruin? [[H2723]]

### 18
If [[H518]] they [[H1992]] are indeed prophets [[H5030]] and [[H518]] the word [[H1697]] of the LORD [[H3068]] is [[H3426]] with them, [[H854]] let them now [[H4994]] plead with [[H6293]] the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts [[H6635]] that the articles [[H3627]] remaining [[H3498]] in the house [[H1004]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] in the palace [[H1004]] of the king [[H4428]] of Judah, [[H3063]] and in Jerusalem, [[H3389]] not [[H1115]] be taken [[H935]] to Babylon. [[H894]]

### 19
For [[H3588]] this is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts [[H6635]] says [[H559]] about [[H413]] the pillars, [[H5982]] the sea, [[H3220]] the bases, [[H4350]] and the rest [[H3499]] of the articles [[H3627]] that still remain [[H3498]] in this [[H2063]] city, [[H5892]]

### 20
which [[H834]] Nebuchadnezzar [[H5019]] king [[H4428]] of Babylon [[H894]] did not [[H3808]] take [[H3947]] when he carried [[H1540]] Jeconiah [[H3204]] son [[H1121]] of Jehoiakim [[H3079]] king [[H4428]] of Judah [[H3063]] {into exile} from Jerusalem [[H3389]] to Babylon, [[H894]] along with [[H853]] all [[H3605]] the nobles [[H2715]] of Judah [[H3063]] and Jerusalem. [[H3389]]

### 21
Yes, [[H3588]] this is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts, [[H6635]] the God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] says [[H559]] about [[H5921]] the articles [[H3627]] that remain [[H3498]] in the house [[H1004]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] in the palace [[H1004]] of the king [[H4428]] of Judah, [[H3063]] and in Jerusalem: [[H3389]]

### 22
‘They will be carried [[H935]] to Babylon [[H894]] and will remain [[H1961]] there [[H8033]] until [[H5704]] the day [[H3117]] I attend to them again,’ [[H6485]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD. [[H3068]] ‘Then I will bring them back [[H5927]] and restore them [[H7725]] to [[H413]] this [[H2088]] place.’” [[H4725]]
