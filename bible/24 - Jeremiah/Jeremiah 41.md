In the seventh [[H7637]] month, [[H2320]] Ishmael [[H3458]] son [[H1121]] of Nethaniah, [[H5418]] the son [[H1121]] of Elishama, [[H476]] [who was a member] of the royal [[H4410]] family [[H2233]] and one of the king’s [[H4428]] chief officers, [[H7227]] came [[H935]] with [[H854]] ten [[H6235]] men [[H376]] to [[H413]] Gedaliah [[H1436]] son [[H1121]] of Ahikam [[H296]] at Mizpah, [[H4709]] and they ate [[H398]] a meal [[H3899]] together [[H3162]] there. [[H8033]]

### 2
Ishmael [[H3458]] son [[H1121]] of Nethaniah [[H5418]] and the ten [[H6235]] men [[H376]] who [[H834]] were [[H1961]] with [[H854]] him got up [[H6965]] and struck down [[H5221]] Gedaliah [[H1436]] son [[H1121]] of Ahikam, [[H296]] the son [[H1121]] of Shaphan, [[H8227]] with the sword, [[H2719]] killing [[H4191]] the one [[H853]] whom [[H834]] the king [[H4428]] of Babylon [[H894]] had appointed to govern [[H6485]] the land. [[H776]]

### 3
Ishmael [[H3458]] also killed [[H5221]] all [[H3605]] the Jews [[H3064]] who [[H834]] were [[H1961]] with [[H854]] Gedaliah [[H1436]] at Mizpah, [[H4709]] as well as the Chaldean [[H3778]] soldiers [[H4421]] who [[H834]] were there. [[H8033]]

### 4
On the second [[H8145]] day [[H3117]] after the murder [[H4191]] of Gedaliah, [[H1436]] when no [[H3808]] one [[H376]] yet knew about it, [[H3045]]

### 5
eighty [[H8084]] men [[H376]] who had shaved off [[H1548]] their beards, [[H2206]] torn [[H7167]] their garments, [[H899]] and cut themselves [[H1413]] came [[H935]] from Shechem, [[H7927]] Shiloh, [[H7887]] and Samaria, [[H8111]] carrying [[H3027]] grain offerings [[H4503]] and incense [[H3828]] to bring [[H935]] to the temple [[H1004]] of the LORD. [[H3068]]

### 6
And Ishmael [[H3458]] son [[H1121]] of Nethaniah [[H5418]] went out [[H3318]] from [[H4480]] Mizpah [[H4709]] to meet them, [[H7125]] weeping [[H1058]] as he went. [[H1980]] When [Ishmael] encountered [the men], [[H6298]] he said, [[H559]] “Come [[H935]] to [[H413]] Gedaliah [[H1436]] son [[H1121]] of Ahikam.” [[H296]]

### 7
And when they came [[H935]] into [[H413]] the city, [[H5892]] Ishmael [[H3458]] son [[H1121]] of Nethaniah [[H5418]] and the men [[H376]] with him [[H854]] slaughtered them [[H7819]] and threw them into [[H413]] a cistern. [[H953]]

### 8
But ten [[H6235]] of the men [[H376]] among them [[H4672]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Ishmael, [[H3458]] “Do not [[H408]] kill us, [[H4191]] for [[H3588]] we have [[H3426]] hidden treasure [[H4301]] in the field— [[H7704]] wheat, [[H2406]] barley, [[H8184]] oil, [[H8081]] and honey!” [[H1706]] So he refrained [[H2308]] from killing them [[H4191]] with [[H8432]] the others. [[H251]]

### 9
Now the cistern [[H953]] into which [[H834]] Ishmael [[H3458]] had thrown [[H7993]] all [[H3605]] the bodies [[H6297]] of the men [[H376]] he had struck down [[H5221]] along with [[H3027]] Gedaliah [[H1436]] was a large one that [[H834]] King [[H4428]] Asa [[H609]] had made [[H6213]] for fear [[H6440]] of Baasha [[H1201]] king [[H4428]] of Israel. [[H3478]] Ishmael [[H3458]] son [[H1121]] of Nethaniah [[H5418]] filled it [[H4390]] with the slain. [[H2491]]

### 10
Then Ishmael [[H3458]] took captive [[H7617]] all [[H3605]] the remnant [[H7611]] of the people [[H5971]] of Mizpah— [[H4709]] the daughters [[H1323]] of the king [[H4428]] along with [[H853]] all [[H3605]] the others [[H5971]] who remained [[H7604]] in Mizpah— [[H4709]] over whom [[H834]] Nebuzaradan [[H5018]] the captain [[H7227]] of the guard [[H2876]] had appointed [[H6485]] Gedaliah [[H1436]] son [[H1121]] of Ahikam. [[H296]] Ishmael [[H3458]] son [[H1121]] of Nethaniah [[H5418]] took them captive [[H7617]] and set off [[H1980]] to cross over [[H5674]] to [[H413]] the Ammonites. [[H1121]]

### 11
When Johanan [[H3110]] son [[H1121]] of Kareah [[H7143]] and all [[H3605]] the commanders [[H8269]] of the armies [[H2428]] with [[H854]] him [[H853]] heard [[H8085]] of all [[H3605]] the crimes [[H7451]] that [[H834]] Ishmael [[H3458]] son [[H1121]] of Nethaniah [[H5418]] had committed, [[H6213]]

### 12
they took [[H3947]] all [[H3605]] their men [[H376]] and went [[H1980]] to fight [[H3898]] Ishmael [[H3458]] son [[H1121]] of Nethaniah. [[H5418]] And they found [[H4672]] him [[H853]] near [[H413]] the great [[H7227]] pool [[H4325]] in Gibeon. [[H1391]]

### 13
When all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] with [[H854]] Ishmael [[H3458]] saw [[H7200]] Johanan [[H3110]] son [[H1121]] of Kareah [[H7143]] and all [[H3605]] the commanders [[H8269]] of the army [[H2428]] with him, [[H854]] they rejoiced, [[H8055]]

### 14
and all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] whom [[H834]] Ishmael [[H3458]] had taken captive [[H7617]] at [[H4480]] Mizpah [[H4709]] turned [[H5437]] and [[H1980]] went over to [[H413]] Johanan [[H3110]] son [[H1121]] of Kareah. [[H7143]]

### 15
But Ishmael [[H3458]] son [[H1121]] of Nethaniah [[H5418]] and eight [[H8083]] [of his] men [[H376]] escaped [[H4422]] from [[H6440]] Johanan [[H3110]] and went [[H1980]] to [[H413]] the Ammonites. [[H1121]]

### 16
Then Johanan [[H3110]] son [[H1121]] of Kareah [[H7143]] and all [[H3605]] the commanders [[H8269]] of the armies [[H2428]] with him [[H854]] took [[H3947]] the whole [[H3605]] remnant [[H7611]] of the people [[H5971]] from [[H4480]] Mizpah [[H4709]] whom [[H834]] he had recovered [[H7725]] from Ishmael [[H3458]] son [[H1121]] of Nethaniah [[H5418]] after [[H310]] Ishmael had killed [[H5221]] Gedaliah [[H1436]] son [[H1121]] of Ahikam: [[H296]] the soldiers, [[H1397]] women, [[H802]] children, [[H2945]] and court officials [[H5631]] he had brought back [[H7725]] from Gibeon. [[H1391]]

### 17
And they went [[H1980]] and stayed [[H3427]] in Geruth [[H1628]] Chimham, [[H681]] near  Bethlehem, [[H1035]] in order to proceed [[H1980]] into Egypt [[H4714]]

### 18
to escape [[H6440]] the Chaldeans. [[H3778]] For [[H3588]] they were afraid [[H3372]] of [the Chaldeans] [[H6440]] because [[H3588]] Ishmael [[H3458]] son [[H1121]] of Nethaniah [[H5418]] had struck down [[H5221]] Gedaliah [[H1436]] son [[H1121]] of Ahikam, [[H296]] whom [[H834]] the king [[H4428]] of Babylon [[H894]] had appointed [[H6485]] over the land.
