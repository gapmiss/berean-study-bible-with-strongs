###### 1
When Jeremiah [[H3414]] had finished [[H3615]] telling [[H1696]] all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] all [[H3605]] the words [[H1697]] of the LORD [[H3068]] their God— [[H430]] everything that [[H3605]] the LORD [[H3068]] had sent him [[H7971]] to [say]— [[H413]]

###### 2
then Azariah [[H5838]] son [[H1121]] of Hoshaiah, [[H1955]] Johanan [[H3110]] son [[H1121]] of Kareah, [[H7143]] and all [[H3605]] the arrogant [[H2086]] men [[H376]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Jeremiah, [[H3414]] “You [[H859]] are lying! [[H8267]] The LORD [[H3068]] our God [[H430]] has not [[H3808]] sent [[H7971]] you to say, [[H559]] ‘You must not [[H3808]] go [[H935]] to Egypt [[H4714]] to reside there. [[H8033]]

###### 3
Rather, [[H3588]] Baruch [[H1263]] son [[H1121]] of Neriah [[H5374]] is inciting [[H5496]] you [[H853]] against us to [[H4616]] hand us over to [[H5414]] the Chaldeans, [[H3778]] so that they may put us to death [[H4191]] or exile [[H1540]] us [[H853]] to Babylon!” [[H894]]

###### 4
So Johanan [[H3110]] son [[H1121]] of Kareah [[H7143]] and all [[H3605]] the commanders [[H8269]] of the forces [[H2428]] disobeyed [[H8085]] the command [[H6963]] of the LORD [[H3068]] to stay [[H3427]] in the land [[H776]] of Judah. [[H3063]]

###### 5
Instead, Johanan [[H3110]] son [[H1121]] of Kareah [[H7143]] and all [[H3605]] the commanders [[H8269]] of the armies [[H2428]] took [[H3947]] the whole [[H3605]] remnant [[H7611]] of Judah, [[H3063]] those who [[H834]] had returned [[H7725]] to the land [[H776]] of Judah [[H3063]] from all [[H3605]] the nations [[H1471]] to which [[H834]] they had been scattered, [[H5080]]

###### 6
the men, [[H1397]] the women, [[H802]] the children, [[H2945]] the king’s [[H4428]] daughters, [[H1323]] and everyone [[H3605]] whom [[H834]] Nebuzaradan [[H5018]] the captain [[H7227]] of the guard [[H2876]] had allowed to remain [[H3240]] with [[H854]] Gedaliah [[H1436]] son [[H1121]] of Ahikam, [[H296]] the son [[H1121]] of Shaphan, [[H8227]] as well as [[H853]] Jeremiah [[H3414]] the prophet [[H5030]] and Baruch [[H1263]] son [[H1121]] of Neriah. [[H5374]]

###### 7
So they entered [[H935]] the land [[H776]] of Egypt [[H4714]] because [[H3588]] they did not [[H3808]] obey [[H8085]] the voice [[H6963]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] and they went [[H935]] as far as [[H5704]] Tahpanhes. [[H8471]]

###### 8
Then the word [[H1697]] of the LORD [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] to [[H413]] Jeremiah [[H3414]] at Tahpanhes: [[H8471]]

###### 9
“In the sight [[H5869]] [of the] Jews, [[H3064]] pick up [[H3947]] some large [[H1419]] stones [[H68]] and bury them [[H2934]] in the clay [[H4423]] of the brick pavement [[H4404]] at the entrance [[H6607]] to Pharaoh’s [[H6547]] palace [[H1004]] at Tahpanhes. [[H8471]]

###### 10
Then say [[H559]] to them, [[H413]] ‘This is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts, [[H6635]] the God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] says: [[H559]] I will send for [[H7971]] My servant [[H5650]] Nebuchadnezzar [[H5019]] king [[H4428]] of Babylon, [[H894]] and I will set [[H7760]] his throne [[H3678]] over [[H4605]] these [[H428]] stones [[H68]] that [[H834]] I have embedded, [[H2934]] and he will spread [[H5186]] his royal pavilion [[H8237]] over them. [[H5921]]

###### 11
He will come [[H935]] and strike down [[H5221]] the land [[H776]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] bringing death [[H4194]] to those [[H834]] destined for death, [[H4194]] captivity [[H7628]] to those [[H834]] destined for captivity, [[H7628]] and the sword [[H2719]] to those [[H834]] destined for the sword. [[H2719]]

###### 12
I will kindle [[H3341]] a fire [[H784]] in the temples [[H1004]] of the gods [[H430]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] and he will burn [those temples] [[H8313]] and take [their gods] as captives. [[H7617]] So he will wrap [[H5844]] himself with [[H854]] the land [[H776]] of Egypt [[H4714]] as [[H834]] a shepherd [[H7462]] wraps himself [[H5844]] in his garment, [[H899]] and he will depart [[H3318]] from there [[H8033]] unscathed. [[H7965]]

###### 13
He will demolish [[H7665]] the sacred pillars [[H4676]] of the temple of the sun [[H1053]] in Egypt, [[H4714]] and [[H853]] he will burn down [[H8313]] the temples [[H1004]] of the gods [[H430]] of Egypt.” [[H4714]]
