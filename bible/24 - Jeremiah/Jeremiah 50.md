### 1
[This is] the word [[H1697]] that [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] spoke [[H1696]] through [[H3027]] Jeremiah [[H3414]] the prophet [[H5030]] concerning [[H413]] Babylon [[H894]] and [[H413]] the land [[H776]] of the Chaldeans: [[H3778]]

### 2
“Announce [[H5046]] and declare [[H8085]] to the nations; [[H1471]] lift up [[H5375]] a banner [[H5251]] and proclaim it; [[H8085]] hold [[H3582]] nothing back [[H408]] when you say, [[H559]] ‘Babylon [[H894]] is captured; [[H3920]] Bel [[H1078]] is put to shame; [[H3001]] Marduk [[H4781]] is shattered, [[H2865]] her images [[H6091]] are disgraced, [[H3001]] her idols [[H1544]] are broken in pieces.’ [[H2865]]

### 3
For [[H3588]] a nation [[H1471]] from the north [[H6828]] will come [[H5927]] against her; [[H5921]] it [[H1931]] will make [[H7896]] her land [[H776]] an object of horror. [[H8047]] No one [[H3808]] will live [[H3427]] in it;  both man [[H120]] and [[H5704]] beast [[H929]] will flee.” [[H5110]]

### 4
“In those [[H1992]] days [[H3117]] and at that [[H1931]] time, [[H6256]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD, [[H3069]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] and the children [[H1121]] of Judah [[H3063]] will come [[H935]] together, [[H3162]] weeping [[H1058]] as they come, [[H1980]] and will seek [[H1245]] the LORD [[H3069]] their God. [[H430]]

### 5
They will ask [[H7592]] the way [[H1870]] to Zion [[H6726]] [and turn] their faces [[H6440]] toward it. [[H2008]] They will come [[H935]] and join [[H3867]] themselves to [[H413]] the LORD [[H3068]] in an everlasting [[H5769]] covenant [[H1285]] that will never [[H3808]] be forgotten. [[H7911]]

### 6
My people [[H5971]] are [[H1961]] lost [[H6]] sheep; [[H6629]] their shepherds [[H7462]] have led them astray, [[H8582]] causing them to roam [[H7726]] the mountains. [[H2022]] They have wandered [[H1980]] from mountain [[H2022]] to [[H413]] hill; [[H1389]] they have forgotten [[H7911]] their resting place. [[H7258]]

### 7
All [[H3605]] who found them [[H4672]] devoured them, [[H398]] and their enemies [[H6862]] said, [[H559]] ‘We are not [[H3808]] guilty, [[H816]] for [[H8478]] they have sinned [[H2398]] against the LORD, [[H3068]] the habitation [[H5116]] of righteousness, [[H6664]] the LORD, [[H3068]] the hope [[H4723]] of their fathers.’ [[H1]]

### 8
Flee [[H5110]] from the midst [[H8432]] of Babylon; [[H894]] depart [[H3318]] from the land [[H776]] of the Chaldeans; [[H3778]] be [[H1961]] like the he-goats [[H6260]] that lead [[H6440]] the flock. [[H6629]]

### 9
For [[H3588]] behold, [[H2009]] I [[H595]] stir up [[H5782]] and bring [[H5927]] against [[H5921]] Babylon [[H894]] an assembly [[H6951]] of great [[H1419]] nations [[H1471]] from the land [[H776]] of the north. [[H6828]] They will line up [[H6186]] against her;  from [the north] [[H8033]] she will be captured. [[H3920]] Their arrows [[H2671]] will be like skilled [[H7919]] warriors [[H1368]] who do not [[H3808]] return [[H7725]] empty-handed. [[H7387]]

### 10
Chaldea [[H3778]] will be [[H1961]] plundered; [[H7998]] all [[H3605]] who plunder her [[H7997]] will have their fill,” [[H7646]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD. [[H3068]]

### 11
“Because [[H3588]] you rejoice, [[H8055]] because [[H3588]] you sing in triumph— [[H5937]] you who plunder [[H8154]] My inheritance— [[H5159]] because [[H3588]] you frolic [[H6335]] like a heifer [[H5697]] treading grain [[H1877]] and neigh [[H6670]] like stallions, [[H47]]

### 12
your mother [[H517]] will be greatly [[H3966]] ashamed; [[H954]] she who bore you [[H3205]] will be disgraced. [[H2659]] Behold, [[H2009]] [she will be] the least [[H319]] of the nations, [[H1471]] a wilderness, [[H4057]] a dry land, [[H6723]] and a desert. [[H6160]]

### 13
Because of the wrath [[H7110]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] she will not [[H3808]] be inhabited; [[H3427]] she will become [[H1961]] completely [[H3605]] desolate. [[H8077]] All [[H3605]] who pass [[H5674]] through [[H5921]] Babylon [[H894]] will be horrified [[H8074]] and scoff [[H8319]] at [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] her wounds. [[H4347]]

### 14
Line up in formation [[H6186]] around [[H5439]] Babylon, [[H894]] all [[H3605]] you who draw [[H1869]] the bow! [[H7198]] Shoot [[H3034]] at her! [[H413]] Spare [[H2550]] no [[H408]] arrows! [[H2671]] For [[H3588]] she has sinned [[H2398]] against the LORD. [[H3068]]

### 15
Raise a war cry [[H7321]] against [[H5921]] her on every side! [[H5439]] She has thrown up [[H5414]] her hands in surrender; [[H3027]] her towers [[H803]] have fallen; [[H5307]] her walls [[H2346]] are torn down. [[H2040]] Since [[H3588]] this [[H1931]] is the vengeance [[H5360]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] take out your vengeance upon her; [[H5358]] as [[H834]] she has done, [[H6213]] do the same [[H6213]] to her. 

### 16
Cut off [[H3772]] the sower [[H2232]] from Babylon, [[H894]] and the one who wields [[H8610]] the sickle [[H4038]] at harvest [[H7105]] time. [[H6256]] In the face of [[H6440]] the oppressor’s [[H3238]] sword, [[H2719]] each [[H376]] will turn [[H6437]] to [[H413]] his own people, [[H5971]] each [[H376]] will flee [[H5127]] to his own land. [[H776]]

### 17
Israel [[H3478]] is a scattered [[H6340]] flock, [[H7716]] chased away [[H5080]] by lions. [[H738]] The first [[H7223]] to devour him [[H398]] was the king [[H4428]] of Assyria; [[H804]] the last [[H314]] to crush his bones [[H6105]] was Nebuchadnezzar [[H5019]] king [[H4428]] of Babylon.” [[H894]]

### 18
Therefore, [[H3651]] this is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts, [[H6635]] the God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] says: [[H559]] “I will punish [[H6485]] the king [[H4428]] of Babylon [[H894]] and his land [[H776]] as [[H834]] I punished [[H6485]] the king [[H4428]] of Assyria. [[H804]]

### 19
I will return [[H7725]] Israel [[H3478]] to [[H413]] his pasture, [[H5116]] and he will graze [[H7462]] on Carmel [[H3760]] and Bashan; [[H1316]] his soul [[H5315]] will be satisfied [[H7646]] on the hills [[H2022]] of Ephraim [[H669]] and Gilead. [[H1568]]

### 20
In those [[H1992]] days [[H3117]] and at that [[H1931]] time, [[H6256]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD, [[H3068]] a search will transpire [[H1245]] for Israel’s [[H3478]] guilt, [[H5771]] but there will be none, [[H369]] and for Judah’s [[H3063]] sins, [[H2403]] but they will not [[H3808]] be found; [[H4672]] for [[H3588]] I will forgive [[H5545]] the remnant I spare.” [[H7604]]

### 21
“Go up [[H5927]] against [[H5921]] the land [[H776]] of Merathaim, [[H4850]] and against [[H413]] the residents [[H3427]] of Pekod. [[H6489]] Put them to the sword [[H2717]] and completely destroy [[H2763]] them,” [[H310]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD. [[H3068]] “Do [[H6213]] everything [[H3605]] I have commanded you. [[H6680]]

### 22
The noise [[H6963]] of battle [[H4421]] is in the land— [[H776]] [the noise] of great [[H1419]] destruction. [[H7667]]

### 23
How [[H349]] the hammer [[H6360]] of the whole [[H3605]] earth [[H776]] lies broken [[H1438]] and shattered! [[H7665]] What [[H349]] a horror [[H8047]] Babylon [[H894]] has become [[H1961]] among the nations! [[H1471]]

### 24
I laid a snare [[H3369]] for you,  O Babylon, [[H894]] and you [[H1571]] were caught [[H3920]] before you [[H859]] knew it. [[H3045]] You were found [[H4672]] and captured [[H8610]] because [[H3588]] you challenged [[H1624]] the LORD. [[H3068]]

### 25
The LORD [[H3068]] has opened [[H6605]] His armory [[H214]] and brought out [[H3318]] His weapons [[H3627]] of wrath, [[H2195]] for [[H3588]] it [[H1931]] [is] the work [[H4399]] of the Lord [[H136]] GOD [[H3069]] of Hosts [[H6635]] in the land [[H776]] of the Chaldeans. [[H3778]]

### 26
Come [[H935]] against her  from the farthest border. [[H7093]] Break open [[H6605]] her granaries; [[H3965]] pile her up [[H5549]] like [[H3644]] mounds of grain. [[H6194]] Completely destroy her; [[H2763]] leave her no [[H408]] survivors. [[H7611]]

### 27
Put all [[H3605]] her young bulls [[H6499]] to the sword; [[H2717]] let them go down [[H3381]] to the slaughter. [[H2874]] Woe [[H1945]] to them, [[H5921]] for [[H3588]] their day [[H3117]] has come— [[H935]] the time [[H6256]] of their punishment. [[H6486]]

### 28
Listen to [[H6963]] the fugitives [[H5127]] and refugees [[H6412]] from the land [[H776]] of Babylon, [[H894]] declaring [[H5046]] in Zion [[H6726]] the vengeance [[H5360]] of the LORD [[H3068]] our God, [[H430]] the vengeance [[H5360]] for His temple. [[H1964]]

### 29
Summon [[H8085]] the archers [[H7228]] against [[H413]] Babylon, [[H894]] all [[H3605]] who string [[H1869]] the bow. [[H7198]] Encamp [[H2583]] all around her; [[H5439]] let no one [[H408]] escape. [[H6413]] Repay [[H7999]] her  according to her deeds; [[H6467]] do [[H6213]] to her  as [[H3605]] she has done. [[H6213]] For [[H3588]] she has defied [[H2102]] the LORD, [[H3068]] the Holy [[H6918]] One of Israel. [[H3478]]

### 30
Therefore, [[H3651]] her young men [[H970]] will fall [[H5307]] in the streets; [[H7339]] all [[H3605]] her soldiers [[H376]] will perish [[H1826]] in that [[H1931]] day,” [[H3117]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD. [[H3068]]

### 31
“Behold, [[H2005]] I am against you, [[H413]] O arrogant one, [[H2087]] declares [[H5002]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD [[H3069]] of Hosts, [[H6635]] because [[H3588]] your day [[H3117]] has come, [[H935]] the time [[H6256]] when I will punish you. [[H6485]]

### 32
The arrogant one [[H2087]] will stumble [[H3782]] and fall [[H5307]] with no [[H369]] one to pick him up. [[H6965]] And I will kindle [[H3341]] a fire [[H784]] in his cities [[H5892]] to consume [[H398]] all those [[H3605]] around him.” [[H5439]]

### 33
This is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts [[H6635]] says: [[H559]] “The sons [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] are oppressed, [[H6231]] and the sons [[H1121]] of Judah [[H3063]] as well. [[H3162]] All [[H3605]] their captors [[H7617]] hold them fast, [[H2388]] refusing [[H3985]] to release them. [[H7971]]

### 34
Their Redeemer [[H1350]] is strong; [[H2389]] the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts [[H6635]] is His name. [[H8034]] He will fervently plead [[H7378]] their case [[H7379]] so that [[H4616]] He may bring rest [[H7280]] to the earth, [[H776]] but turmoil [[H7264]] to those who live [[H3427]] in Babylon. [[H894]]

### 35
A sword [[H2719]] [is] against [[H5921]] the Chaldeans, [[H3778]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD, [[H3068]] against [[H413]] those who live [[H3427]] in Babylon, [[H894]] and against [[H413]] her officials [[H8269]] and [[H413]] wise men. [[H2450]]

### 36
A sword [[H2719]] [is] against [[H413]] her diviners, [[H907]] and they will become fools. [[H2973]] A sword [[H2719]] is against [[H413]] her warriors, [[H1368]] and they will be filled with terror. [[H2865]]

### 37
A sword [[H2719]] is against [[H413]] her horses [[H5483]] and chariots [[H7393]] and against [[H413]] all [[H3605]] the foreigners [[H6154]] in her midst, [[H8432]] and they will become [[H1961]] like women. [[H802]] A sword [[H2719]] is against [[H413]] her treasuries, [[H214]] and they will be plundered. [[H962]]

### 38
A drought [[H2721]] [is] upon [[H413]] her waters, [[H4325]] and they will be dried up. [[H3001]] For [[H3588]] it [[H1931]] is a land [[H776]] of graven images, [[H6456]] and [the people] go mad [[H367]] over idols. [[H1984]]

### 39
So [[H3651]] the desert creatures [[H6728]] and [[H854]] hyenas [[H338]] will live there [[H3427]] and ostriches [[H1323]] will dwell [[H3427]] there.  It will never [[H3808]] again [[H5750]] be inhabited [[H3427]] or settled [[H7931]] from [[H5704]] generation [[H1755]] to generation. [[H1755]]

### 40
As God [[H430]] overthrew [[H4114]] Sodom [[H5467]] and Gomorrah [[H6017]] along with [[H853]] their neighboring towns, [[H7934]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD, [[H3068]] no [[H3808]] one [[H376]] will reside [[H3427]] there; [[H8033]] no [[H3808]] man [[H1121]] will dwell [[H1481]] there. 

### 41
Behold! [[H2009]] A people [[H5971]] comes [[H935]] from the north. [[H6828]] A great [[H1419]] nation [[H1471]] and many [[H7227]] kings [[H4428]] will be stirred up [[H5782]] from the remote regions [[H3411]] of the earth. [[H776]]

### 42
They grasp [[H2388]] the bow [[H7198]] and javelin. [[H3591]] They [[H1992]] are cruel [[H394]] and without [[H3808]] mercy. [[H7355]] Their voice [[H6963]] roars [[H1993]] like the sea, [[H3220]] and they ride [[H7392]] on [[H5921]] horses, [[H5483]] lined up [[H6186]] like men [[H376]] in battle formation [[H4421]] against you, [[H5921]] O Daughter [[H1323]] of Babylon. [[H894]]

### 43
The king [[H4428]] of Babylon [[H894]] has heard [[H8085]] the report, [[H8088]] and his hands [[H3027]] hang limp. [[H7503]] Distress [[H6869]] has seized him, [[H2388]] pain [[H2427]] like that of a woman in labor. [[H3205]]

### 44
Behold, [[H2009]] one will come [[H5927]] like a lion [[H738]] from the thickets [[H1347]] of the Jordan [[H3383]] to [[H413]] the watered pasture. [[H5116]] For [[H3588]] in an instant [[H7280]] I will chase [Babylon] [[H7323]] from her land. [[H5921]] Who [[H4310]] is the chosen one [[H970]] I will appoint [[H6485]] over her? [[H413]] For [[H3588]] who [[H4310]] is like Me, [[H3644]] and who [[H4310]] can challenge Me? [[H3259]] What [[H4310]] shepherd [[H7462]] can stand [[H5975]] against Me? [[H6440]]

### 45
Therefore, [[H3651]] hear [[H8085]] the plans [[H6098]] that [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] has drawn up [[H3289]] against [[H413]] Babylon [[H894]] and the strategies [[H4284]] He has devised [[H2803]] against [[H413]] the land [[H776]] of the Chaldeans: [[H3778]] Surely [[H518]] the little ones [[H6810]] of the flock [[H6629]] will be dragged away; [[H5498]] certainly [[H518]] their pasture [[H5116]] will be made desolate [[H8074]] because of them. [[H5921]]

### 46
At the sound [[H6963]] of Babylon’s [[H894]] capture [[H8610]] the earth [[H776]] will quake; [[H7493]] a cry [[H2201]] will be heard [[H8085]] among the nations. [[H1471]]
