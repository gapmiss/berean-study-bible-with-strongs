###### 1
This is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] says: [[H559]] “Behold, [[H2005]] I will stir up [[H5782]] against [[H5921]] Babylon [[H894]] and against [[H413]] the people [[H3427]] of Leb-kamai [[H3820]] the spirit [[H7307]] of a destroyer. [[H7843]]

###### 2
I will send [[H7971]] strangers [[H2114]] to Babylon [[H894]] to winnow her [[H2219]] and empty [[H1238]] her [[H853]] land; [[H776]] for [[H3588]] they will come [[H1961]] against her [[H5921]] from every side [[H5439]] in the day [[H3117]] of [her] disaster. [[H7451]]

###### 3
Do not let the archer [[H1869]] bend [[H1869]] his bow [[H7198]] [or] [[H5927]] put on his armor. [[H5630]] Do not [[H408]] spare [[H2550]] her young men; [[H970]] completely destroy [[H2763]] her [[H3605]] army! [[H6635]]

###### 4
And they will fall [[H5307]] slain [[H2491]] in the land [[H776]] of the Chaldeans, [[H3778]] and pierced through [[H1856]] in her streets. [[H2351]]

###### 5
For [[H3588]] Israel [[H3478]] and Judah [[H3063]] have not [[H3808]] been abandoned [[H488]] by their God, [[H430]] the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts, [[H6635]] though [[H3588]] their land [[H776]] is full of [[H4390]] guilt [[H817]] before the Holy [[H6918]] One of Israel.” [[H3478]]

###### 6
Flee [[H5127]] from [[H8432]] Babylon; [[H894]] escape [[H4422]] with your [[H376]] lives! [[H5315]] Do not [[H408]] be destroyed [[H1826]] in her punishment. [[H5771]] For [[H3588]] this [[H1931]] is the time [[H6256]] of the LORD’s [[H3068]] vengeance; [[H5360]] He [[H1931]] will pay [[H7999]] her  what she deserves. [[H1576]]

###### 7
Babylon [[H894]] was a gold [[H2091]] cup [[H3563]] in the hand [[H3027]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] making the whole [[H3605]] earth [[H776]] drunk. [[H7937]] The nations [[H1471]] drank [[H8354]] her wine; [[H3196]] therefore [[H5921]] the nations [[H1471]] have gone mad. [[H1984]]

###### 8
Suddenly [[H6597]] Babylon [[H894]] has fallen [[H5307]] and been shattered. [[H7665]] Wail [[H3213]] for her; [[H5921]] get her [[H3947]] balm [[H6875]] for her pain; [[H4341]] perhaps [[H194]] she can be healed. [[H7495]]

###### 9
“We tried to heal [[H7495]] Babylon, [[H894]] but she could not [[H3808]] be healed. [[H7495]] Abandon her! [[H5800]] Let each [[H376]] of us go [[H1980]] to his own land, [[H776]] for [[H3588]] her judgment [[H4941]] extends [[H5060]] to [[H413]] the sky [[H8064]] and reaches [[H5375]] to [[H5704]] the clouds.” [[H7834]]

###### 10
The LORD [[H3069]] has brought forth [[H3318]] our vindication; [[H6666]] come, [[H935]] let us tell [[H5608]] in Zion [[H6726]] what the LORD [[H3069]] our God [[H430]] has accomplished. [[H4639]]

###### 11
Sharpen [[H1305]] the arrows! [[H2671]] Take up [[H4390]] the shields! [[H7982]] The LORD [[H3068]] has aroused [[H5782]] the spirit [[H7307]] of the kings [[H4428]] of the Medes, [[H4074]] because [[H3588]] His plan [[H4209]] is aimed at [[H5921]] Babylon [[H894]] to destroy her, [[H7843]] for [[H3588]] it [[H1931]] [is] the vengeance [[H5360]] of the LORD— [[H3068]] vengeance [[H5360]] for His temple. [[H1964]]

###### 12
Raise [[H5375]] a banner [[H5251]] against [[H413]] the walls [[H2346]] of Babylon; [[H894]] post [[H2388]] the guard; [[H4929]] station [[H6965]] the watchmen; [[H8104]] prepare [[H3559]] the ambush. [[H693]] For [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] has both [[H1571]] devised [[H2161]] and [[H1571]] accomplished [[H6213]] what [[H834]] He spoke [[H1696]] against [[H413]] the people [[H3427]] of Babylon. [[H894]]

###### 13
You who dwell [[H7931]] by [[H5921]] many [[H7227]] waters, [[H4325]] rich [[H7227]] in treasures, [[H214]] your end [[H7093]] has come, [[H935]] the thread of your life [[H520]] is cut. [[H1215]]

###### 14
The LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts [[H6635]] has sworn [[H7650]] by Himself: [[H5315]] “Surely [[H3588]] I will fill you up [[H4390]] with men [[H120]] like locusts, [[H3218]] and they will shout in triumph [[H6030]] over you.” [[H5921]]

###### 15
He made [[H6213]] the earth [[H776]] by His power; [[H3581]] He established [[H3559]] the world [[H8398]] by His wisdom [[H2451]] and stretched out [[H5186]] the heavens [[H8064]] by His understanding. [[H8394]]

###### 16
When He thunders, [[H6963]] the waters [[H4325]] in the heavens [[H8064]] roar, [[H1995]] and He causes the clouds [[H5387]] to rise [[H5927]] from the ends [[H7097]] of the earth. [[H776]] He makes [[H6213]] lightning [[H1300]] for the rain [[H4306]] and brings forth [[H3318]] the wind [[H7307]] from His storehouses. [[H214]]

###### 17
Every [[H3605]] man [[H120]] is senseless [[H1197]] and devoid of knowledge. [[H1847]] Every [[H3605]] goldsmith [[H6884]] is put to shame [[H3001]] by his idols, [[H6459]] for [[H3588]] his molten images [[H5262]] are a lie, [[H8267]] and [there is] no [[H3808]] breath [[H7307]] in them. 

###### 18
They [[H1992]] are worthless, [[H1892]] a work [[H4639]] to be mocked. [[H8595]] In the time [[H6256]] of their punishment [[H6486]] they will perish. [[H6]]

###### 19
Jacob’s [[H3290]] Portion [[H2506]] is not [[H3808]] like these, [[H428]] for [[H3588]] He [[H1931]] is the Maker [[H3335]] of all things, [[H3605]] and of the tribe [[H7626]] of His inheritance— [[H5159]] the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts [[H6635]] is His name. [[H8034]]

###### 20
“You [[H859]] are My war club, [[H4661]] My weapon [[H3627]] for battle. [[H4421]] With you I shatter [[H5310]] nations; [[H1471]] with you I bring kingdoms [[H4467]] to ruin. [[H7843]]

###### 21
With you I shatter [[H5310]] the horse [[H5483]] and rider; [[H7392]] with you I shatter [[H5310]] the chariot [[H7393]] and driver. [[H7392]]

###### 22
With you I shatter [[H5310]] man [[H376]] and woman; [[H802]] with you I shatter [[H5310]] the old man [[H2205]] and the youth; [[H5288]] with you I shatter [[H5310]] the young man [[H970]] and the maiden. [[H1330]]

###### 23
With you I shatter [[H5310]] the shepherd [[H7462]] and his flock; [[H5739]] with you I shatter [[H5310]] the farmer [[H406]] and his oxen; [[H6776]] with you I shatter [[H5310]] the governors [[H6346]] and officials. [[H5461]]

###### 24
Before your very eyes [[H5869]] I will repay [[H7999]] Babylon [[H894]] and all [[H3605]] the residents [[H3427]] of Chaldea [[H3778]] for all [[H3605]] the evil [[H7451]] they have done [[H6213]] in Zion,” [[H6726]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD. [[H3068]]

###### 25
“Behold, [[H2005]] I am against you, [[H413]] O destroying [[H4889]] mountain, [[H2022]] you who devastate [[H7843]] the whole [[H3605]] earth, [[H776]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD. [[H3068]] I will stretch out [[H5186]] My hand [[H3027]] against you; [[H5921]] I will roll you [[H1556]] over [[H4480]] the cliffs, [[H5553]] and turn you [[H5414]] into a charred [[H8316]] mountain. [[H2022]]

###### 26
No one [[H3808]] shall retrieve [[H3947]] from you [[H4480]] a cornerstone [[H68]] or a foundation [[H4146]] stone, [[H68]] because [[H3588]] you will become [[H1961]] desolate [[H8077]] forever,” [[H5769]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD. [[H3068]]

###### 27
“Raise [[H5375]] a banner [[H5251]] in the land! [[H776]] Blow [[H8628]] the trumpet [[H7782]] among the nations! [[H1471]] Prepare [[H6942]] the nations [[H1471]] against her. [[H5921]] Summon [[H8085]] the kingdoms [[H4467]] against her— [[H5921]] Ararat, [[H780]] Minni, [[H4508]] and Ashkenaz. [[H813]] Appoint [[H6485]] a captain [[H2951]] against her; [[H5921]] bring up [[H5927]] horses [[H5483]] like swarming [[H5569]] locusts. [[H3218]]

###### 28
Prepare [[H6942]] the nations [[H1471]] for battle against her— [[H5921]] the kings [[H4428]] of the Medes, [[H4074]] their governors [[H6346]] and all [[H3605]] their officials, [[H5461]] and all [[H3605]] the lands [[H776]] they rule. [[H4475]]

###### 29
The earth [[H776]] quakes [[H7493]] and writhes [[H2342]] because [[H3588]] the LORD’s [[H3068]] intentions [[H4284]] against [[H5921]] Babylon [[H894]] stand: [[H6965]] to make [[H7760]] the land [[H776]] of Babylon [[H894]] a desolation, [[H8047]] without an inhabitant. [[H3427]]

###### 30
The warriors [[H1368]] of Babylon [[H894]] have stopped [[H2308]] fighting; [[H3898]] they sit [[H3427]] in their strongholds. [[H4679]] Their strength [[H1369]] is exhausted; [[H5405]] they have become [[H1961]] like women. [[H802]] Babylon’s homes [[H4908]] have been set ablaze, [[H3341]] the bars of her gates [[H1280]] are broken. [[H7665]]

###### 31
One courier [[H7323]] races [[H7323]] to meet [[H7125]] another, [[H7323]] and messenger [[H5046]] follows [[H7125]] messenger, [[H5046]] to announce [[H5046]] to the king [[H4428]] of Babylon [[H894]] that [[H3588]] his city [[H5892]] has been captured [[H3920]] from end to end. [[H7097]]

###### 32
The fords [[H4569]] have been seized, [[H8610]] the marshes [[H98]] set on fire, [[H8313]] and the soldiers [[H376]] are terrified.” [[H926]]

###### 33
For [[H3588]] this is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts, [[H6635]] the God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] says: [[H559]] “The Daughter [[H1323]] Babylon [[H894]] is like a threshing floor [[H1637]] at the time [[H6256]] it is trampled. [[H1869]] In just a little while [[H5750]] her harvest [[H7105]] time [[H6256]] will come.” [[H935]]

###### 34
“Nebuchadnezzar [[H5019]] king [[H4428]] of Babylon [[H894]] has devoured me; [[H398]] he has crushed me. [[H2000]] He has set me aside [[H3322]] like an empty [[H7385]] vessel; [[H3627]] he has swallowed me [[H1104]] like a monster; [[H8577]] he filled [[H4390]] his belly [[H3770]] with my delicacies [[H5730]] [and] vomited me out. [[H1740]]

###### 35
May the violence done to me [[H2555]] and to my flesh [[H7607]] be upon [[H5921]] Babylon,” [[H894]] says [[H559]] the inhabitant [[H3427]] of Zion. [[H6726]] “May my blood [[H1818]] be on [[H413]] the inhabitants [[H3427]] of Chaldea,” [[H3778]] says [[H559]] Jerusalem. [[H3389]]

###### 36
Therefore, [[H3651]] this is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] says: [[H559]] “Behold, [[H2005]] I will plead [[H7378]] your case [[H7379]] and take vengeance [[H5358]] on your behalf; [[H5360]] I will dry up [[H2717]] her sea [[H3220]] and make her springs [[H4726]] run dry. [[H3001]]

###### 37
Babylon [[H894]] will become [[H1961]] a heap of rubble, [[H1530]] a haunt [[H4583]] of jackals, [[H8577]] an object of horror [[H8047]] and scorn, [[H8322]] without [[H369]] inhabitant. [[H3427]]

###### 38
They will roar [[H7580]] together [[H3162]] like young lions; [[H3715]] they will growl [[H5286]] like lion [[H738]] cubs. [[H1484]]

###### 39
While they are flushed with heat, [[H2527]] I will serve [[H7896]] them a feast, [[H4960]] and I will make them drunk [[H7937]] so that [[H4616]] they may revel; [[H5937]] then they will fall asleep [[H3462]] forever [[H5769]] and never [[H3808]] wake up, [[H6974]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD. [[H3068]]

###### 40
I will bring them down [[H3381]] like lambs [[H3733]] to the slaughter, [[H2873]] like rams [[H352]] with [[H5973]] male goats.” [[H6260]]

###### 41
How [[H349]] Sheshach [[H8347]] has been captured! [[H3920]] The praise [[H8416]] of the whole [[H3605]] earth [[H776]] has been seized. [[H8610]] What [[H349]] a horror [[H8047]] Babylon [[H894]] has become [[H1961]] among the nations! [[H1471]]

###### 42
The sea [[H3220]] has come up [[H5927]] over [[H5921]] Babylon; [[H894]] she is covered [[H3680]] in turbulent [[H1995]] waves. [[H1530]]

###### 43
Her cities [[H5892]] have become [[H1961]] a desolation, [[H8047]] a dry [[H6723]] and arid [[H6160]] land, [[H776]] a land [[H776]] where no [[H3808]] one [[H376]] lives, [[H3427]] where no [[H3808]] son [[H1121]] of man [[H120]] passes through. [[H5674]]

###### 44
I will punish [[H6485]] Bel [[H1078]] in Babylon. [[H894]] I will make him spew out [[H3318]] what he swallowed. [[H1105]] The nations [[H1471]] will no [[H3808]] longer [[H5750]] stream [[H5102]] to him; [[H413]] even [[H1571]] the wall [[H2346]] of Babylon [[H894]] will fall. [[H5307]]

###### 45
Come out [[H3318]] from among her, [[H8432]] My people! [[H5971]] Save [[H4422]] your lives, [[H5315]] each of you, [[H376]] from the fierce [[H2740]] anger [[H639]] of the LORD. [[H3068]]

###### 46
Do not [[H6435]] let your heart [[H3824]] grow faint, [[H7401]] and do not be afraid [[H3372]] when the rumor [[H8052]] is heard [[H8085]] in the land; [[H776]] for a rumor [[H8052]] will come [[H935]] one year, [[H8141]] and then [[H310]] another [[H8052]] the next year [[H8141]] of violence [[H2555]] in the land [[H776]] and ruler [[H4910]] against [[H5921]] ruler. [[H4910]]

###### 47
Therefore, [[H3651]] behold, [[H2009]] the days [[H3117]] are coming [[H935]] when I will punish [[H6485]] the idols [[H6456]] of Babylon. [[H894]] Her entire [[H3605]] land [[H776]] will suffer shame, [[H954]] and all [[H3605]] her slain [[H2491]] will lie fallen [[H5307]] within her. [[H8432]]

###### 48
Then heaven [[H8064]] and earth [[H776]] and all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] is in them  will shout for joy [[H7442]] over [[H5921]] Babylon [[H894]] because [[H3588]] the destroyers [[H7703]] from the north [[H6828]] will come against her,” [[H935]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD. [[H3068]]

###### 49
Babylon [[H894]] must fall [[H5307]] on account of the slain [[H2491]] of Israel, [[H3478]] just as [[H1571]] the slain [[H2491]] of all [[H3605]] the earth [[H776]] have fallen [[H5307]] because of Babylon. [[H894]]

###### 50
You who have escaped [[H6412]] the sword, [[H2719]] depart [[H1980]] and do not [[H408]] linger! [[H5975]] Remember [[H2142]] the LORD [[H3068]] from far away, [[H7350]] and let Jerusalem [[H3389]] come [[H5927]] to [[H5921]] mind. [[H3824]]

###### 51
“We are ashamed [[H954]] because [[H3588]] we have heard [[H8085]] reproach; [[H2781]] disgrace [[H3639]] has covered [[H3680]] our faces, [[H6440]] because [[H3588]] foreigners [[H2114]] have entered [[H935]] the holy places [[H4720]] of the LORD’s [[H3068]] house.” [[H1004]]

###### 52
“Therefore, [[H3651]] behold, [[H2009]] the days [[H3117]] are coming,” [[H935]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD, [[H3068]] “when I will punish [[H6485]] her idols, [[H6456]] and throughout [[H3605]] her land [[H776]] the wounded [[H2491]] will groan. [[H602]]

###### 53
Even if [[H3588]] Babylon [[H894]] should ascend [[H5927]] to the heavens [[H8064]] and fortify [[H1219]] her lofty [[H4791]] stronghold, [[H5797]] the destroyers [[H7703]] I send [[H854]] will come [[H935]] against her,  declares [[H5002]] the LORD. [[H3068]]

###### 54
The sound [[H6963]] of a cry [[H2201]] [comes from] Babylon, [[H894]] the sound of great [[H1419]] destruction [[H7667]] from the land [[H776]] of the Chaldeans! [[H3778]]

###### 55
For [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] will destroy [[H7703]] Babylon; [[H894]] He will silence [[H6]] her mighty [[H1419]] voice. [[H6963]] The waves [[H1530]] will roar [[H1993]] like great [[H7227]] waters; [[H4325]] the tumult [[H7588]] of their voice [[H6963]] will resound. [[H5414]]

###### 56
For [[H3588]] a destroyer [[H7703]] is coming [[H935]] against her— [[H5921]] against [[H5921]] Babylon. [[H894]] Her warriors [[H1368]] will be captured, [[H3920]] [and] their bows [[H7198]] will be broken, [[H2865]] for [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] is a God [[H410]] of retribution; [[H1578]] He will repay in full. [[H7999]]

###### 57
I will make her princes [[H8269]] and wise men [[H2450]] drunk, [[H7937]] along with her governors, [[H6346]] officials, [[H5461]] and warriors. [[H1368]] Then they will fall asleep [[H3462]] forever [[H5769]] and not [[H3808]] wake up,” [[H6974]] declares [[H5002]] the King, [[H4428]] whose name [[H8034]] is the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts. [[H6635]]

###### 58
This is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts [[H6635]] says: [[H559]] “Babylon’s [[H894]] thick [[H7342]] walls [[H2346]] will be leveled, [[H6209]] and her high [[H1364]] gates [[H8179]] consumed [[H3341]] by fire. [[H784]] So the labor [[H3021]] of the people [[H5971]] will be for nothing; [[H7385]] the nations [[H3816]] will exhaust themselves [[H3286]] to fuel the flames.” [[H784]]

###### 59
[This is] the command [[H1697]] that [[H834]] Jeremiah [[H3414]] the prophet [[H5030]] gave [[H6680]] to the quartermaster [[H8269]] Seraiah [[H8304]] son [[H1121]] of Neriah, [[H5374]] the son [[H1121]] of Mahseiah, [[H4271]] when he went [[H1980]] to Babylon [[H894]] with [[H854]] King [[H4428]] Zedekiah [[H6667]] of Judah [[H3063]] in the fourth [[H7243]] year [[H8141]] of Zedekiah’s reign. [[H4427]]

###### 60
Jeremiah [[H3414]] had written [[H3789]] on [[H413]] a single [[H259]] scroll [[H5612]] about all [[H3605]] the disaster [[H7451]] that [[H834]] would come [[H935]] upon [[H413]] Babylon— [[H894]] all [[H3605]] these [[H428]] words [[H1697]] that had been written [[H3789]] concerning [[H413]] Babylon. [[H894]]

###### 61
And Jeremiah [[H3414]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Seraiah, [[H8304]] “When you get [[H935]] to Babylon, [[H894]] see [[H7200]] that you read all [[H3605]] these [[H428]] words [[H1697]] aloud, [[H7121]]

###### 62
and say, [[H559]] ‘O LORD, [[H3068]] You [[H859]] have promised [[H1696]] to cut off [[H3772]] this [[H2088]] place [[H4725]] so that no one [[H1115]] will remain— [[H3427]] neither man [[H120]] nor [[H5704]] beast. [[H929]] Indeed, [[H3588]] it will be [[H1961]] desolate [[H8077]] forever.’ [[H5769]]

###### 63
When you finish [[H3615]] reading [[H7121]] this [[H2088]] scroll, [[H5612]] tie [[H7194]] a stone [[H68]] to it [[H5921]] and cast it [[H7993]] into [[H413]] the Euphrates. [[H6578]]

###### 64
Then you are to say, [[H559]] ‘In the same way, [[H3602]] Babylon [[H894]] will sink [[H8257]] and never [[H3808]] rise again, [[H6965]] because of [[H6440]] the disaster [[H7451]] I [[H595]] will bring [[H935]] upon her. [[H5921]] And [her people] will grow weary.’” [[H3286]] Here [[H2008]] end [[H5704]] the words [[H1697]] of Jeremiah. [[H3414]]
