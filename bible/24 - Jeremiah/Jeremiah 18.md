###### 1
This is the word [[H1697]] that [[H834]] came [[H1961]] to [[H413]] Jeremiah [[H3414]] from the LORD: [[H3068]]

###### 2
“Go down [[H3381]] at once [[H6965]] to the potter’s [[H3335]] house, [[H1004]] and there [[H8033]] I will reveal [[H8085]] My message to you.” [[H1697]]

###### 3
So I went down [[H3381]] to the potter’s [[H3335]] house [[H1004]] and saw [[H2009]] him working [[H6213]] at [[H5921]] the wheel. [[H70]]

###### 4
But the vessel [[H3627]] that [[H834]] he [[H1931]] was shaping [[H6213]] from the clay [[H2563]] became flawed [[H7843]] in [his] [[H3335]] hand; [[H3027]] so he formed [[H6213]] it into another [[H312]] vessel, [[H3627]] as [[H834]] it seemed [[H5869]] best [[H3474]] for him [[H3335]] to do. [[H6213]]

###### 5
Then the word [[H1697]] of the LORD [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] to me, [[H413]] saying, [[H559]]

###### 6
“O house [[H1004]] of Israel, [[H3478]] can [[H3201]] I not [[H3808]] treat [[H6213]] you  as this [[H2088]] potter treats his clay? [[H3335]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD. [[H3068]] Just like clay [[H2563]] in the potter’s [[H3335]] hand, [[H3027]] so [[H3651]] are you [[H859]] in My hand, [[H3027]] O house [[H1004]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

###### 7
At any time [[H7281]] I might announce [[H1696]] that [[H5921]] a nation [[H1471]] or kingdom [[H4467]] will be uprooted, [[H5428]] torn down, [[H5422]] and destroyed. [[H6]]

###### 8
But if that [[H1931]] nation [[H1471]] I warned [[H1696]] turns [[H7725]] from its evil, [[H7451]] then I will relent [[H5162]] of [[H5921]] the disaster [[H7451]] I had planned [[H2803]] to inflict. [[H6213]]

###### 9
And if at another time [[H7281]] I announce [[H1696]] that I will build up [[H1129]] and establish [[H5193]] a nation [[H1471]] or kingdom, [[H4467]]

###### 10
and if it does [[H6213]] evil [[H7451]] in My sight [[H5869]] and does not [[H1115]] listen [[H8085]] to My voice, [[H6963]] I will relent [[H5162]] of [[H5921]] the good [[H2896]] I had intended for it. [[H559]]

###### 11
Now therefore, [[H6258]] tell [[H559]] the men [[H376]] of Judah [[H3063]] and [[H5921]] residents [[H3427]] of Jerusalem [[H3389]] that this is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] says: [[H559]] ‘Behold, [[H2009]] I [[H595]] am planning [[H3335]] a disaster [[H7451]] for you [[H5921]] and devising [[H2803]] a plan [[H4284]] against you. [[H5921]] Turn [[H7725]] now, [[H4994]] each of you, [[H376]] from your evil [[H7451]] ways, [[H1870]] and correct [[H3190]] your ways [[H1870]] and deeds. [[H4611]]

###### 12
But they will reply, [[H559]] ‘It is hopeless. [[H2976]] We will follow [[H1980]] our own plans, [[H4284]] and each of us [[H376]] will act [[H6213]] according to the stubbornness [[H8307]] of his evil [[H7451]] heart.’” [[H3820]]

###### 13
Therefore, [[H3651]] this is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] says: [[H559]] “Inquire [[H7592]] among the nations: [[H1471]] Who [[H4310]] has ever heard [[H8085]] things like these? [[H428]] Virgin [[H1330]] Israel [[H3478]] has done [[H6213]] a most [[H3966]] terrible thing. [[H8186]]

###### 14
Does the snow [[H7950]] of Lebanon [[H3844]] ever leave [[H5800]] its rocky [[H6697]] slopes? [[H7704]] Or [[H518]] do its cool [[H7119]] waters [[H4325]] flowing [[H5140]] from a distance [[H2114]] ever run dry? [[H5428]]

###### 15
Yet [[H3588]] My people [[H5971]] have forgotten Me. [[H7911]] They burn incense [[H6999]] to worthless idols [[H7723]] that make them stumble [[H3782]] in their ways [[H1870]] on the ancient [[H5769]] roads [[H7635]] and walk [[H1980]] on bypaths [[H5410]] instead of [[H3808]] the highway. [[H5549]]

###### 16
They have made [[H7760]] their land [[H776]] a desolation, [[H8047]] a perpetual [[H5769]] object of scorn; [[H8292]] everyone [[H3605]] who passes [[H5674]] by [[H5921]] will be appalled [[H8074]] and shake [[H5110]] their heads. [[H7218]]

###### 17
I will scatter them [[H6327]] before [[H6440]] the enemy [[H341]] like the east [[H6921]] wind. [[H7307]] I will show [[H7200]] them My back [[H6203]] and not [[H3808]] My face [[H6440]] in the day [[H3117]] of their calamity.” [[H343]]

###### 18
Then [some] said, [[H559]] “Come, [[H1980]] let us make plans [[H2803]] against [[H5921]] Jeremiah, [[H3414]] for [[H3588]] the law [[H8451]] will never [[H3808]] be lost [[H6]] to the priest, [[H3548]] or counsel [[H6098]] to the wise, [[H2450]] or an oracle [[H1697]] to the prophet. [[H5030]] Come, [[H1980]] let us denounce [[H5221]] him and pay no [[H408]] heed [[H7181]] to [[H413]] any [[H3605]] of his words. [[H1697]]

###### 19
Give heed [[H7181]] to me, [[H413]] O LORD. [[H3068]] Hear [[H8085]] what my accusers [[H3401]] are saying! [[H6963]]

###### 20
Should good [[H2896]] be repaid [[H7999]] with [[H8478]] evil? [[H7451]] Yet [[H3588]] they have dug [[H3738]] a pit [[H7745]] for me. [[H5315]] Remember [[H2142]] how I stood [[H5975]] before You [[H6440]] to speak [[H1696]] good [[H2896]] on their behalf, [[H5921]] to turn [[H7725]] Your wrath [[H2534]] from them. [[H1992]]

###### 21
Therefore, [[H3651]] hand their children [[H1121]] over [[H5414]] to famine, [[H7458]] pour out [[H5064]] the power [[H3027]] of the sword [[H2719]] upon them. [[H5921]] Let their wives [[H802]] become [[H1961]] childless [[H7909]] and widowed, [[H490]] their husbands [[H376]] be slain [[H2026]] by disease, [[H4194]] and their young men [[H970]] struck down [[H5221]] by the sword [[H2719]] in battle. [[H4421]]

###### 22
Let a cry [[H2201]] be heard [[H8085]] from their houses [[H1004]] when [[H3588]] You suddenly [[H6597]] bring [[H935]] raiders [[H1416]] against them, [[H5921]] for [[H3588]] they have dug [[H3738]] a pit [[H7882]] to capture me [[H3920]] and have hidden [[H2934]] snares [[H6341]] for my feet. [[H7272]]

###### 23
But You, [[H859]] O LORD, [[H3068]] know [[H3045]] all [[H3605]] their deadly [[H4194]] plots [[H6098]] against me. [[H5921]] Do not [[H408]] wipe out [[H3722]] their guilt [[H5771]] [or] [[H408]] blot out [[H4229]] their sin [[H2403]] from Your sight. [[H6440]] Let them be overthrown [[H3782]] before You; [[H6440]] deal [[H6213]] with them  in the time [[H6256]] of Your anger. [[H639]]
