[[Isaiah 66|←]] • [[Jeremiah 2|→]]

###### 1
[These are] the words [[H1697]] of Jeremiah [[H3414]] son [[H1121]] of Hilkiah, [[H2518]] one of [[H4480]] the priests [[H3548]] in Anathoth [[H6068]] in the territory [[H776]] of Benjamin. [[H1144]]

###### 2
The word [[H1697]] of the LORD [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] to [Jeremiah] [[H413]] in the thirteenth [[H7969]] year [[H8141]] of the reign [[H4427]] of Josiah [[H2977]] son [[H1121]] of Amon [[H526]] king [[H4428]] of Judah, [[H3063]]

###### 3
and [[H1961]] through the days [[H3117]] of Jehoiakim [[H3079]] son [[H1121]] of Josiah [[H2977]] king [[H4428]] of Judah, [[H3063]] until [[H5704]] the fifth [[H2549]] month [[H2320]] of the eleventh [[H6249]] year [[H8141]] of Zedekiah [[H6667]] son [[H1121]] of Josiah [[H2977]] king [[H4428]] of Judah, [[H3063]] when [[H5704]] the people of Jerusalem [[H3389]] went into exile. [[H1540]]

###### 4
The word [[H1697]] of the LORD [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] to me, [[H413]] saying: [[H559]]

###### 5
“Before [[H2962]] I formed [[H3335]] you in the womb [[H990]] I knew you, [[H3045]] and before [[H2962]] you were born [[H3318]] I set you apart [[H6942]] [and] appointed [[H5414]] you a prophet [[H5030]] to the nations.” [[H1471]]

###### 6
“Ah, [[H162]] Lord [[H136]] GOD,” [[H3069]] I said, [[H559]] “I surely [[H2009]] do not [[H3808]] know [[H3045]] how to speak, [[H1696]] for [[H3588]] I [am] [[H595]] only a child!” [[H5288]]

###### 7
But the LORD [[H3068]] told [[H559]] me: [[H413]] “Do not [[H408]] say, [[H559]] ‘I [am] [[H595]] only a child.’ [[H5288]] For [[H3588]] to [[H5921]] everyone [[H3605]] I send you, [[H7971]] you must go, [[H1980]] and all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] I command you, [[H6680]] you must speak. [[H1696]]

###### 8
Do not [[H408]] be afraid [[H3372]] of them, [[H6440]] for [[H3588]] I [am] [[H589]] with you [[H854]] to deliver you,” [[H5337]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD. [[H3069]]

###### 9
Then the LORD [[H3068]] reached out [[H7971]] His hand, [[H3027]] touched [[H5060]] my mouth, [[H6310]] and said [[H559]] to me: [[H413]] “Behold, [[H2009]] I have put [[H5414]] My words [[H1697]] into your mouth. [[H6310]]

###### 10
See, [[H7200]] I have appointed [[H6485]] you today [[H3117]] over [[H5921]] nations [[H1471]] and kingdoms [[H4467]] to uproot [[H5428]] and tear down, [[H5422]] to destroy [[H6]] and overthrow, [[H2040]] to build [[H1129]] and plant.” [[H5193]]

###### 11
And the word [[H1697]] of the LORD [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] to me, [[H413]] asking, [[H559]] “What [[H4100]] do you [[H859]] see, [[H7200]] Jeremiah?” [[H3414]] “I [[H589]] see [[H7200]] a branch [[H4731]] of an almond tree,” [[H8247]] I replied. [[H559]]

###### 12
“You have observed [[H7200]] correctly,” [[H3190]] said [[H559]] the LORD, [[H3068]] “for [[H3588]] I [[H589]] am watching [[H8245]] over [[H5921]] My word [[H1697]] to accomplish it.” [[H6213]]

###### 13
Again [[H8145]] the word [[H1697]] of the LORD [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] to me, [[H413]] inquiring, [[H559]] “What [[H4100]] do you [[H859]] see?” [[H7200]] “I [[H589]] see [[H7200]] a boiling [[H5301]] pot,” [[H5518]] I replied, [[H559]] “and it is tilting [[H6440]] away from [[H6440]] the north.” [[H6828]]

###### 14
Then the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H559]] to me, [[H413]] “Disaster [[H7451]] from the north [[H6828]] will be poured out [[H6605]] on [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] who live [[H3427]] in the land. [[H776]]

###### 15
For [[H3588]] I am about to summon [[H7121]] all [[H3605]] the clans [[H4940]] and kingdoms [[H4467]] of the north,” [[H6828]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD. [[H3068]] “[Their kings] will come [[H935]] and set up [[H5414]] their thrones [[H3678]] at the entrance [[H6607]] to Jerusalem’s [[H3389]] gates. [[H8179]] They will attack [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] her surrounding [[H5439]] walls [[H2346]] and all [[H3605]] the other cities [[H5892]] of Judah. [[H3063]]

###### 16
I will pronounce [[H1696]] My judgments [[H4941]] against them [[H5921]] for all [[H3605]] the evil [[H7451]] they did, [[H834]] when they abandoned Me [[H5800]] to burn incense [[H6999]] to other [[H312]] gods [[H430]] and to worship [[H7812]] the works [[H4639]] of their own hands. [[H3027]]

###### 17
Get yourself [[H859]] ready. [[H247]] Stand up [[H6965]] and tell [[H1696]] them everything [[H3605]] that [[H834]] I [[H595]] command you. [[H6680]] Do not [[H408]] be intimidated [[H2865]] by them, [[H6440]] or [[H6435]] I will terrify you [[H2865]] before them. [[H6440]]

###### 18
Now behold, [[H2009]] this day [[H3117]] I [[H589]] have made [[H5414]] you a fortified [[H4013]] city, [[H5892]] an iron [[H1270]] pillar, [[H5982]] and bronze [[H5178]] walls [[H2346]] against [[H5921]] the whole [[H3605]] land— [[H776]] against the kings [[H4428]] of Judah, [[H3063]] its officials, [[H8269]] its priests, [[H3548]] and the people [[H5971]] of the land. [[H776]]

###### 19
They will fight [[H3898]] against you [[H413]] but never [[H3808]] overcome you, [[H3201]] since [[H3588]] I [[H589]] am with [[H854]] you to rescue you,” [[H5337]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD. [[H3068]]
