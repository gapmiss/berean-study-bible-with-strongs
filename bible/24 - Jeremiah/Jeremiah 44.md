###### 1
This is the word [[H1697]] that [[H834]] came [[H1961]] to [[H413]] Jeremiah [[H3414]] concerning [[H413]] all [[H3605]] the Jews [[H3064]] living [[H3427]] in the land [[H776]] of Egypt— [[H4714]] in Migdol, [[H4024]] Tahpanhes, [[H8471]] and Memphis— [[H5297]] and in the land [[H776]] of Pathros: [[H6624]]

###### 2
“This is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts, [[H6635]] the God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] says: [[H559]] You [[H859]] have seen [[H7200]] all [[H3605]] the disaster [[H7451]] I brought [[H935]] against [[H5921]] Jerusalem [[H3389]] and all [[H3605]] the cities [[H5892]] of Judah; [[H3063]] and behold, [[H2005]] they lie today in ruins [[H2723]] and [[H2088]] desolation [[H369]]

###### 3
because of [[H6440]] the evil [[H7451]] they have done. [[H6213]] They provoked Me to anger [[H3707]] by continuing [[H1980]] to burn incense [[H6999]] [and] to serve [[H5647]] other [[H312]] gods [[H430]] that neither [[H3808]] they [[H1992]] [nor] you [[H859]] nor your fathers [[H1]] ever knew. [[H3045]]

###### 4
Yet I sent [[H7971]] you [[H413]] all [[H3605]] My servants [[H5650]] the prophets [[H5030]] again and again, [[H7925]] saying: [[H559]] ‘Do not [[H408]] do [[H6213]] this [[H2063]] detestable [[H8441]] thing [[H1697]] that [[H834]] I hate.’ [[H8130]]

###### 5
But they did not [[H3808]] listen [[H8085]] or incline [[H5186]] their ears; [[H241]] they did not [[H3808]] turn [[H7725]] from their wickedness [[H7451]] or stop [[H1115]] burning incense [[H6999]] to other [[H312]] gods. [[H430]]

###### 6
Therefore My wrath [[H2534]] and anger [[H639]] poured out [[H5413]] and burned [[H1197]] in the cities [[H5892]] of Judah [[H3063]] and in the streets [[H2351]] of Jerusalem, [[H3389]] so they have become [[H1961]] the desolate [[H2723]] ruin [[H8077]] they are today. [[H3117]]

###### 7
So now, [[H6258]] this is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] God [[H430]] of Hosts, [[H6635]] the God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] says: [[H559]] Why [[H4100]] are you [[H859]] doing [[H6213]] such great [[H1419]] harm [[H7451]] to [[H413]] yourselves? [[H5315]] You are cutting off [[H3772]] from [[H8432]] Judah [[H3063]] man [[H376]] and woman, [[H802]] child [[H5768]] and infant, [[H3243]] leaving [[H3498]] yourselves  without [[H1115]] a remnant, [[H7611]]

###### 8
provoking Me to anger [[H3707]] by the work [[H4639]] of your hands, [[H3027]] burning incense [[H6999]] to other [[H312]] gods [[H430]] in the land [[H776]] of Egypt [[H4714]] where [[H834]] you [[H859]] have gone [[H935]] to reside. [[H1481]] As a result, [[H4616]] you will be cut off [[H3772]] and become [[H1961]] an object of cursing [[H7045]] and reproach [[H2781]] among all [[H3605]] the nations [[H1471]] of the earth. [[H776]]

###### 9
Have you forgotten [[H7911]] the wickedness [[H7451]] of your fathers [[H1]] and [[H853]] of the kings [[H4428]] of Judah [[H3063]] and [[H853]] their wives, [[H802]] as well as [[H853]] the wickedness that [[H7451]] you [[H853]] and [[H7451]] your wives [[H802]] committed [[H6213]] in the land [[H776]] of Judah [[H3063]] and the streets [[H2351]] of Jerusalem? [[H3389]]

###### 10
To [[H5704]] this [[H2088]] day [[H3117]] they have not [[H3808]] humbled themselves [[H1792]] [or] [[H3808]] shown reverence, [[H3372]] nor [[H3808]] have they followed [[H1980]] My instruction [[H8451]] or the statutes [[H2708]] that [[H834]] I set [[H5414]] before you [[H6440]] and [[H6440]] your fathers. [[H1]]

###### 11
Therefore, [[H3651]] this is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts, [[H6635]] the God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] says: [[H559]] I will set [[H7760]] My face [[H6440]] to bring disaster [[H7451]] and to cut off [[H3772]] all [[H3605]] Judah. [[H3063]]

###### 12
And I will take away [[H3947]] the remnant [[H7611]] of Judah [[H3063]] who [[H834]] have resolved [[H7760]] to go [[H935]] to the land [[H776]] of Egypt [[H4714]] to reside there; [[H8033]] they will meet their end. [[H8552]] [They] will all [[H3605]] fall [[H5307]] by the sword [[H2719]] [or] [[H8552]] by famine. [[H7458]] From the least [[H6996]] to [[H5704]] the greatest, [[H1419]] they will die [[H4191]] by sword [[H2719]] or famine. [[H7458]] Then they will become [[H1961]] an object of cursing [[H423]] [and] horror, [[H8047]] of vilification [[H7045]] and reproach. [[H2781]]

###### 13
I will punish [[H6485]] those who live [[H3427]] in the land [[H776]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] just as [[H834]] I punished [[H6485]] Jerusalem, [[H3389]] by sword, [[H2719]] famine, [[H7458]] and plague, [[H1698]]

###### 14
so that none of [[H3808]] the remnant [[H7611]] of Judah [[H3063]] who have gone [[H935]] to reside [[H1481]] in Egypt [[H4714]] will [[H1961]] escape [[H6412]] or survive [[H8300]] to return [[H7725]] to the land [[H776]] of Judah, [[H3063]] where [[H834]] they [[H1992]] long [[H5375]] to return [[H7725]] and dwell; [[H3427]] for [[H3588]] none [[H3808]] will return [[H7725]] except [[H3588]] a few fugitives. [[H6412]]

###### 15
Then all [[H3605]] the men [[H376]] who knew [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] their wives [[H802]] were burning incense [[H6999]] to other [[H312]] gods, [[H430]] all [[H3605]] the women [[H802]] standing by— [[H5975]] a great [[H1419]] assembly— [[H6951]] along with all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] who were living [[H3427]] in the land [[H776]] of Egypt [[H4714]] at Pathros, [[H6624]] answered [[H6030]] Jeremiah, [[H3414]]

###### 16
“As for the word [[H1697]] you spoke [[H1696]] to [[H413]] us in the name [[H8034]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] we will not [[H369]] listen [[H8085]] to you! [[H413]]

###### 17
Instead, [[H3588]] we will do [[H6213]] everything [[H3605]] we said: [[H3318]] We will burn incense [[H6999]] to the queen [[H4446]] of heaven [[H8064]] and offer [[H5258]] drink offerings [[H5262]] to her, [[H834]] just as [[H834]] we, [[H587]] our fathers, [[H1]] our kings, [[H4428]] and our officials [[H8269]] did [[H6213]] in the cities [[H5892]] of Judah [[H3063]] and in the streets [[H2351]] of Jerusalem. [[H3389]] At that time we had plenty [[H7646]] of food [[H3899]] and good things, [[H2896]] and we saw [[H7200]] no [[H3808]] disaster. [[H7451]]

###### 18
But from the time [[H4480]] we stopped [[H2308]] burning incense [[H6999]] to the queen [[H4446]] of heaven [[H8064]] and pouring out [[H5258]] drink offerings [[H5262]] to her,  we have lacked [[H2637]] everything [[H3605]] and have been perishing [[H8552]] by sword [[H2719]] and famine.” [[H7458]]

###### 19
“Moreover,” [said the women,] “when [[H3588]] we [[H587]] burned incense [[H6999]] to the queen [[H4446]] of heaven [[H8064]] and poured out [[H5258]] drink offerings to her, [[H5262]] was it without [[H1107]] our husbands’ {knowledge} [[H582]] that we made [[H6213]] sacrificial cakes [[H3561]] in her image [[H6087]] and poured out [[H5258]] drink offerings to her?” [[H5262]]

###### 20
Then Jeremiah [[H3414]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] who were answering him, [[H6030]] both men [[H1397]] and women, [[H802]]

###### 21
“As for the incense [[H7002]] you burned [[H6999]] in the cities [[H5892]] of Judah [[H3063]] and the streets [[H2351]] of Jerusalem— [[H3389]] you, [[H859]] your fathers, [[H1]] your kings, [[H4428]] your officials, [[H8269]] and the people [[H5971]] of the land— [[H776]] did the LORD [[H3068]] not [[H3808]] remember [[H2142]] and bring [[H5927]] this to [[H5921]] mind? [[H3820]]

###### 22
So the LORD [[H3068]] could [[H3201]] no [[H3808]] longer [[H5750]] endure [[H5375]] the evil [[H7455]] deeds [[H4611]] and detestable acts [[H8441]] you committed, [[H6213]] and your land [[H776]] became [[H1961]] a desolation, [[H2723]] a horror, [[H8047]] and an object of cursing, [[H7045]] without [[H369]] inhabitant, [[H3427]] as it is today. [[H3117]]

###### 23
Because [[H6440]] you burned incense [[H6999]] and sinned [[H2398]] against the LORD, [[H3069]] and did not [[H3808]] obey [[H8085]] the voice [[H6963]] of the LORD [[H3069]] [or] [[H3808]] walk [[H1980]] in [[H5921]] His instruction, [[H8451]] His statutes, [[H2708]] and His testimonies, [[H5715]] this [[H2063]] disaster [[H7451]] has befallen you, [[H7122]] as you see today.” [[H3117]]

###### 24
Then Jeremiah [[H3414]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] all [[H3605]] the people, [[H5971]] including all [[H3605]] the women, [[H802]] “Hear [[H8085]] the word [[H1697]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] all those [[H3605]] of Judah [[H3063]] who [[H834]] are in the land [[H776]] of Egypt. [[H4714]]

###### 25
This is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts, [[H6635]] the God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] says: [[H559]] ‘As for you [[H859]] and your wives, [[H802]] you have spoken [[H1696]] with your mouths [[H6310]] and fulfilled [[H4390]] with your hands [[H3027]] your words, [[H559]] “We will surely [[H6213]] perform [[H6213]] our vows [[H5088]] that [[H834]] we have made [[H5087]] to burn incense [[H6999]] to the queen [[H4446]] of heaven [[H8064]] and to pour out [[H5258]] drink offerings [[H5262]] to her.  Go ahead, then, [[H6965]] do [[H6965]] what you have promised! [[H5088]] Keep [[H6213]] your vows! [[H5088]]

###### 26
Nevertheless, [[H3651]] hear [[H8085]] the word [[H1697]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] all [[H3605]] you Jews [[H3063]] living [[H3427]] in Egypt: [[H4714]] Behold, [[H2005]] I have sworn [[H7650]] by My great [[H1419]] name, [[H8034]] says [[H559]] the LORD, [[H3068]] that My name [[H8034]] will never [[H518]] again [[H5750]] be [[H1961]] invoked [[H7121]] by [[H6310]] anyone [[H3605]] of Judah [[H3063]] in all [[H3605]] the land [[H776]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] saying, [[H559]] As surely as the Lord [[H136]] GOD [[H3069]] lives. [[H2416]]

###### 27
I am watching [[H8245]] over them [[H5921]] for harm [[H7451]] and not [[H3808]] for good, [[H2896]] and every [[H3605]] man [[H376]] of Judah [[H3063]] who [[H834]] is in the land [[H776]] of Egypt [[H4714]] will meet his end [[H8552]] by sword [[H2719]] or famine, [[H7458]] until [[H5704]] they are finished off. [[H3615]]

###### 28
Those who escape [[H6412]] the sword [[H2719]] will return [[H7725]] from [[H4480]] Egypt [[H4714]] to Judah, [[H3063]] few [[H4962]] in number, [[H4557]] and the whole [[H3605]] remnant [[H7611]] of Judah [[H3063]] who went [[H935]] to dwell [[H8033]] in the land [[H776]] of Egypt [[H4714]] will know [[H3045]] whose [[H4310]] word [[H1697]] will stand, [[H6965]] Mine [[H4480]] or theirs! [[H1992]]

###### 29
This [[H2063]] will be a sign to you, [[H226]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD, [[H3068]] that [[H3588]] I [[H589]] will punish [[H6485]] you [[H5921]] in this [[H2088]] place, [[H4725]] so [[H4616]] you may know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] My threats [[H1697]] of harm [[H7451]] against you [[H5921]] will surely [[H6965]] stand. [[H6965]]

###### 30
This is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] says: [[H559]] Behold, [[H2005]] I am going to hand [[H5414]] Pharaoh Hophra [[H6548]] king [[H4428]] of Egypt [[H4714]] over to [[H3027]] his enemies, [[H341]] to those who seek [[H1245]] his life, [[H5315]] just as [[H834]] I handed [[H3027]] Zedekiah [[H6667]] king [[H4428]] of Judah [[H3063]] over to [[H5414]] Nebuchadnezzar [[H5019]] king [[H4428]] of Babylon, [[H894]] the enemy [[H341]] who was seeking [[H1245]] his life. [[H5315]]
