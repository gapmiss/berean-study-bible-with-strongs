###### 1
Righteous [[H6662]] [are] You, [[H859]] O LORD, [[H3068]] when [[H3588]] I plead [[H7378]] before You. [[H413]] Yet [[H389]] I wish to contend [[H4941]] with You: [[H854]] Why [[H4069]] does the way [[H1870]] of the wicked [[H7563]] prosper? [[H6743]] Why do all the faithless [[H898]] live at ease? [[H7951]]

###### 2
You planted them, [[H5193]] and [[H1571]] they have taken root. [[H8327]] They have grown [[H1980]] and [[H1571]] produced [[H6213]] fruit. [[H6529]] You [[H859]] are ever on their lips, [[H6310]] but far [[H7350]] from their conscience. [[H3629]]

###### 3
But You [[H859]] know me, [[H3045]] O LORD; [[H3068]] You see me [[H7200]] and test [[H974]] my heart [[H3820]] toward You. [[H854]] Drag away [the wicked] [[H5423]] like sheep [[H6629]] to the slaughter [[H2878]] and set them apart [[H6942]] for the day [[H3117]] of carnage. [[H2028]]

###### 4
How long [[H5704]] will the land [[H776]] mourn [[H56]] and the grass [[H6212]] of every [[H3605]] field [[H7704]] be withered? [[H3001]] Because of the evil [[H7451]] of its residents, [[H3427]] the animals [[H929]] and birds [[H5775]] have been swept away, [[H5595]] for [[H3588]] the people have said, [[H559]] “He cannot [[H3808]] see [[H7200]] what our end will be.” [[H319]]

###### 5
“If [[H3588]] you have raced [[H7323]] with [[H854]] men on foot [[H7273]] and they have worn you out, [[H3811]] how [[H349]] can you compete [[H8474]] with [[H854]] horses? [[H5483]] If you [[H859]] stumble [[H982]] in a peaceful [[H7965]] land, [[H776]] how [[H349]] will you do [[H6213]] in the thickets [[H1347]] of the Jordan? [[H3383]]

###### 6
Even [[H3588]] your brothers— [[H251]] your own father’s [[H1]] household— [[H1004]] even [[H1571]] they [[H1992]] have betrayed you; [[H898]] even [[H1571]] they [[H1992]] have cried [[H7121]] aloud [[H4392]] against you. [[H310]] Do not [[H408]] trust them, [[H539]] though [[H3588]] they speak [[H1696]] well [[H2896]] of you. [[H413]]

###### 7
I have forsaken [[H5800]] My house; [[H1004]] I have abandoned [[H5203]] My inheritance. [[H5159]] I have given [[H5414]] the love [[H3033]] of My life [[H5315]] into the hands [[H3709]] of her enemies. [[H341]]

###### 8
My inheritance [[H5159]] has become [[H1961]] to Me  like a lion [[H738]] in the forest. [[H3293]] She has roared [[H5414]] against Me; [[H5921]] therefore [[H5921]] I hate her. [[H8130]]

###### 9
Is [not] My inheritance [[H5159]] to Me  like a speckled [[H6641]] bird of prey, [[H5861]] with [other] birds of prey [[H5861]] circling [[H5439]] against her? [[H5921]] Go, [[H1980]] gather [[H622]] all [[H3605]] the beasts [[H2416]] of the field; [[H7704]] bring [[H857]] them to devour her. [[H402]]

###### 10
Many [[H7227]] shepherds [[H7462]] have destroyed [[H7843]] My vineyard; [[H3754]] they have trampled [[H947]] My plot of land. [[H2513]] They have turned [[H5414]] My pleasant [[H2532]] field [[H2513]] into a desolate [[H8077]] wasteland. [[H4057]]

###### 11
They have made [[H7760]] it a desolation. [[H8077]] Desolate [[H8076]] before Me, [[H5921]] it mourns; [[H56]] all [[H3605]] the land [[H776]] is laid waste, [[H8074]] but [[H3588]] no [[H369]] man [[H376]] takes [[H7760]] it to [[H5921]] heart. [[H3820]]

###### 12
Over [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] the barren heights [[H8205]] in the wilderness [[H4057]] the destroyers [[H7703]] have come, [[H935]] for [[H3588]] the sword [[H2719]] of the LORD [[H3068]] devours [[H398]] from [one] end [[H7097]] of the earth [[H776]] to [[H5704]] the other. [[H7097]] No [[H369]] flesh [[H1320]] shall have peace. [[H7965]]

###### 13
They have sown [[H2232]] wheat [[H2406]] but harvested [[H7114]] thorns. [[H6975]] They have exhausted themselves [[H2470]] to no [[H3808]] avail. [[H3276]] Bear the shame [[H954]] of your harvest [[H8393]] because of the fierce [[H2740]] anger [[H639]] of the LORD.” [[H3068]]

###### 14
This is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] says: [[H559]] “As for [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] My evil [[H7451]] neighbors [[H7934]] who attack [[H5060]] the inheritance [[H5159]] that [[H834]] I bequeathed [[H5157]] to My people [[H5971]] Israel, [[H3478]] I am about to uproot them [[H5428]] from [[H5921]] their land, [[H127]] and [[H853]] I will uproot [[H5428]] the house [[H1004]] of Judah [[H3063]] from among them. [[H8432]]

###### 15
But [[H1961]] after [[H310]] I have uprooted them, [[H5428]] I will once again [[H7725]] have compassion on them [[H7355]] and return [[H7725]] each one [[H376]] to his inheritance [[H5159]] and to his land. [[H776]]

###### 16
And [[H1961]] if [[H518]] they will diligently learn [[H3925]] the ways [[H1870]] of My people— [[H5971]] to swear [[H7650]] by My name, [[H8034]] ‘As surely as the LORD [[H3069]] lives,’ [[H2416]] just as [[H834]] they taught [[H3925]] My people [[H5971]] to swear [[H7650]] by Baal— [[H1168]] then they will be established [[H1129]] among [[H8432]] My people. [[H5971]]

###### 17
But if [[H518]] they will not [[H3808]] obey, [[H8085]] then I will uproot [[H5428]] that [[H1931]] nation; [[H1471]] I will uproot it [[H5428]] and destroy it,” [[H6]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD. [[H3068]]
