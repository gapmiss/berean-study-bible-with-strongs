### 1
This [[H428]] is the text [[H1697]] of the letter [[H5612]] that [[H834]] Jeremiah [[H3414]] the prophet [[H5030]] sent [[H7971]] from Jerusalem [[H3389]] to [[H413]] the rest [[H3499]] of the elders [[H2205]] among the exiles, [[H1473]] the priests, [[H3548]] the prophets, [[H5030]] and all [[H3605]] the others [[H5971]] Nebuchadnezzar [[H5019]] had carried into exile [[H1540]] from Jerusalem [[H3389]] to Babylon. [[H894]]

### 2
(This was after [[H310]] King [[H4428]] Jeconiah, [[H3204]] the queen mother, [[H1377]] the court officials, [[H5631]] the officials [[H8269]] of Judah [[H3063]] and Jerusalem, [[H3389]] the craftsmen, [[H2796]] and the metalsmiths [[H4525]] had been exiled [[H3318]] from Jerusalem.) [[H3389]]

### 3
The letter was entrusted to [[H3027]] Elasah [[H501]] son [[H1121]] of Shaphan [[H8227]] and Gemariah [[H1587]] son [[H1121]] of Hilkiah, [[H2518]] whom [[H834]] Zedekiah [[H6667]] king [[H4428]] of Judah [[H3063]] had sent [[H7971]] to [[H413]] King [[H4428]] Nebuchadnezzar [[H5019]] in Babylon. [[H894]] It stated: [[H559]]

### 4
“This is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts, [[H6635]] the God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] says [[H559]] to all [[H3605]] the exiles [[H1473]] I carried away [[H1540]] from Jerusalem [[H3389]] to Babylon: [[H894]]

### 5
‘Build [[H1129]] houses [[H1004]] and settle down. [[H3427]] Plant [[H5193]] gardens [[H1593]] and eat [[H398]] their produce. [[H6529]]

### 6
Take [[H3947]] wives [[H802]] and have [[H3205]] sons [[H1121]] and daughters. [[H1323]] Take [[H3947]] wives [[H802]] for your sons [[H1121]] and give [[H5414]] your daughters [[H1323]] in marriage, [[H582]] so that they too may have [[H3205]] sons [[H1121]] and daughters. [[H1323]] Multiply [[H7235]] there; [[H8033]] do not [[H408]] decrease. [[H4591]]

### 7
Seek [[H1875]] the prosperity [[H7965]] of the city [[H5892]] to which [[H834]] I have sent you as exiles. [[H1540]] Pray [[H6419]] to [[H413]] the LORD [[H3068]] on its behalf, [[H1157]] for [[H3588]] if it prospers, [[H7965]] you too will prosper.’ [[H7965]]

### 8
For [[H3588]] this is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts, [[H6635]] the God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] says: [[H559]] ‘Do not [[H408]] be deceived [[H5377]] by the prophets [[H5030]] and diviners [[H7080]] among you, [[H7130]] and do not [[H408]] listen [[H8085]] to [[H413]] the dreams [[H2472]] you elicit from them. [[H859]]

### 9
For [[H3588]] they [[H1992]] are falsely prophesying [[H5012]] to you  in My name; [[H8034]] I have not [[H3808]] sent them, [[H7971]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD.’” [[H3068]]

### 10
For [[H3588]] this is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] says: [[H559]] “When [[H3588]] Babylon’s [[H894]] seventy [[H7657]] years [[H8141]] are complete, [[H4390]] I will attend to [[H6485]] you [[H853]] and confirm [[H6965]] My promise [[H1697]] to restore [[H7725]] you [[H853]] to [[H413]] this [[H2088]] place. [[H4725]]

### 11
For [[H3588]] I [[H595]] know [[H3045]] the plans [[H4284]] I [[H595]] have [[H2803]] for you, [[H5921]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD, [[H3068]] plans [[H4284]] to prosper you [[H7965]] and not [[H3808]] to harm you, [[H7451]] to give [[H5414]] you  a future [[H319]] and a hope. [[H8615]]

### 12
Then you will call [[H7121]] upon Me [[H853]] and come [[H1980]] and pray [[H6419]] to Me, [[H413]] and I will listen [[H8085]] to you. [[H413]]

### 13
You will seek [[H1245]] Me [[H853]] and find Me [[H4672]] when [[H3588]] you search for Me [[H1875]] with all [[H3605]] your heart. [[H3824]]

### 14
I will be found by you, [[H4672]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD, [[H3068]] and I will restore you [[H7725]] from captivity [[H7622]] and gather [[H6908]] you [[H853]] from all [[H3605]] the nations [[H1471]] and places [[H4725]] to which [[H834]] I have banished you, [[H5080]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD. [[H3068]] I will restore [[H7725]] you to [[H413]] the place [[H4725]] from which [[H834]] I sent [[H1540]] you [[H853]] into exile. [[H8033]]

### 15
Because [[H3588]] you may say, [[H559]] “The LORD [[H3068]] has raised up [[H6965]] for us  prophets [[H5030]] in Babylon,” [[H894]]

### 16
this is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] says [[H559]] about [[H413]] the king [[H4428]] who sits [[H3427]] on [[H413]] David’s [[H1732]] throne [[H3678]] and [[H413]] all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] who remain [[H3427]] in this [[H2063]] city, [[H5892]] your brothers [[H251]] who [[H834]] did not [[H3808]] go [[H3318]] with you [[H854]] into exile. [[H1473]]

### 17
This is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts [[H6635]] says: [[H559]] “I will send [[H7971]] against them [[H853]] sword, [[H2719]] famine, [[H7458]] and plague, [[H1698]] and I will make [[H5414]] them like rotten [[H8182]] figs, [[H8384]] so bad [[H7455]] that [[H834]] they cannot be eaten. [[H398]]

### 18
I will pursue [[H7291]] them with sword, [[H2719]] famine, [[H7458]] and plague. [[H1698]] I will make [[H5414]] them  a horror [[H2113]] to all [[H3605]] the kingdoms [[H4467]] of the earth— [[H776]] a curse, [[H423]] a desolation, [[H8047]] and an object of scorn [[H8322]] and reproach [[H2781]] among all [[H3605]] the nations [[H1471]] to which [[H834]] I banish them. [[H5080]]

### 19
I will do this because [[H8478]] they have not [[H3808]] listened [[H8085]] to [[H413]] My words, [[H1697]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD, [[H3068]] which [[H834]] I sent [[H7971]] to [[H413]] them [[H854]] time and again [[H7925]] with My servants [[H5650]] the prophets. [[H5030]] And neither have you [exiles] [[H3808]] listened, [[H8085]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD. [[H3068]]

### 20
So hear [[H8085]] the word [[H1697]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] all [[H3605]] you exiles [[H1473]] I have sent away [[H7971]] from Jerusalem [[H3389]] to Babylon. [[H894]]

### 21
This is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts, [[H6635]] the God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] says [[H559]] about [[H413]] Ahab [[H256]] son [[H1121]] of Kolaiah [[H6964]] and [[H413]] Zedekiah [[H6667]] son [[H1121]] of Maaseiah, [[H4641]] who are prophesying [[H5012]] to you  lies [[H8267]] in My name: [[H8034]] “I will deliver [[H5414]] them [[H853]] to [[H3027]] Nebuchadnezzar [[H5019]] king [[H4428]] of Babylon, [[H894]] and he will kill them [[H5221]] before your very eyes. [[H5869]]

### 22
Because [[H3947]] of them, [[H1992]] all [[H3605]] the exiles [[H1546]] of Judah [[H3063]] who [[H834]] are in Babylon [[H894]] will use this curse: [[H7045]] ‘May the LORD [[H3068]] make [[H7760]] you like Zedekiah [[H6667]] and Ahab, [[H256]] whom [[H834]] the king [[H4428]] of Babylon [[H894]] roasted [[H7033]] in the fire!’ [[H784]]

### 23
For [[H3282]] they have committed [[H6213]] an outrage [[H5039]] in Israel [[H3478]] by committing adultery [[H5003]] with [[H854]] the wives [[H802]] of their neighbors [[H7453]] and speaking [[H1696]] lies [[H8267]] in My name, [[H8034]] which [[H834]] I did not [[H3808]] command them [to do]. [[H6680]] I [[H595]] am He who knows, [[H1931]] and I am a witness, [[H5707]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD. [[H3068]]

### 24
You are to say [[H559]] to [[H413]] Shemaiah [[H8098]] the Nehelamite, [[H5161]]

### 25
“This is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts, [[H6635]] the God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] says: [[H559]] In your own name [[H8034]] you [[H859]] have sent out [[H7971]] letters [[H5612]] to [[H413]] all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] of Jerusalem, [[H3389]] to [[H413]] the priest [[H3548]] Zephaniah [[H6846]] son [[H1121]] of Maaseiah, [[H4641]] and to [[H413]] all [[H3605]] the priests, [[H3548]] saying: [[H559]]

### 26
‘The LORD [[H3068]] has appointed [[H5414]] you priest [[H3548]] in place of [[H8478]] Jehoiada, [[H3077]] to be [[H1961]] the chief officer [[H6496]] in the house [[H1004]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] responsible for any [[H3605]] madman [[H376]] who acts like a prophet— [[H5012]] you must put [[H5414]] him [[H853]] in [[H413]] stocks [[H4115]] and neck irons. [[H6729]]

### 27
So now, [[H6258]] why [[H4100]] have you not [[H3808]] rebuked [[H1605]] Jeremiah [[H3414]] of Anathoth, [[H6069]] who poses as a prophet [[H5012]] among you? 

### 28
For [[H3588]] he has sent [[H7971]] to us [[H413]] [in] Babylon, [[H894]] claiming: [[H559]] The exile [[H1931]] will be long. [[H752]] So build [[H1129]] houses [[H1004]] and settle down; [[H3427]] plant [[H5193]] gardens [[H1593]] and eat [[H398]] their produce.’” [[H6529]]

### 29
And Zephaniah [[H6846]] the priest [[H3548]] read [[H7121]] this [[H2088]] letter [[H5612]] [to] [[H241]] Jeremiah [[H3414]] the prophet. [[H5030]]

### 30
Then the word [[H1697]] of the LORD [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] to [[H413]] Jeremiah: [[H3414]]

### 31
“Send [[H7971]] a message to [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] the exiles: [[H1473]] This is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] says [[H559]] concerning [[H413]] Shemaiah [[H8098]] the Nehelamite. [[H5161]] Because [[H3282]] Shemaiah prophesied to you, [[H5012]] though I [[H589]] did not [[H3808]] send him, [[H7971]] and made you trust [[H982]] in [[H5921]] a lie, [[H8267]]

### 32
this is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3069]] says: [[H559]] Behold, [[H2005]] I will punish [[H6485]] Shemaiah [[H8098]] the Nehelamite [[H5161]] and his descendants. [[H2233]] He will have [[H1961]] no [[H3808]] one [[H376]] left [[H3427]] among [[H8432]] this [[H2088]] people, [[H5971]] nor [[H3808]] will he see [[H7200]] the good [[H2896]] that [[H834]] I [[H589]] bring [[H6213]] to My people, [[H5971]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD, [[H3069]] for [[H3588]] he has preached [[H1696]] rebellion [[H5627]] against [[H5921]] the LORD. [[H3069]]
