###### 1
This is the word [[H1697]] that [[H834]] came [[H1961]] to [[H413]] Jeremiah [[H3414]] from [[H853]] the LORD [[H3068]] when King [[H4428]] Zedekiah [[H6667]] sent [[H7971]] to [him] [[H413]] Pashhur [[H6583]] son [[H1121]] of Malchijah [[H4441]] and the priest [[H3548]] Zephaniah [[H6846]] son [[H1121]] of Maaseiah, [[H4641]] saying, [[H559]]

###### 2
“Please [[H4994]] inquire [[H1875]] of the LORD [[H3068]] on our behalf, [[H1157]] since [[H3588]] Nebuchadnezzar [[H5019]] king [[H4428]] of Babylon [[H894]] is waging war [[H3898]] against us. [[H5921]] Perhaps [[H194]] the LORD [[H3068]] will perform [[H6213]] for us [[H854]] something like all [[H3605]] His past wonders, [[H6381]] so that [Nebuchadnezzar] will withdraw [[H5927]] from us.” [[H5921]]

###### 3
But Jeremiah [[H3414]] answered, [[H559]] “You are to tell [[H559]] Zedekiah [[H6667]] the following: [[H3541]]

###### 4
‘This is what [[H3541]] the LORD, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] says: [[H559]] I will turn [[H5437]] against you [[H853]] the weapons [[H3627]] of war [[H4421]] in your hands, [[H3027]] with which [[H834]] you [[H859]] are fighting [[H3898]] the king [[H4428]] of Babylon [[H894]] and the Chaldeans [[H3778]] who besiege [[H6696]] you [[H5921]] outside [[H2351]] the wall, [[H2346]] and I will assemble [[H622]] [their forces] [[H853]] in [[H413]] the center [[H8432]] of this [[H2063]] city. [[H5892]]

###### 5
And I Myself [[H589]] will fight [[H3898]] against you [[H854]] with an outstretched [[H5186]] hand [[H3027]] and a mighty [[H2389]] arm, [[H2220]] with anger, [[H639]] fury, [[H2534]] and great [[H1419]] wrath. [[H7110]]

###### 6
I will strike down [[H5221]] the residents [[H3427]] of this [[H2063]] city, [[H5892]] both man [[H120]] and beast. [[H929]] They will die [[H4191]] in a terrible [[H1419]] plague. [[H1698]]

###### 7
After that, [[H310]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD, [[H3068]] I will hand over [[H5414]] King [[H4428]] Zedekiah [[H6667]] of Judah, [[H3063]] his officers, [[H5650]] and the people [[H5971]] in this [[H2063]] city [[H5892]] who survive [[H7604]] the plague [[H1698]] and sword [[H2719]] and famine, [[H7458]] to [[H3027]] King [[H4428]] Nebuchadnezzar [[H5019]] of Babylon [[H894]] and to [[H3027]] their enemies [[H341]] who seek [[H1245]] their lives. [[H5315]] He will put [[H5221]] them to the sword; [[H2719]] he will not [[H3808]] spare [[H2347]] them [[H5921]] [or] [[H3808]] show pity [[H2550]] [or] [[H3808]] compassion. [[H7355]]

###### 8
You are also to say [[H559]] to [[H413]] this [[H2088]] people, [[H5971]] ‘This is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3069]] says: [[H559]] Behold, [[H2005]] I set [[H5414]] before [[H6440]] you [[H853]] the way [[H1870]] of life [[H2416]] and the way [[H1870]] of death. [[H4194]]

###### 9
Whoever stays [[H3427]] in this [[H2063]] city [[H5892]] will die [[H4191]] by sword [[H2719]] and famine [[H7458]] and plague, [[H1698]] but whoever goes out [[H3318]] and surrenders [[H5307]] to [[H5921]] the Chaldeans [[H3778]] who besiege [[H6696]] you [[H5921]] will live [[H2421]] and retain [[H1961]] his life [[H5315]] like a spoil of war. [[H7998]]

###### 10
For [[H3588]] I have set [[H7760]] My face [[H6440]] against this [[H2063]] city [[H5892]] to bring disaster [[H7451]] and not [[H3808]] good, [[H2896]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD. [[H3068]] It will be handed over to [[H3027]] the king [[H4428]] of Babylon, [[H894]] who will destroy it [[H8313]] with fire.’ [[H784]]

###### 11
Moreover, [say] to the house [[H1004]] of the king [[H4428]] of Judah: [[H3063]] Hear [[H8085]] the word [[H1697]] of the LORD! [[H3068]]

###### 12
O house [[H1004]] of David, [[H1732]] this is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] says: [[H559]] ‘Administer [[H1777]] justice every morning, [[H4941]] and rescue [[H5337]] the victim of robbery [[H1497]] from the hand [[H3027]] of his oppressor, [[H6231]] or [[H6435]] My wrath [[H2534]] will go forth [[H3318]] like fire [[H784]] and burn [[H1197]] with none [[H369]] to extinguish it [[H3518]] because of [[H6440]] their evil [[H7455]] deeds. [[H4611]]

###### 13
Behold, [[H2005]] I am against you, [Jerusalem], [[H413]] you who sit [[H3427]] above the valley, [[H6010]] atop the rocky [[H6697]] plateau— [[H4334]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD— [[H3068]] you who say, [[H559]] “Who [[H4310]] can come [[H5181]] against us? [[H5921]] Who [[H4310]] can enter [[H935]] our habitations?” [[H4585]]

###### 14
I will punish [[H6485]] you [[H5921]] as your deeds deserve, [[H6529]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD. [[H3068]] I will kindle [[H3341]] a fire [[H784]] in your forest [[H3293]] that will consume [[H398]] everything [[H3605]] around [[H5439]] you.’”
