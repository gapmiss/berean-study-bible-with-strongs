###### 1
In the ninth [[H8671]] year [[H8141]] of Zedekiah [[H6667]] king [[H4428]] of Judah, [[H3063]] in the tenth [[H6224]] month, [[H2320]] King [[H4428]] Nebuchadnezzar [[H5019]] of Babylon [[H894]] advanced [[H935]] against [[H413]] Jerusalem [[H3389]] with his entire [[H3605]] army [[H2428]] and laid siege [[H6696]] to [the city]. [[H5921]]

###### 2
And on the ninth [[H8672]] day [[H2320]] of the fourth [[H7243]] month [[H2320]] of Zedekiah’s [[H6667]] eleventh [[H6249]] year, [[H8141]] the city [[H5892]] was broken through. [[H1234]]

###### 3
Then all [[H3605]] the officials [[H8269]] of the king [[H4428]] of Babylon [[H894]] entered [[H935]] and sat [[H3427]] in the Middle [[H8432]] Gate: [[H8179]] Nergal-sharezer, [[H5371]] Samgar, [[H5562]] Nebusarsechim [[H8310]] the Rab-saris, [[H7249]] Nergal-sharezer [[H5371]] the Rab-mag, [[H7248]] and all [[H3605]] the rest [[H7611]] of the officials [[H8269]] of the king [[H4428]] of Babylon. [[H894]]

###### 4
When [[H834]] Zedekiah [[H6667]] king [[H4428]] of Judah [[H3063]] and all [[H3605]] the soldiers [[H582]] saw them, [[H7200]] they fled. [[H1272]] They left [[H3318]] the city [[H5892]] at night [[H3915]] by way [[H1870]] of the king’s [[H4428]] garden, [[H1588]] through the gate [[H8179]] between [[H996]] the two walls, [[H2346]] and they went out [[H3318]] along the route [[H1870]] to the Arabah. [[H6160]]

###### 5
But the army [[H2428]] of the Chaldeans [[H3778]] pursued [[H7291]] them [[H310]] and overtook [[H5381]] Zedekiah [[H6667]] in the plains [[H6160]] of Jericho. [[H3405]] They seized [[H3947]] him [[H853]] and brought him up [[H5927]] to [[H413]] Nebuchadnezzar [[H5019]] king [[H4428]] of Babylon [[H894]] at Riblah [[H7247]] in the land [[H776]] of Hamath, [[H2574]] where he pronounced [[H1696]] judgment [[H4941]] on him. [[H853]]

###### 6
There at Riblah [[H7247]] the king [[H4428]] of Babylon [[H894]] slaughtered [[H7819]] the sons [[H1121]] of Zedekiah [[H6667]] before his eyes, [[H5869]] and he [[H4428]] also killed [[H7819]] all [[H3605]] the nobles [[H2715]] of Judah. [[H3063]]

###### 7
Then he put out [[H5786]] Zedekiah’s [[H6667]] eyes [[H5869]] and bound him [[H631]] with bronze chains [[H5178]] to take [[H935]] him [[H853]] to Babylon. [[H894]]

###### 8
The Chaldeans [[H3778]] set fire to [[H8313]] the palace [[H1004]] of the king [[H4428]] and [[H853]] to the houses [[H1004]] of the people, [[H5971]] and [[H853]] they tore down [[H5422]] the walls [[H2346]] of Jerusalem. [[H3389]]

###### 9
Then [[H853]] Nebuzaradan, [[H5018]] the captain [[H7227]] of the guard, [[H2876]] carried [[H1540]] away to Babylon [[H894]] the remnant [[H3499]] who had remained [[H7604]] in the city, [[H5892]] along with [[H853]] the deserters [[H5307]] who [[H834]] had defected [[H5307]] to [[H5921]] him [[H853]] and the rest [[H3499]] of the people. [[H5971]]

###### 10
But Nebuzaradan [[H5018]] left behind [[H7604]] in the land [[H776]] of Judah [[H3063]] some of [[H4480]] the poor [[H1800]] people, [[H5971]] who [[H834]] had no property, [[H369]] and at that [[H1931]] time [[H3117]] he gave [[H5414]] them vineyards [[H3754]] and fields. [[H3010]]

###### 11
Now Nebuchadnezzar [[H5019]] king [[H4428]] of Babylon [[H894]] had given orders [[H6680]] about [[H5921]] Jeremiah [[H3414]] through [[H3027]] Nebuzaradan [[H5018]] the captain [[H7227]] of the guard, [[H2876]] saying, [[H559]]

###### 12
“Take him, [[H3947]] look after [[H5869]] him, [[H5921]] and do not [[H408]] let any [[H3972]] harm [[H7451]] come to him; [[H6213]] do [[H6213]] for [[H5973]] him whatever [[H834]] he says.” [[H1696]]

###### 13
So Nebuzaradan [[H5018]] the captain [[H7227]] of the guard, [[H2876]] Nebushazban [[H5021]] the Rab-saris, [[H7249]] Nergal-sharezer [[H5371]] the Rab-mag, [[H7248]] and all [[H3605]] the captains [[H7227]] of the king [[H4428]] of Babylon [[H894]]

###### 14
had Jeremiah [[H3414]] brought [[H7971]] from the courtyard [[H2691]] of the guard, [[H4307]] and they turned him over [[H5414]] to [[H413]] Gedaliah [[H1436]] son [[H1121]] of Ahikam, [[H296]] the son [[H1121]] of Shaphan, [[H8227]] to take [[H3318]] him [[H413]] home. [[H1004]] So he remained [[H3427]] among [[H8432]] his own people. [[H5971]]

###### 15
And while [Jeremiah] had been [[H1961]] confined [[H6113]] in the courtyard [[H2691]] of the guard, [[H4307]] the word [[H1697]] of the LORD [[H3068]] had come [[H1961]] to [[H413]] [him]: [[H3414]]

###### 16
“Go [[H1980]] and tell [[H559]] Ebed-melech [[H5663]] the Cushite that [[H3569]] this is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts, [[H6635]] the God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] says: [[H559]] I am about to fulfill [[H935]] My words [[H1697]] against [[H413]] this [[H2063]] city [[H5892]] for harm [[H7451]] and not [[H3808]] for good, [[H2896]] and on that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] they will be fulfilled [[H1961]] before your eyes. [[H6440]]

###### 17
But I will deliver you [[H5337]] on that [[H1931]] day, [[H3117]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD, [[H3068]] and you will not [[H3808]] be handed over to [[H5414]] the men [[H376]] you [[H859]] fear. [[H3016]]

###### 18
For [[H3588]] I will surely rescue you [[H4422]] so that you do not [[H3808]] fall [[H5307]] by the sword. [[H2719]] Because [[H3588]] you have trusted in Me, [[H982]] you will escape [[H1961]] with  your life [[H5315]] like a spoil of war, [[H7998]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD.” [[H3068]]
