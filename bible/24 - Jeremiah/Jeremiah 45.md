###### 1
This is the word [[H1697]] that [[H834]] Jeremiah [[H3414]] the prophet [[H5030]] spoke [[H1696]] to [[H413]] Baruch [[H1263]] son [[H1121]] of Neriah [[H5374]] when he wrote [[H3789]] these [[H428]] words [[H1697]] on [[H5921]] a scroll [[H5612]] at the dictation [[H6310]] of Jeremiah [[H3414]] in the fourth [[H7243]] year [[H8141]] of Jehoiakim [[H3079]] son [[H1121]] of Josiah, [[H2977]] king [[H4428]] of Judah: [[H3063]]

###### 2
“This is what [[H3541]] the LORD, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] says [[H559]] to you, [[H5921]] Baruch: [[H1263]]

###### 3
You have said, [[H559]] ‘Woe is me, [[H188]] because [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] has added [[H3254]] sorrow [[H3015]] to [[H5921]] my pain! [[H4341]] I am worn out [[H3021]] with groaning [[H585]] and have found [[H4672]] no [[H3808]] rest.’” [[H4496]]

###### 4
Thus [[H3541]] [Jeremiah] was to say [[H559]] to [Baruch}: [[H413]] “This is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] says: [[H559]] I [[H589]] will demolish [[H2040]] what [[H834]] I have built [[H1129]] and uproot [[H5428]] what [[H834]] I have planted, [[H5193]] throughout [[H3605]] the land! [[H776]]

###### 5
But as for you, [[H859]] do you seek [[H1245]] great things for yourself? [[H1419]] Stop [[H408]] seeking! [[H1245]] For [[H3588]] I will bring [[H935]] disaster [[H7451]] on [[H5921]] every [[H3605]] living creature, [[H1320]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD, [[H3069]] but wherever [[H3605]] you go [[H1980]] I will grant [[H5414]] your life [[H5315]] as plunder.” [[H7998]]
