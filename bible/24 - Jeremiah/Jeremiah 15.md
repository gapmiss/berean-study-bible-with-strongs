### 1
Then the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H559]] to me: [[H413]] “Even if [[H518]] Moses [[H4872]] and Samuel [[H8050]] should stand [[H5975]] before Me, [[H6440]] My heart [[H5315]] would not [[H369]] go out to [[H413]] this [[H2088]] people. [[H5971]] Send [[H7971]] them from [[H5921]] My presence, [[H6440]] and let them go. [[H3318]]

### 2
If [[H3588]] they ask you, [[H559]] ‘Where [[H575]] shall we go?’ [[H3318]] you are to tell [[H559]] them that [[H413]] this is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] says: [[H559]] ‘Those [[H834]] destined for death, [[H4194]] to death; [[H4194]] those [[H834]] destined for the sword, [[H2719]] to the sword; [[H2719]] those [[H834]] destined for famine, [[H7458]] to famine; [[H7458]] those [[H834]] destined for captivity, [[H7628]] to captivity.’ [[H7628]]

### 3
I will appoint [[H6485]] over them [[H5921]] four [[H702]] kinds of destroyers, [[H4940]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD: [[H3068]] the sword [[H2719]] to kill, [[H2026]] the dogs [[H3611]] to drag away, [[H5498]] and the birds [[H5775]] of the air [[H8064]] and beasts [[H929]] of the earth [[H776]] to devour [[H398]] and destroy. [[H7843]]

### 4
I will make [[H5414]] them  a horror [[H2113]] to all [[H3605]] the kingdoms [[H4467]] of the earth [[H776]] because of [[H1558]] what [[H834]] Manasseh [[H4519]] son [[H1121]] of Hezekiah [[H2396]] king [[H4428]] of Judah [[H3063]] did [[H6213]] in Jerusalem. [[H3389]]

### 5
Who [[H4310]] will have pity [[H2550]] on you, [[H5921]] O Jerusalem? [[H3389]] Who [[H4310]] will mourn [[H5110]] for you?  Who [[H4310]] will turn aside [[H5493]] to ask [[H7592]] about your welfare? [[H7965]]

### 6
You [[H859]] have forsaken [[H5203]] Me, [[H853]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD. [[H3068]] You have turned your back, [[H268]] so I have stretched out [[H5186]] My hand [[H3027]] against you [[H5921]] to destroy you; [[H7843]] I am weary [[H3811]] of showing compassion. [[H5162]]

### 7
I will scatter them [[H2219]] with a winnowing fork [[H4214]] at the gates [[H8179]] of the land. [[H776]] I will bereave [[H7921]] and destroy [[H6]] My people [[H5971]] who have not [[H3808]] turned [[H7725]] from their ways. [[H1870]]

### 8
I will make their widows [[H490]] more numerous [[H6105]] than the sand [[H2344]] of the sea. [[H3220]] I will bring [[H935]] a destroyer [[H7703]] at noon [[H6672]] against [[H5921]] the mothers [[H517]] of young men. [[H970]] I will suddenly [[H6597]] bring [[H5307]] upon them [[H5921]] anguish [[H5892]] and dismay. [[H928]]

### 9
The mother [[H3205]] of seven [[H7651]] will grow faint; [[H535]] she will breath [[H5301]] her last breath. [[H5315]] Her sun [[H8121]] will set [[H935]] while it was still [[H5750]] day; [[H3119]] she will be disgraced [[H954]] and humiliated. [[H2659]] And the rest [[H7611]] I will put [[H5414]] to the sword [[H2719]] in the presence [[H6440]] of their enemies,” [[H341]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD. [[H3068]]

### 10
Woe to me, [[H188]] my mother, [[H517]] that [[H3588]] you have borne me, [[H3205]] a man [[H376]] of strife [[H7379]] and conflict [[H4066]] in all [[H3605]] the land. [[H776]] I have neither [[H3808]] lent [[H5383]] nor [[H3808]] borrowed, [[H5383]] yet everyone [[H3605]] curses me. [[H7043]]

### 11
The LORD [[H3068]] said: [[H559]] “Surely [[H518]] I will deliver you [[H8325]] for a good purpose; [[H2896]] surely I will [[H518]] intercede [[H6293]] with your enemy [[H341]] in your time [[H6256]] of trouble, [[H7451]] in your time [[H6256]] of distress. [[H6869]]

### 12
Can anyone smash [[H7489]] iron— [[H1270]] iron [[H1270]] from the north— [[H6828]] or bronze? [[H5178]]

### 13
Your wealth [[H2428]] and your treasures [[H214]] I will give up [[H5414]] as plunder, [[H957]] without [[H3808]] charge [[H4242]] for all [[H3605]] your sins [[H2403]] within all [[H3605]] your borders. [[H1366]]

### 14
Then I will enslave you [[H5674]] to [[H854]] your enemies [[H341]] in a land [[H776]] you do not [[H3808]] know, [[H3045]] for [[H3588]] My anger [[H639]] will kindle [[H6919]] a fire [[H784]] that will burn [[H3344]] against you.” [[H5921]]

### 15
You [[H859]] understand, [[H3045]] O LORD; [[H3068]] remember me [[H2142]] and attend to me. [[H6485]] Avenge me [[H5358]] against  my persecutors. [[H7291]] In Your patience, [[H750]] do not [[H408]] take me away. [[H3947]] Know that [[H3045]] I endure [[H5375]] reproach [[H2781]] for Your honor. [[H5921]]

### 16
Your words [[H1697]] were found, [[H4672]] and I ate them. [[H398]] Your words [[H1697]] became [[H1961]] a delight [[H8342]] to me  and my heart’s [[H3824]] delight, [[H8057]] for [[H3588]] I bear [[H7121]] Your name, [[H8034]] O LORD [[H3068]] God [[H430]] of Hosts. [[H6635]]

### 17
I never [[H3808]] sat [[H3427]] with the band [[H5475]] of revelers, [[H7832]] and I did not celebrate with them. [[H5937]] Because [[H6440]] Your hand was on me, [[H3027]] I sat [[H3427]] alone, [[H910]] for You have filled me [[H4390]] with indignation. [[H2195]]

### 18
Why [[H4100]] is [[H1961]] my pain [[H3511]] unending, [[H5331]] and my wound [[H4347]] incurable, [[H605]] refusing [[H3985]] to be healed? [[H7495]] You have indeed become [[H1961]] like [[H3644]] a mirage to me— [[H391]] water [[H4325]] that is not [[H3808]] there. [[H539]]

### 19
Therefore [[H3651]] this is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] says: [[H559]] “If [[H518]] you return, [[H7725]] I will restore you; [[H7725]] you will stand [[H5975]] in My presence. [[H6440]] And if [[H518]] you speak [[H3318]] words that are noble [[H3368]] instead of worthless, [[H2151]] you will be [[H1961]] My spokesman. [[H6310]] It is they [[H1992]] who must return [[H7725]] to you, [[H413]] but you [[H859]] must not [[H3808]] return [[H7725]] to them. [[H413]]

### 20
Then I will make you [[H5414]] a wall [[H2346]] to this [[H2088]] people, [[H5971]] a fortified wall [[H1219]] of bronze; [[H5178]] they will fight [[H3898]] against you [[H413]] but will not [[H3808]] overcome you, [[H3201]] for [[H3588]] I [[H589]] am with you [[H854]] to save you [[H3467]] and deliver you. [[H5337]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD. [[H3068]]

### 21
I will deliver you [[H5337]] from the hand [[H3027]] of the wicked [[H7451]] and redeem you [[H6299]] from the grasp [[H3709]] of the ruthless.” [[H6184]]
