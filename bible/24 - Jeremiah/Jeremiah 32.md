###### 1
This is the word [[H1697]] that [[H834]] came [[H1961]] to [[H413]] Jeremiah [[H3414]] from the LORD [[H3068]] in the tenth [[H6224]] year [[H8141]] of Zedekiah [[H6667]] king [[H4428]] of Judah, [[H3063]] which [[H1931]] was the eighteenth [[H8083]] year [[H8141]] of Nebuchadnezzar. [[H5019]]

###### 2
At that time, [[H227]] the army [[H2428]] of the king [[H4428]] of Babylon [[H894]] was besieging [[H6696]] Jerusalem, [[H3389]] and Jeremiah [[H3414]] the prophet [[H5030]] was [[H1961]] imprisoned [[H3607]] in the courtyard [[H2691]] of the guard, [[H4307]] which was [[H834]] in the palace [[H1004]] of the king [[H4428]] of Judah. [[H3063]]

###### 3
For [[H834]] Zedekiah [[H6667]] king [[H4428]] of Judah [[H3063]] had imprisoned him, [[H3607]] saying: [[H559]] “Why [[H4069]] are you [[H859]] prophesying [[H5012]] that [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] says: [[H559]] ‘Behold, [[H2005]] I am about to hand this [[H2063]] city [[H5892]] over to [[H5414]] the king [[H4428]] of Babylon, [[H894]] and he will capture it. [[H3920]]

###### 4
Zedekiah [[H6667]] king [[H4428]] of Judah [[H3063]] will not [[H3808]] escape [[H4422]] from the hands [[H3027]] of the Chaldeans, [[H3778]] but [[H3588]] he will surely be handed over to [[H5414]] the king [[H4428]] of Babylon [[H894]] to speak with him [[H1696]] face [[H6310]] to face [[H6310]] and to see him [[H7200]] eye [[H5869]] to eye. [[H5869]]

###### 5
He will take [[H1980]] Zedekiah [[H6667]] to Babylon, [[H894]] where [[H8033]] he will stay [[H1961]] until [[H5704]] I attend to [[H6485]] him, [[H853]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD. [[H3068]] If [[H3588]] you fight [[H3898]] against [[H854]] the Chaldeans, [[H3778]] you will not [[H3808]] succeed.’” [[H6743]]

###### 6
Jeremiah [[H3414]] replied, [[H559]] “The word [[H1697]] of the LORD [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] to me, [[H413]] saying: [[H559]]

###### 7
Behold! [[H2009]] Hanamel, [[H2601]] the son [[H1121]] of your uncle [[H1730]] Shallum, [[H7967]] is coming [[H935]] to [[H413]] you to say, [[H559]] ‘Buy [[H7069]] for yourself  my field [[H7704]] in Anathoth, [[H6068]] for [[H3588]] you have  the right [[H4941]] of redemption [[H1353]] to buy it.’ [[H7069]]

###### 8
Then, as the LORD [[H3068]] had said, [[H1697]] my cousin [[H1121]] Hanamel [[H2601]] came [[H935]] to me [[H413]] in the courtyard [[H2691]] of the guard [[H4307]] and urged me, [[H559]] ‘Please [[H4994]] buy [[H7069]] my field [[H7704]] in Anathoth [[H6068]] in the land [[H776]] of Benjamin, [[H1144]] for [[H3588]] you own the right [[H4941]] of inheritance [[H3425]] and redemption. [[H1353]] Buy it [[H7069]] for yourself.  Then I knew [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] this [[H1931]] was the word [[H1697]] of the LORD. [[H3068]]

###### 9
So I bought [[H7069]] the field [[H7704]] in Anathoth [[H6068]] from my cousin [[H1121]] Hanamel, [[H2601]] and I weighed out [[H8254]] seventeen [[H7651]] shekels [[H8255]] of silver. [[H3701]]

###### 10
I signed [[H3789]] and sealed [[H2856]] the deed, [[H5612]] called in witnesses, [[H5749]] and weighed out [[H8254]] the silver [[H3701]] on the scales. [[H3976]]

###### 11
Then I took [[H3947]] the deed [[H5612]] of purchase— [[H4736]] the sealed [[H2856]] copy with its terms [[H4687]] and conditions, [[H2706]] as well as [[H853]] the open copy— [[H1540]]

###### 12
and I gave [[H5414]] this deed [[H5612]] to [[H413]] Baruch [[H1263]] son [[H1121]] of Neriah, [[H5374]] the son [[H1121]] of Mahseiah, [[H4271]] in the sight [[H5869]] of my cousin [[H1730]] Hanamel, [[H2601]] the witnesses [[H5707]] who were signing [[H3789]] the purchase [[H4736]] agreement, [[H5612]] and all [[H3605]] the Jews [[H3064]] sitting [[H3427]] in the courtyard [[H2691]] of the guard. [[H4307]]

###### 13
In their sight [[H5869]] I instructed [[H6680]] Baruch, [[H1263]]

###### 14
“This is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts, [[H6635]] the God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] says: [[H559]] Take [[H3947]] these [[H428]] deeds— [[H5612]] both the sealed copy [[H2856]] and the [[H2088]] open [[H1540]] copy [[H5612]] of the [[H2088]] deed [[H5612]] of purchase— [[H4736]] and put them [[H5414]] in a clay [[H2789]] jar [[H3627]] to [[H4616]] preserve them [[H5975]] for a long [[H7227]] time. [[H3117]]

###### 15
For [[H3588]] this is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts, [[H6635]] the God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] says: [[H559]] Houses, [[H1004]] fields, [[H7704]] and vineyards [[H3754]] will again [[H5750]] be bought [[H7069]] in this [[H2063]] land.” [[H776]]

###### 16
After [[H310]] I had given [[H5414]] the deed [[H5612]] of purchase [[H4736]] to [[H413]] Baruch [[H1263]] son [[H1121]] of Neriah, [[H5374]] I prayed [[H6419]] to [[H413]] the LORD: [[H3068]]

###### 17
“Oh, [[H162]] Lord [[H136]] GOD! [[H3068]] You [[H859]] have made [[H6213]] the heavens [[H8064]] and earth [[H776]] by Your great [[H1419]] power [[H3581]] and outstretched [[H5186]] arm. [[H2220]] Nothing [[H3808]] is too difficult [[H6381]] for You! [[H4480]]

###### 18
You show [[H6213]] loving devotion [[H2617]] to thousands, [[H505]] but lay [[H7999]] the sins [[H5771]] of the fathers [[H1]] into [[H413]] the laps [[H2436]] of their children [[H1121]] after them, [[H310]] O great [[H1419]] and mighty [[H1368]] God [[H410]] whose name [[H8034]] is the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts, [[H6635]]

###### 19
the One great [[H1419]] in counsel [[H6098]] and mighty [[H7227]] in deed, [[H5950]] whose [[H834]] eyes [[H5869]] are on [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] the ways [[H1870]] of the sons [[H1121]] of men, [[H120]] to reward [[H5414]] each one [[H376]] according to his ways [[H1870]] and the fruit [[H6529]] of his deeds. [[H4611]]

###### 20
You performed [[H7760]] signs [[H226]] and wonders [[H4159]] in the land [[H776]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] and You do so to [[H5704]] this very [[H2088]] day, [[H3117]] both in Israel [[H3478]] and among all mankind. [[H120]] And You have made [[H6213]] a name for Yourself, [[H8034]] as is the case [[H2088]] to this day. [[H3117]]

###### 21
You brought Your people [[H5971]] Israel [[H3478]] out [[H3318]] of Egypt [[H4714]] with signs [[H226]] and wonders, [[H4159]] with a strong [[H2389]] hand [[H3027]] and outstretched [[H5186]] arm, [[H248]] and with great [[H1419]] terror. [[H4172]]

###### 22
You gave [[H5414]] them this [[H2063]] land [[H776]] You had sworn [[H7650]] to give [[H5414]] their forefathers, [[H1]] a land [[H776]] flowing [[H2100]] with milk [[H2461]] and honey. [[H1706]]

###### 23
They came in [[H935]] and possessed it, [[H3423]] but they did not [[H3808]] obey [[H8085]] Your voice [[H6963]] or walk [[H1980]] in Your law. [[H8451]] They failed [[H3808]] to perform [[H6213]] all [[H3605]] You commanded [[H6680]] them to do, [[H6213]] and so You have brought [[H7122]] upon them [[H853]] all [[H3605]] this [[H2063]] disaster. [[H7451]]

###### 24
See how [[H2009]] the siege ramps [[H5550]] are mounted [[H935]] against the city [[H5892]] to capture it. [[H3920]] And by [[H6440]] sword, [[H2719]] famine, [[H7458]] and plague, [[H1698]] the city [[H5892]] has been given [[H5414]] into the hand [[H3027]] of the Chaldeans [[H3778]] who are fighting [[H3898]] against it. [[H5921]] What [[H834]] You have spoken [[H1696]] has happened, [[H1961]] as You [[H2005]] now see! [[H7200]]

###### 25
Yet You, [[H859]] O Lord [[H136]] GOD, [[H3069]] have said [[H559]] to me, [[H413]] ‘Buy [[H7069]] for yourself  the field [[H7704]] with silver [[H3701]] and call in [[H5749]] witnesses, [[H5707]] even though the city [[H5892]] has been handed over to [[H5414]] the Chaldeans!’” [[H3778]]

###### 26
Then the word [[H1697]] of the LORD [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] to [[H413]] Jeremiah: [[H3414]]

###### 27
“Behold, [[H2009]] I [[H589]] am the LORD, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of all [[H3605]] flesh. [[H1320]] Is anything [[H3605]] too difficult [[H6381]] for Me? [[H4480]]

###### 28
Therefore, [[H3651]] this is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] says: [[H559]] I am about to hand this [[H2063]] city [[H5892]] over to [[H5414]] the Chaldeans [[H3778]] and to [[H3027]] Nebuchadnezzar [[H5019]] king [[H4428]] of Babylon, [[H894]] who will capture it. [[H3920]]

###### 29
And the Chaldeans [[H3778]] who are fighting [[H3898]] against [[H5921]] this [[H2063]] city [[H5892]] will come in, [[H935]] set [[H2063]] [it] [[H5892]] on fire, [[H3341]] and burn it, [[H8313]] along with [[H854]] the houses [[H1004]] of those who [[H834]] provoked Me to anger [[H3707]] by burning incense [[H6999]] to Baal [[H1168]] on [[H5921]] their rooftops [[H1406]] and by pouring out [[H5258]] drink offerings [[H5262]] to other [[H312]] gods. [[H430]]

###### 30
For [[H3588]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] and [[H1121]] of Judah [[H3063]] have done [[H6213]] nothing but [[H389]] evil [[H7451]] in My sight [[H5869]] from their youth; [[H5271]] indeed, [[H3588]] [they] [[H1121]] have done nothing but [[H389]] provoke Me to anger [[H3707]] by the work [[H4639]] of their hands, [[H3027]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD. [[H3068]]

###### 31
For [[H3588]] this [[H2063]] city [[H5892]] has aroused My wrath [[H639]] and fury [[H2534]] from [[H4480]] the day [[H3117]] it was built [[H1129]] until now. [[H5704]] Therefore I will remove it [[H5493]] from [[H5921]] My presence [[H6440]]

###### 32
because of [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] the evil [[H7451]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] and [[H1121]] of Judah [[H3063]] have done [[H6213]] to provoke Me to anger— [[H3707]] they, [[H1992]] their kings, [[H4428]] their officials, [[H8269]] their priests [[H3548]] and prophets, [[H5030]] the men [[H376]] of Judah, [[H3063]] and the residents [[H3427]] of Jerusalem. [[H3389]]

###### 33
They have turned [[H6437]] their backs [[H6203]] to [[H413]] Me and not [[H3808]] their faces. [[H6440]] Though I taught [[H3925]] them [[H853]] again and again, [[H7925]] they would not [[H369]] listen [[H8085]] or respond [[H3947]] to discipline. [[H4148]]

###### 34
They have placed [[H7760]] their abominations [[H8251]] in the house [[H1004]] that [[H834]] bears [[H7121]] My name, [[H8034]] and so [[H5921]] have defiled it. [[H2930]]

###### 35
They have built [[H1129]] the high places [[H1116]] of Baal [[H1168]] in the Valley of Hinnom [[H1516]] to make their sons [[H1121]] and daughters [[H1323]] pass through [[H5674]] the fire to Molech— [[H4432]] something [[H834]] I never [[H3808]] commanded them, [[H6680]] nor had it ever [[H3808]] entered [[H5927]] My mind, [[H3820]] that they should commit [[H6213]] such [[H2063]] an abomination [[H8441]] and cause Judah [[H3063]] to sin. [[H2398]]

###### 36
Now [[H6258]] therefore, [[H3651]] about [[H413]] this [[H2063]] city [[H5892]] of which [[H834]] you [[H859]] say, [[H559]] ‘It is given [[H5414]] into the hand [[H3027]] of the king [[H4428]] of Babylon [[H894]] by sword [[H2719]] and famine [[H7458]] and plague,’ [[H1698]] this is what [[H3541]] the LORD, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] says: [[H559]]

###### 37
I will surely gather [My people] [[H6908]] from all [[H3605]] the lands [[H776]] to which [[H834]] I have banished them [[H5080]] in My furious anger [[H639]] and great [[H1419]] wrath, [[H7110]] and I will return [[H7725]] them to [[H413]] this [[H2088]] place [[H4725]] and make them dwell [[H3427]] in safety. [[H983]]

###### 38
They will be [[H1961]] My people, [[H5971]] and I [[H589]] will be [[H1961]] their God. [[H430]]

###### 39
I will give [[H5414]] them one [[H259]] heart [[H3820]] and one [[H259]] way, [[H1870]] so that they will always fear Me [[H3372]] for their own good [[H2896]] and for the good of their children [[H1121]] after them. [[H310]]

###### 40
I will make [[H3772]] an everlasting [[H5769]] covenant with them: [[H1285]] I will never [[H3808]] turn away [[H7725]] from [[H310]] doing good to them, [[H3190]] and I will put [[H5414]] My fear [[H3374]] in their hearts [[H3824]] so that they will never [[H1115]] turn away [[H5493]] from Me. [[H5921]]

###### 41
Yes, I will rejoice [[H7797]] in [[H5921]] doing them good, [[H2895]] and I will faithfully [[H571]] plant [[H5193]] them in this [[H2063]] land [[H776]] with all [[H3605]] My heart [[H5315]] and soul. [[H3820]]

###### 42
For [[H3588]] this is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] says: [[H559]] Just as [[H834]] I have brought [[H935]] all [[H3605]] this [[H2063]] great [[H1419]] disaster [[H7451]] on [[H413]] this [[H2088]] people, [[H5971]] so [[H3651]] I will [[H595]] bring [[H935]] on [[H5921]] them [[H853]] all [[H3605]] the good [[H2896]] I [[H595]] have promised [[H1696]] them. [[H5921]]

###### 43
And fields [[H7704]] will be bought [[H7069]] in this [[H2063]] land [[H776]] about which [[H834]] you [[H859]] are saying, [[H559]] ‘It is [[H1931]] a desolation, [[H8077]] without [[H369]] man [[H120]] or beast; [[H929]] it has been handed over to [[H5414]] the Chaldeans.’ [[H3778]]

###### 44
Fields [[H7704]] will be purchased [[H7069]] with silver, [[H3701]] and deeds [[H5612]] will be signed, [[H3789]] sealed, [[H2856]] and witnessed [[H5707]] in the land [[H776]] of Benjamin, [[H1144]] in the areas surrounding [[H5439]] Jerusalem, [[H3389]] and in the cities [[H5892]] of Judah— [[H3063]] the cities [[H5892]] of the hill country, [[H2022]] the foothills, [[H8219]] [and] [[H5892]] the Negev— [[H5045]] because [[H3588]] I will restore them [[H7725]] from captivity, [[H7622]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD. [[H3068]]
