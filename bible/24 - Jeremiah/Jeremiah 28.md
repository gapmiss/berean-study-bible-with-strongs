### 1
In the fifth [[H2549]] month [[H2320]] of that same [[H1931]] year, [[H8141]] the fourth [[H7243]] year, [[H8141]] near the beginning [[H7225]] of the reign [[H4467]] of King [[H4428]] Zedekiah [[H6667]] of Judah, [[H3063]] the prophet [[H5030]] Hananiah [[H2608]] son [[H1121]] of Azzur [[H5809]] of Gibeon, [[H1391]] said [[H559]] to me [[H413]] in the house [[H1004]] of the LORD [[H3068]] in the presence [[H5869]] of the priests [[H3548]] and all [[H3605]] the people: [[H5971]]

### 2
“This is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts, [[H6635]] the God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] says: [[H559]] ‘I have broken [[H7665]] the yoke [[H5923]] of the king [[H4428]] of Babylon. [[H894]]

### 3
Within two years [[H8141]] I [[H589]] will restore [[H7725]] to [[H413]] this [[H2088]] place [[H4725]] all [[H3605]] the articles [[H3627]] of the house [[H1004]] of the LORD [[H3068]] that [[H834]] King [[H4428]] Nebuchadnezzar [[H5019]] of Babylon [[H894]] removed [[H3947]] from [[H4480]] here [[H2088]] and carried [[H935]] to Babylon. [[H894]]

### 4
And I [[H589]] will restore [[H7725]] to [[H413]] this [[H2088]] place [[H4725]] Jeconiah [[H3204]] son [[H1121]] of Jehoiakim [[H3079]] king [[H4428]] of Judah, [[H3063]] along with [[H854]] all [[H3605]] the exiles [[H1546]] from Judah [[H3063]] who went [[H935]] to Babylon,’ [[H894]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD, [[H3068]] ‘for [[H3588]] I will break [[H7665]] the yoke [[H5923]] of the king [[H4428]] of Babylon.’ [[H894]]

### 5
Then the prophet [[H5030]] Jeremiah [[H3414]] replied [[H559]] to [[H413]] the prophet [[H5030]] Hananiah [[H2608]] in the presence [[H5869]] of the priests [[H3548]] and all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] who were standing [[H5975]] in the temple [[H1004]] of the LORD. [[H3068]]

### 6
“Amen!” [[H543]] Jeremiah [[H3414]] said. [[H559]] “May the LORD [[H3069]] do [[H6213]] so! [[H3651]] May the LORD [[H3069]] fulfill [[H6965]] the words [[H1697]] you have prophesied, [[H5012]] and may He restore [[H7725]] the articles [[H3627]] of [His] [[H3069]] house [[H1004]] and all [[H3605]] the exiles [[H1473]] back [[H413]] to this [[H2088]] place [[H4725]] from Babylon. [[H894]]

### 7
Nevertheless, [[H389]] listen [[H8085]] now [[H4994]] to this [[H2088]] message [[H1697]] I [[H595]] am speaking [[H1696]] in your hearing [[H241]] and in the hearing [[H241]] of all [[H3605]] the people. [[H5971]]

### 8
The prophets [[H5030]] of old [[H5769]] who [[H834]] preceded [[H1961]] you [[H4480]] and me [[H6440]] prophesied [[H5012]] war, [[H4421]] disaster, [[H7451]] and plague [[H1698]] against [[H413]] many [[H7227]] lands [[H776]] and great [[H1419]] kingdoms. [[H4467]]

### 9
As for the prophet [[H5030]] who [[H834]] prophesies [[H5012]] peace, [[H7965]] only if the word [[H1697]] of the prophet [[H5030]] comes true [[H935]] will the prophet [[H5030]] be recognized [[H3045]] as one the LORD [[H3068]] has truly [[H571]] sent.” [[H7971]]

### 10
Then the prophet [[H5030]] Hananiah [[H2608]] took [[H3947]] the yoke [[H4133]] off [[H5921]] the neck [[H6677]] of Jeremiah [[H3414]] the prophet [[H5030]] and broke it. [[H7665]]

### 11
And in the presence [[H5869]] of all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] Hananiah [[H2608]] proclaimed, [[H559]] “This is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] says: [[H559]] ‘In this way, [[H3602]] within two years [[H8141]] I will break [[H7665]] the yoke [[H5923]] of King [[H4428]] Nebuchadnezzar [[H5019]] of Babylon [[H894]] off [[H5921]] the neck [[H6677]] of all [[H3605]] the nations.’” [[H1471]] At this, Jeremiah [[H3414]] the prophet [[H5030]] went [[H1980]] on his way. [[H1870]]

### 12
But shortly after [[H310]] Hananiah [[H2608]] the prophet [[H5030]] had broken [[H7665]] the yoke [[H4133]] off [[H5921]] [his] neck, [[H6677]] the word [[H1697]] of the LORD [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] to [[H413]] Jeremiah: [[H3414]]

### 13
“Go [[H1980]] and tell [[H559]] Hananiah [[H2608]] that this is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] says: [[H559]] ‘You have broken [[H7665]] a yoke [[H4133]] of wood, [[H6086]] but in its place [[H8478]] you have fashioned [[H6213]] a yoke [[H4133]] of iron.’ [[H1270]]

### 14
For [[H3588]] this is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts, [[H6635]] the God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] says: [[H559]] ‘I have put [[H5414]] a yoke [[H5923]] of iron [[H1270]] on [[H5921]] the neck [[H6677]] of all [[H3605]] these [[H428]] nations [[H1471]] to make them serve [[H5647]] King [[H4428]] Nebuchadnezzar [[H5019]] of Babylon, [[H894]] and they will serve him. [[H5647]] I have even [[H1571]] given him control [[H5414]] of the beasts [[H2416]] of the field. [[H7704]]

### 15
Then the prophet [[H5030]] Jeremiah [[H3414]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] the prophet [[H5030]] Hananiah, [[H2608]] “Listen, [[H8085]] Hananiah! [[H2608]] The LORD [[H3068]] did not [[H3808]] send you, [[H7971]] but you [[H859]] have persuaded [[H2088]] this people [[H5971]] to trust [[H982]] in [[H5921]] a lie. [[H8267]]

### 16
Therefore, [[H3651]] this is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] says: [[H559]] ‘I am about to remove you [[H7971]] from [[H5921]] the face [[H6440]] of the earth. [[H127]] You [[H859]] will die [[H4191]] this year [[H8141]] because [[H3588]] you have preached [[H1696]] rebellion [[H5627]] against [[H413]] the LORD.’” [[H3068]]

### 17
And in the seventh [[H7637]] month [[H2320]] of that very [[H1931]] year, [[H8141]] the prophet [[H5030]] Hananiah [[H2608]] died. [[H4191]]
