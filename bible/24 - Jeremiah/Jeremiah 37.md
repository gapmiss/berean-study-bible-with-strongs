### 1
Nebuchadnezzar [[H5019]] king [[H4428]] of Babylon [[H894]] named [[H834]] Zedekiah [[H6667]] son [[H1121]] of Josiah [[H2977]] the king [[H4427]] of Judah, [[H3063]] and he reigned [[H4427]] in place [[H8478]] of Coniah [[H3659]] son [[H1121]] of Jehoiakim. [[H3079]]

### 2
He [[H1931]] and his officers [[H5650]] and the people [[H5971]] of the land [[H776]] refused [[H3808]] to obey [[H8085]] the words [[H1697]] that the LORD [[H3068]] had spoken [[H1696]] through [[H3027]] Jeremiah [[H3414]] the prophet. [[H5030]]

### 3
Yet King [[H4428]] Zedekiah [[H6667]] sent [[H7971]] Jehucal [[H3081]] son [[H1121]] of Shelemiah [[H8018]] and Zephaniah [[H6846]] the priest, [[H3548]] the son [[H1121]] of Maaseiah, [[H4641]] to [[H413]] Jeremiah [[H3414]] the prophet [[H5030]] with the message, [[H559]] “Please [[H4994]] pray [[H6419]] for us [[H5704]] to [[H413]] the LORD [[H3068]] our God!” [[H430]]

### 4
Now Jeremiah [[H3414]] was free to come [[H935]] and go [[H3318]] among [[H8432]] the people, [[H5971]] for they had not [[H3808]] yet put [[H5414]] him into the prison. [[H1004]]

### 5
Pharaoh’s [[H6547]] army [[H2428]] had left [[H3318]] Egypt, [[H4714]] and when the Chaldeans [[H3778]] who were besieging [[H6696]] Jerusalem [[H3389]] heard [[H8085]] the report, [[H8088]] they withdrew [[H5927]] from [[H5921]] Jerusalem. [[H3389]]

### 6
Then the word [[H1697]] of the LORD [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] to [[H413]] Jeremiah [[H3414]] the prophet: [[H5030]]

### 7
“This is what [[H3541]] the LORD, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] says: [[H559]] Tell [[H559]] the king [[H4428]] of Judah, [[H3063]] who is sending [[H7971]] you [[H853]] to inquire [[H1875]] of Me, [[H413]] ‘Behold, [[H2009]] Pharaoh’s [[H6547]] army, [[H2428]] which has marched out [[H3318]] to help you, [[H5833]] is going back [[H7725]] to its own land [[H776]] of Egypt. [[H4714]]

### 8
Then the Chaldeans [[H3778]] will return [[H7725]] and fight [[H3898]] against [[H5921]] this [[H2063]] city. [[H5892]] They will capture [[H3920]] it and burn it down.’ [[H8313]]

### 9
This is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] says: [[H559]] Do not [[H408]] deceive [[H5377]] yourselves [[H5315]] by saying, [[H559]] ‘The Chaldeans [[H3778]] will go away for good,’ [[H1980]] for [[H3588]] they will not! [[H3808]]

### 10
Indeed, [[H3588]] if [[H518]] you were to strike down [[H5221]] the entire [[H3605]] army [[H2428]] of the Chaldeans [[H3778]] that is fighting [[H3898]] against you [[H854]] and only wounded [[H1856]] men [[H376]] remained [[H7604]] in their tents, [[H168]] they would still get up [[H6965]] and burn this [[H2063]] city [[H5892]] down.” [[H8313]]

### 11
When the Chaldean [[H3778]] army [[H2428]] withdrew [[H5927]] from [[H5921]] Jerusalem [[H3389]] for fear [[H6440]] of Pharaoh’s [[H6547]] army, [[H2428]]

### 12
Jeremiah [[H3414]] started to leave [[H3318]] Jerusalem [[H3389]] to go [[H1980]] to the land [[H776]] of Benjamin [[H1144]] to claim his portion [[H2505]] there [[H8033]] among [[H8432]] the people. [[H5971]]

### 13
But when he [[H1931]] reached [[H1961]] the Gate [[H8179]] of Benjamin, [[H1144]] the captain [[H1167]] of the guard, [[H6488]] whose name [[H8034]] was Irijah [[H3376]] son [[H1121]] of Shelemiah, [[H8018]] the son [[H1121]] of Hananiah, [[H2608]] seized [[H8610]] [him] [[H3414]] and said, [[H559]] “You [[H859]] are deserting [[H5307]] to [[H413]] the Chaldeans!” [[H3778]]

### 14
“That is a lie,” [[H8267]] Jeremiah [[H3414]] replied. [[H559]] “I am not [[H369]] deserting [[H5307]] to [[H5921]] the Chaldeans!” [[H3778]] But Irijah [[H3376]] would not [[H3808]] listen [[H8085]] to him; [[H413]] instead, he arrested [[H8610]] Jeremiah [[H3414]] and took [[H935]] him to [[H413]] the officials. [[H8269]]

### 15
The officials [[H8269]] were angry [[H7107]] with [[H5921]] Jeremiah, [[H3414]] and they beat [[H5221]] him [[H853]] and placed [[H5414]] him [[H853]] in jail [[H1004]] in the house [[H1004]] of Jonathan [[H3083]] the scribe, [[H5608]] for [[H3588]] it had been made [[H6213]] into a prison. [[H1004]]

### 16
So [[H3588]] Jeremiah [[H3414]] went [[H935]] into [[H413]] a cell [[H1004]] in [[H413]] the dungeon [[H2588]] and remained [[H3427]] there [[H8033]] a long time. [[H7227]]

### 17
Later, King [[H4428]] Zedekiah [[H6667]] sent for him [[H7971]] and received him, [[H3947]] and in his palace [[H1004]] he privately [[H5643]] asked, [[H7592]] “Is there [[H3426]] a word [[H1697]] from the LORD?” [[H3068]] “There is,” [[H3426]] Jeremiah [[H3414]] replied. [[H559]] “You will be handed over to [[H3027]] the king [[H4428]] of Babylon.” [[H894]]

### 18
Then Jeremiah [[H3414]] asked [[H559]] King [[H4428]] Zedekiah, [[H6667]] “How [[H4100]] have I sinned [[H2398]] against you  or your servants [[H5650]] or these [[H2088]] people, [[H5971]] that [[H3588]] you have put [[H5414]] me in [[H413]] prison? [[H1004]]

### 19
Where [[H346]] are your prophets, [[H5030]] who [[H834]] prophesied to you, [[H5012]] claiming, [[H559]] ‘The king [[H4428]] of Babylon [[H894]] will not [[H3808]] come [[H935]] against you [[H5921]] or this [[H2063]] land’? [[H776]]

### 20
But now [[H6258]] please [[H4994]] listen, [[H8085]] O my lord [[H113]] the king. [[H4428]] May my petition [[H8467]] come [[H5307]] before you. [[H6440]] Do not [[H408]] send me back [[H7725]] to the house [[H1004]] of Jonathan [[H3083]] the scribe, [[H5608]] or [[H3808]] I will die [[H4191]] there.” [[H8033]]

### 21
So King [[H4428]] Zedekiah [[H6667]] gave orders, [[H6680]] and Jeremiah [[H3414]] was placed [[H6485]] in the courtyard [[H2691]] of the guard [[H4307]] and given [[H5414]] a loaf [[H3603]] of bread [[H3899]] daily [[H3117]] from [[H4480]] the baker’s [[H644]] street, [[H2351]] until [[H5704]] all [[H3605]] the bread [[H3899]] in the city [[H5892]] was gone. [[H8552]] So Jeremiah [[H3414]] remained [[H3427]] in the courtyard [[H2691]] of the guard. [[H4307]]
