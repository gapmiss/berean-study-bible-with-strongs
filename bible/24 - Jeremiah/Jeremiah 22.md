### 1
This is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] says: [[H559]] “Go down [[H3381]] to the palace [[H1004]] of the king [[H4428]] of Judah [[H3063]] and proclaim [[H1696]] this [[H2088]] message [[H1697]] there, [[H8033]]

### 2
saying, [[H559]] ‘Hear [[H8085]] the word [[H1697]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] O king [[H4428]] of Judah, [[H3063]] who sits [[H3427]] on [[H5921]] the throne [[H3678]] of David— [[H1732]] you [[H859]] and your officials [[H5650]] and your people [[H5971]] who enter [[H935]] these [[H428]] gates. [[H8179]]

### 3
This is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] says: [[H559]] Administer [[H6213]] justice [[H4941]] and righteousness. [[H6666]] Rescue [[H5337]] the victim of robbery [[H1497]] from the hand [[H3027]] of his oppressor. [[H6216]] Do no [[H408]] wrong [[H3238]] or violence [[H2554]] to the foreigner, [[H1616]] the fatherless, [[H3490]] or the widow. [[H490]] Do not [[H408]] shed [[H8210]] innocent [[H5355]] blood [[H1818]] in this [[H2088]] place. [[H4725]]

### 4
For [[H3588]] if [[H518]] you will indeed [[H6213]] carry out [[H6213]] these [[H2088]] commands, [[H1697]] then kings [[H4428]] who sit [[H3427]] on [[H5921]] David’s [[H1732]] throne [[H3678]] will enter [[H935]] through the gates [[H8179]] of this [[H2088]] palace [[H1004]] riding [[H7392]] on chariots [[H7393]] and horses— [[H5483]] they [[H1931]] and their officials [[H5650]] and their people. [[H5971]]

### 5
But if [[H518]] you do not [[H3808]] obey [[H8085]] these [[H428]] words, [[H1697]] then I swear by Myself, [[H7650]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD, [[H3068]] that [[H3588]] this [[H2088]] house [[H1004]] will become [[H1961]] a pile of rubble.’” [[H2723]]

### 6
For [[H3588]] this is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] says [[H559]] concerning [[H5921]] the house [[H1004]] of the king [[H4428]] of Judah: [[H3063]] “You [[H859]] are like Gilead to Me, [[H1568]] like the summit [[H7218]] of Lebanon; [[H3844]] but I will certainly [[H518]] turn you [[H7896]] into a desert, [[H4057]] like cities [[H5892]] that are uninhabited. [[H3808]]

### 7
I will appoint [[H6942]] destroyers [[H7843]] against you, [[H5921]] each man [[H376]] with his weapons, [[H3627]] and they will cut down [[H3772]] the choicest [[H4005]] of your cedars [[H730]] and throw [[H5307]] them into [[H5921]] the fire. [[H784]]

### 8
And many [[H7227]] nations [[H1471]] will pass [[H5674]] by [[H5921]] this [[H2063]] city [[H5892]] and ask [[H559]] one [[H376]] another, [[H7453]] ‘Why [[H5921]] has the LORD [[H3068]] done [[H6213]] such a thing [[H3602]] to this [[H2063]] great [[H1419]] city?’ [[H5892]]

### 9
Then [people] will reply, [[H559]] ‘Because [[H5921]] they have forsaken [[H5800]] the covenant [[H1285]] of the LORD [[H3068]] their God [[H430]] and have worshiped [[H7812]] and served [[H5647]] other [[H312]] gods.’ [[H430]]

### 10
Do not [[H408]] weep [[H1058]] for the dead [king]; [[H4191]] do not [[H408]] mourn his loss. [[H5110]] Weep [[H1058]] bitterly [[H1058]] for the one who is exiled, [[H1980]] for [[H3588]] he will never [[H3808]] return [[H7725]] to see [[H7200]] his native [[H4138]] land. [[H776]]

### 11
For [[H3588]] this is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] says [[H559]] concerning [[H413]] Shallum [[H7967]] son [[H1121]] of Josiah, [[H2977]] king [[H4428]] of Judah, [[H3063]] who succeeded [[H4427]] his father [[H1]] Josiah [[H2977]] [but] has gone forth [[H3318]] from [[H4480]] this [[H2088]] place: [[H4725]] ‘He will never [[H3808]] return, [[H7725]]

### 12
but [[H3588]] he will die [[H4191]] in the place [[H4725]] to which [[H834]] he was exiled; [[H1540]] he will never [[H3808]] see [[H7200]] this [[H2063]] land [[H776]] again.’” [[H5750]]

### 13
“Woe [[H1945]] to him who builds [[H1129]] his palace [[H1004]] by [[H3808]] unrighteousness, [[H6664]] and his upper rooms [[H5944]] without [[H3808]] justice, [[H4941]] who makes his countrymen [[H7453]] serve [[H5647]] without pay, [[H2600]] and will not [[H3808]] give [[H5414]] him  his wages, [[H6467]]

### 14
who says, [[H559]] ‘I will build [[H1129]] myself  a great [[H4060]] palace, [[H1004]] with spacious [[H7304]] upper rooms.’ [[H5944]] So he cuts [[H7167]] windows in it, [[H2474]] panels it [[H5603]] with cedar, [[H730]] and paints it [[H4886]] with vermilion. [[H8350]]

### 15
Are you a king [[H4427]] because [[H3588]] you [[H859]] excel [[H8474]] in cedar? [[H730]] Did not [[H3808]] your father [[H1]] eat [[H398]] and drink [[H8354]] and administer [[H6213]] justice [[H4941]] and righteousness? [[H6666]] Then [[H227]] it went well with him. [[H2896]]

### 16
He took up [[H1777]] the cause [[H1779]] of the poor [[H6041]] and needy, [[H34]] and so [[H227]] it went well. [[H2896]] Is this [[H1931]] not [[H3808]] what it means to know [[H1847]] Me?” [[H853]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD. [[H3068]]

### 17
“But [[H3588]] your eyes [[H5869]] and heart [[H3820]] [are set on] nothing [[H369]] except [[H3588]] your own dishonest gain, [[H1215]] on shedding [[H8210]] innocent [[H5355]] blood, [[H1818]] on practicing [[H6213]] extortion [[H6233]] and oppression.” [[H4835]]

### 18
Therefore, [[H3651]] this is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] says [[H559]] concerning [[H413]] Jehoiakim [[H3079]] son [[H1121]] of Josiah [[H2977]] king [[H4428]] of Judah: [[H3063]] “They will not [[H3808]] mourn [[H5594]] for him:  ‘Alas, [[H1945]] my brother! [[H251]] Alas, [[H1945]] my sister!’ [[H269]] They will not [[H3808]] mourn [[H5594]] for him:  ‘Alas, [[H1945]] for the master! [[H113]] Alas, [[H1945]] for his splendor!’ [[H1935]]

### 19
He will be buried [[H6912]] like a donkey, [[H2543]] dragged away [[H5498]] and thrown [[H7993]] outside [[H1973]] the gates [[H8179]] of Jerusalem. [[H3389]]

### 20
Go up [[H5927]] to Lebanon [[H3844]] and cry out; [[H6817]] raise [[H5414]] your voice [[H6963]] in Bashan; [[H1316]] cry out [[H6817]] from Abarim, [[H5682]] for [[H3588]] all [[H3605]] your lovers [[H157]] have been crushed. [[H7665]]

### 21
I warned [[H1696]] you [[H413]] when you were secure. [[H7962]] You said, [[H559]] ‘I will not [[H3808]] listen.’ [[H8085]] This [[H2088]] has been your way [[H1870]] from youth, [[H5271]] that [[H3588]] you have not [[H3808]] you obeyed [[H8085]] My voice. [[H6963]]

### 22
The wind [[H7307]] will drive away [[H7462]] all [[H3605]] your shepherds, [[H7462]] and your lovers [[H157]] will go [[H1980]] into captivity. [[H7628]] Then [[H227]] you will be ashamed [[H954]] and humiliated [[H3637]] because of all [[H3605]] your wickedness. [[H7451]]

### 23
O inhabitant [[H3427]] of Lebanon, [[H3844]] nestled [[H7077]] in the cedars, [[H730]] how [[H4100]] you will groan [[H2603]] when pangs of anguish [[H2256]] come upon you, [[H935]] agony [[H2427]] like a woman in labor.” [[H3205]]

### 24
“As surely as I [[H589]] live,” [[H2416]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD, [[H3068]] “even [[H3588]] if [[H518]] you, Coniah [[H3659]] son [[H1121]] of Jehoiakim [[H3079]] king [[H4428]] of Judah, [[H3063]] were [[H1961]] a signet ring [[H2368]] on [[H5921]] My right [[H3225]] hand, [[H3027]] I would pull you [[H5423]] off. [[H8033]]

### 25
And I will hand you over [[H5414]] to those [[H834]] you [[H859]] dread, [[H3016]] who want to take [[H1245]] your life— [[H5315]] to Nebuchadnezzar [[H5019]] king [[H4428]] of Babylon [[H894]] and the Chaldeans. [[H3778]]

### 26
I will hurl [[H2904]] you [[H853]] and [[H853]] the mother [[H517]] who [[H834]] gave you birth [[H3205]] into [[H5921]] another [[H312]] land, [[H776]] where [[H834]] neither [[H3808]] of you were born— [[H3205]] and there [[H8033]] you will both die. [[H4191]]

### 27
[You] will never [[H3808]] return [[H7725]] to [[H5921]] the land [[H776]] for which [you] [[H1992]] long.” [[H5375]]

### 28
Is this [[H2088]] man [[H376]] Coniah [[H3659]] a despised [[H959]] [and] shattered [[H5310]] pot, [[H6089]] a jar [[H3627]] that no [[H369]] one wants? [[H2656]] Why [[H4069]] are he [[H1931]] and his descendants [[H2233]] hurled out [[H2904]] and cast [[H7993]] into [[H5921]] a land [[H776]] they do not [[H3808]] know? [[H3045]]

### 29
O land, [[H776]] land, [[H776]] land, [[H776]] hear [[H8085]] the word [[H1697]] of the LORD! [[H3069]]

### 30
This is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] says: [[H559]] “Enroll [[H3789]] this [[H2088]] man [[H376]] as childless, [[H6185]] a man [[H1397]] who will not [[H3808]] prosper [[H6743]] in his lifetime. [[H3117]] None [[H3808]] of his descendants [[H2233]] will prosper [[H6743]] to sit [[H3427]] on [[H5921]] the throne [[H3678]] of David [[H1732]] or to rule [[H4910]] again [[H5750]] in Judah.” [[H3063]]
