###### 1
Now Shephatiah [[H8203]] son [[H1121]] of Mattan, [[H4977]] Gedaliah [[H1436]] son [[H1121]] of Pashhur, [[H6583]] Jucal [[H3116]] son [[H1121]] of Shelemiah, [[H8018]] and Pashhur [[H6583]] son [[H1121]] of Malchijah [[H4441]] heard [[H8085]] the words [[H1697]] Jeremiah [[H3414]] was telling [[H1696]] all [[H3605]] the people: [[H5971]]

###### 2
“This is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] says: [[H559]] Whoever stays [[H3427]] in this [[H2063]] city [[H5892]] will die [[H4191]] by sword, [[H2719]] famine, [[H7458]] and plague, [[H1698]] but whoever surrenders [[H3318]] to [[H413]] the Chaldeans [[H3778]] will live. [[H2421]] He will escape [[H1961]] with his life [[H5315]] as a reward [[H7998]] and will live. [[H2421]]

###### 3
This is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] says: [[H559]] This [[H2063]] city [[H5892]] will surely be handed over [[H5414]] to the army [[H2428]] of the king [[H4428]] of Babylon, [[H894]] and he will capture it.” [[H3920]]

###### 4
Then the officials [[H8269]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] the king, [[H4428]] “This [[H2088]] man [[H376]] ought to die, [[H4191]] for [[H3588]] he [[H1931]] is discouraging [[H7503]] the warriors [[H376]] who remain [[H7604]] in this [[H2063]] city, [[H5892]] as well as all [[H3605]] the people, [[H5971]] by speaking [[H1696]] such [[H428]] words [[H1697]] to them; [[H413]] this [[H2088]] man [[H376]] is not [[H369]] seeking [[H1875]] the well-being [[H7965]] of these [[H2088]] people, [[H5971]] but [[H3588]] their ruin. [[H7451]]

###### 5
“Here [[H2009]] he is,” [[H1931]] replied [[H559]] King [[H4428]] Zedekiah. [[H6667]] “He is in your hands, [[H3027]] since [[H3588]] the king [[H4428]] can do nothing [[H369]] to stop you.” [[H1697]]

###### 6
So they took [[H3947]] Jeremiah [[H3414]] and dropped [[H7993]] him into [[H413]] the cistern [[H953]] of Malchiah, [[H4441]] the king’s [[H4429]] son, [[H1121]] which [[H834]] was in the courtyard [[H2691]] of the guard. [[H4307]] They lowered [[H7971]] Jeremiah [[H3414]] with ropes [[H2256]] into the cistern, [[H953]] which had no [[H369]] water [[H4325]] but only [[H3588]] mud, [[H2916]] and Jeremiah [[H3414]] sank down [[H2883]] into the mud. [[H2916]]

###### 7
Now Ebed-melech [[H5663]] the Cushite, [[H3569]] a court official [[H5631]] in the royal [[H4428]] palace, [[H1004]] heard [[H8085]] that Jeremiah [[H3414]] had been put [[H5414]] into [[H413]] the cistern. [[H953]] While the king [[H4428]] was sitting [[H3427]] at the Gate [[H8179]] of Benjamin, [[H1144]]

###### 8
Ebed-melech [[H5663]] went out [[H3318]] from the king’s [[H4428]] palace [[H1004]] and said [[H1696]] to [[H413]] the king, [[H4428]]

###### 9
“My lord [[H113]] the king, [[H4428]] these [[H428]] men [[H376]] have acted wickedly [[H7489]] in all that [[H3605]] they have done [[H6213]] to Jeremiah [[H3414]] the prophet. [[H5030]] They have dropped [[H7993]] him [[H834]] into [[H413]] the cistern, [[H953]] where [[H8478]] he will starve to death, [[H4191]] for [[H3588]] there is no [[H369]] more [[H5750]] bread [[H3899]] in the city.” [[H5892]]

###### 10
So the king [[H4428]] commanded [[H6680]] Ebed-melech [[H5663]] the Cushite, [[H3569]] “Take [[H3947]] thirty [[H7970]] men [[H376]] from [[H4480]] here [[H2088]] with you [[H3027]] and pull [[H5927]] Jeremiah [[H3414]] the prophet [[H5030]] out of the cistern [[H953]] before [[H2962]] he dies.” [[H4191]]

###### 11
Then Ebed-melech [[H5663]] took [[H3947]] the men [[H376]] with him [[H3027]] and went [[H935]] to the king’s [[H4428]] palace, [[H1004]] to [[H413]] a place below [[H8478]] the storehouse. [[H214]] From there [[H8033]] he took [[H3947]] old [[H1094]] rags [[H5499]] and worn-out [[H1094]] clothes [[H4418]] and lowered them [[H7971]] with ropes [[H2256]] to [[H413]] Jeremiah [[H3414]] in [[H413]] the cistern. [[H953]]

###### 12
Ebed-melech [[H5663]] the Cushite [[H3569]] cried out [[H559]] to [[H413]] Jeremiah, [[H3414]] “Put [[H7760]] these worn-out [[H1094]] rags [[H5499]] and clothes [[H4418]] under your arms [[H679]] to pad the ropes.” [[H2256]] Jeremiah [[H3414]] did [[H6213]] so, [[H3651]]

###### 13
and they pulled him [[H3414]] up [[H4900]] with the ropes [[H2256]] and lifted [[H5927]] him [[H853]] out of [[H4480]] the cistern. [[H953]] And Jeremiah [[H3414]] remained [[H3427]] in the courtyard [[H2691]] of the guard. [[H4307]]

###### 14
Then King [[H4428]] Zedekiah [[H6667]] sent for [[H7971]] Jeremiah [[H3414]] the prophet [[H5030]] and received [[H3947]] him [[H853]] at [[H413]] the third [[H7992]] entrance [[H3996]] that is in the house [[H1004]] of the LORD. [[H3068]] “I [[H589]] am going to ask [[H7592]] you something,” [[H1697]] said [[H559]] the king [[H4428]] to [[H413]] Jeremiah. [[H3414]] “Do not [[H408]] hide [[H3582]] anything [[H1697]] from me.” [[H4480]]

###### 15
“If [[H3588]] I tell you,” [[H5046]] Jeremiah [[H3414]] replied, [[H559]] “will you not [[H3808]] surely [[H4191]] put me to death? [[H4191]] And even if [[H3588]] I did give you advice, [[H3289]] you would not [[H3808]] listen [[H8085]] to me.” [[H413]]

###### 16
But King [[H4428]] Zedekiah [[H6667]] swore [[H7650]] to [[H413]] Jeremiah [[H3414]] secretly, [[H5643]] “As surely as the LORD [[H3068]] lives, [[H2416]] who [[H834]] has given [[H6213]] us this [[H2063]] life, [[H5315]] I will not [[H518]] kill you [[H4191]] or hand you over to [[H5414]] these [[H428]] men [[H376]] who [[H834]] are seeking [[H1245]] your life. [[H5315]]

###### 17
Then Jeremiah [[H3414]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Zedekiah, [[H6667]] “This is what [[H3541]] the LORD, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of Hosts, [[H6635]] the God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] says: [[H559]] ‘If [[H518]] you indeed surrender [[H3318]] to [[H413]] the officers [[H8269]] of the king [[H4428]] of Babylon, [[H894]] then you [[H5315]] will live, [[H2421]] this [[H2063]] city [[H5892]] will not [[H3808]] be burned down, [[H8313]] and you [[H859]] and your household [[H1004]] will survive. [[H2421]]

###### 18
But if [[H518]] you do not [[H3808]] surrender [[H3318]] to [[H413]] the officers [[H8269]] of the king [[H4428]] of Babylon, [[H894]] then this [[H2063]] city [[H5892]] will be handed over to [[H5414]] the Chaldeans. [[H3778]] They will burn it down, [[H8313]] and you [[H859]] yourself will not [[H3808]] escape [[H4422]] their grasp.’” [[H3027]]

###### 19
But King [[H4428]] Zedekiah [[H6667]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Jeremiah, [[H3414]] “I [[H589]] am afraid [[H1672]] of the Jews [[H3064]] who [[H834]] have deserted [[H5307]] to [[H413]] the Chaldeans, [[H3778]] for [the Chaldeans] [[H6435]] may hand me over to [[H5414]] them [[H3027]] to abuse me.” [[H5953]]

###### 20
“They will not [[H3808]] hand you over,” [[H5414]] Jeremiah [[H3414]] replied. [[H559]] “Obey [[H8085]] the voice [[H6963]] of the LORD [[H3068]] in what [[H834]] I [[H589]] am telling you, [[H1696]] so it may go well [[H3190]] with you  and you [[H5315]] may live. [[H2421]]

###### 21
But if [[H518]] you [[H859]] refuse [[H3986]] to surrender, [[H3318]] this [[H2088]] [is] the word [[H1697]] that [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] has shown me: [[H7200]]

###### 22
All [[H3605]] the women [[H802]] who [[H834]] remain [[H7604]] in the palace [[H1004]] of the king [[H4428]] of Judah [[H3063]] will be brought out [[H3318]] to [[H413]] the officials [[H8269]] of the king [[H4428]] of Babylon, [[H894]] and those [women] [[H2007]] will say: [[H559]] ‘They misled you [[H5496]] and overcame you— [[H3201]] those trusted [[H7965]] friends of yours. [[H376]] Your feet [[H7272]] sank [[H2883]] into the mire, [[H1206]] and they deserted [[H5472]] you. [[H268]]

###### 23
All [[H3605]] your wives [[H802]] and [[H853]] children [[H1121]] will be brought out [[H3318]] to [[H413]] the Chaldeans. [[H3778]] And you [[H859]] yourself will not [[H3808]] escape [[H4422]] their grasp, [[H3027]] for [[H3588]] you will be seized [[H8610]] by [[H3027]] the king [[H4428]] of Babylon, [[H894]] and this [[H2063]] city [[H5892]] will be burned down.’ [[H8313]]

###### 24
Then Zedekiah [[H6667]] warned [[H559]] Jeremiah, [[H3414]] “Do not [[H408]] let anyone [[H376]] know [[H3045]] about this [[H428]] conversation, [[H1697]] or [[H3808]] you will die. [[H4191]]

###### 25
If [[H3588]] the officials [[H8269]] hear [[H8085]] that [[H3588]] I have spoken [[H1696]] with [[H854]] you and come [[H935]] and demand [[H559]] of you, [[H413]] ‘Tell [[H5046]] us what [[H4100]] you said [[H1696]] to [[H413]] the king [[H4428]] and what [[H4100]] [he] [[H4428]] said [[H1696]] to you; [[H413]] do not [[H408]] hide it [[H3582]] from us, [[H4480]] [or] [[H3808]] we will kill you, [[H4191]]

###### 26
then tell them, [[H559]] ‘I [[H589]] was presenting [[H5307]] to [[H6440]] the king [[H4428]] my petition [[H8467]] that he not [[H1115]] return [[H7725]] me to the house [[H1004]] of Jonathan [[H3083]] to die [[H4191]] there.’” [[H8033]]

###### 27
When all [[H3605]] the officials [[H8269]] came [[H935]] to [[H413]] Jeremiah [[H3414]] and questioned him, [[H7592]] he reported [[H5046]] to them [[H1992]] the exact [[H3605]] words [[H1697]] the king [[H4428]] had commanded. [[H6680]] So they said no more [[H2790]] to him, [[H4480]] for [[H3588]] no one [[H3808]] had overheard [[H8085]] the conversation. [[H1697]]

###### 28
And Jeremiah [[H3414]] remained [[H3427]] in the courtyard [[H2691]] of the guard [[H4307]] until [[H5704]] the day [[H3117]] Jerusalem [[H3389]] was captured. [[H3920]]
