###### 1
“If [[H518]] you will return, [[H7725]] O Israel, [[H3478]] return [[H7725]] to Me,” [[H413]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD. [[H3068]] “If [[H518]] you will remove [[H5493]] your detestable idols [[H8251]] from My sight [[H6440]] and no longer [[H3808]] waver, [[H5110]]

###### 2
and if you can swear, [[H7650]] ‘As surely as the LORD [[H3068]] lives,’ [[H2416]] in truth, [[H571]] in justice, [[H4941]] and in righteousness, [[H6666]] then the nations [[H1471]] will be blessed by Him, [[H1288]] and in Him  they will glory.” [[H1984]]

###### 3
For [[H3588]] this is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] says [[H559]] to the men [[H376]] of Judah [[H3063]] and Jerusalem: [[H3389]] “Break up [[H5214]] your unplowed ground, [[H5215]] and do not [[H408]] sow [[H2232]] among [[H413]] the thorns. [[H6975]]

###### 4
Circumcise yourselves [[H4135]] to the LORD, [[H3068]] remove [[H5493]] the foreskins [[H6190]] of your hearts, [[H3824]] O men [[H376]] of Judah [[H3063]] and people [[H3427]] of Jerusalem. [[H3389]] Otherwise, [[H6435]] My wrath [[H2534]] will break out [[H3318]] like fire [[H784]] and burn [[H1197]] with no [[H369]] one to extinguish it, [[H3518]] because of [[H6440]] your evil [[H7455]] deeds.” [[H4611]]

###### 5
Announce [[H5046]] in Judah, [[H3063]] proclaim [[H8085]] in Jerusalem, [[H3389]] and say: [[H559]] “Blow [[H8628]] the trumpet [[H7782]] in the land. [[H776]] Cry aloud [[H7121]] and say, [[H559]] ‘Assemble yourselves [[H622]] and let us flee [[H935]] to [[H413]] the fortified [[H4013]] cities.’ [[H5892]]

###### 6
Raise [[H5375]] a signal flag [[H5251]] toward Zion. [[H6726]] Seek refuge! [[H5756]] Do not [[H408]] delay! [[H5975]] For [[H3588]] I [[H595]] am bringing [[H935]] disaster [[H7451]] from the north, [[H6828]] and terrible [[H1419]] destruction. [[H7667]]

###### 7
A lion [[H738]] has gone up [[H5927]] from his thicket, [[H5441]] and a destroyer [[H7843]] of nations [[H1471]] has set out. [[H5265]] He has left [[H3318]] his lair [[H4725]] to lay [[H7760]] waste [[H8047]] to your land. [[H776]] Your cities [[H5892]] will be reduced [[H369]] to ruins [[H5327]] and lie uninhabited. [[H3427]]

###### 8
So [[H5921]] put on [[H2296]] sackcloth, [[H8242]] mourn [[H5594]] and wail, [[H3213]] for [[H3588]] the fierce [[H2740]] anger [[H639]] of the LORD [[H3068]] has not [[H3808]] turned away [[H7725]] from us.” [[H4480]]

###### 9
“In that [[H1931]] day,” [[H3117]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD, [[H3068]] “the king [[H4428]] and officials [[H8269]] will lose [[H6]] their courage. [[H3820]] The priests [[H3548]] will tremble in fear, [[H8074]] and the prophets [[H5030]] will be astounded.” [[H8539]]

###### 10
Then I said, [[H559]] “Ah, [[H162]] Lord [[H136]] GOD, [[H3069]] how completely [[H403]] You have deceived [[H5377]] this [[H2088]] people [[H5971]] and Jerusalem [[H3389]] by saying, [[H559]] ‘You will have [[H1961]] peace,’ [[H7965]] when a sword [[H2719]] is at [[H5704]] our throats.” [[H5315]]

###### 11
At that [[H1931]] time [[H6256]] it will be said [[H559]] to this [[H2088]] people [[H5971]] and to Jerusalem, [[H3389]] “A searing [[H6703]] wind [[H7307]] from the barren heights [[H8205]] in the desert [[H4057]] blows toward [[H1870]] the daughter [[H1323]] of My people, [[H5971]] but not [[H3808]] to winnow [[H2219]] or to sift; [[H1305]]

###### 12
a wind [[H7307]] too strong [[H4392]] for that [[H428]] comes [[H935]] from Me.  Now [[H6258]] I [[H589]] will also [[H1571]] pronounce [[H1696]] judgments [[H4941]] against them.” [[H854]]

###### 13
Behold, [[H2009]] he advances [[H5927]] like the clouds, [[H6051]] his chariots [[H4818]] like the whirlwind. [[H5492]] His horses [[H5483]] are swifter [[H7043]] than eagles. [[H5404]] Woe to us, [[H188]] for [[H3588]] we are ruined! [[H7703]]

###### 14
Wash [[H3526]] the evil [[H7451]] from your heart, [[H3820]] O Jerusalem, [[H3389]] so that [[H4616]] you may be saved. [[H3467]] How long [[H5704]] will you harbor [[H3885]] wicked [[H205]] thoughts [[H4284]] within you? [[H7130]]

###### 15
For [[H3588]] a voice [[H6963]] resounds [[H5046]] from Dan, [[H1835]] proclaiming [[H8085]] disaster [[H205]] from Mount [[H2022]] Ephraim. [[H669]]

###### 16
Warn [[H2142]] the nations [[H1471]] now! [[H2009]] Proclaim [[H8085]] to [[H5921]] Jerusalem: [[H3389]] “A besieging army [[H5341]] comes [[H935]] from a distant [[H4801]] land; [[H776]] they raise [[H5414]] their voices [[H6963]] against [[H5921]] the cities [[H5892]] of Judah. [[H3063]]

###### 17
They surround her [[H5439]] like men guarding [[H8104]] a field, [[H7704]] because [[H3588]] she has rebelled against Me, [[H4784]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD. [[H3069]]

###### 18
Your ways [[H1870]] and your deeds [[H4611]] have brought [[H6213]] this upon you. [[H428]] This [[H2063]] is your punishment. [[H7451]] How bitter it is, [[H4751]] because [[H3588]] it pierces [[H5060]] to the [[H5704]] heart!” [[H3820]]

###### 19
My anguish, [[H4578]] my anguish! [[H4578]] I writhe in pain! [[H2342]] Oh, the pain [[H7023]] in my chest! [[H3820]] My heart [[H3820]] pounds [[H1993]] within me;  I cannot [[H3808]] be silent. [[H2790]] For [[H3588]] I [[H5315]] have heard [[H8085]] the sound [[H6963]] of the trumpet, [[H7782]] the alarm [[H8643]] of battle. [[H4421]]

###### 20
Disaster [[H7667]] after [[H5921]] disaster [[H7667]] is proclaimed, [[H7121]] for [[H3588]] the whole [[H3605]] land [[H776]] is laid waste. [[H7703]] My tents [[H168]] are destroyed [[H7703]] in an instant, [[H6597]] my curtains [[H3407]] in a moment. [[H7281]]

###### 21
How long [[H5704]] must I see [[H7200]] the signal flag [[H5251]] and hear [[H8085]] the sound [[H6963]] of the trumpet? [[H7782]]

###### 22
“For [[H3588]] My people [[H5971]] are fools; [[H191]] they have not [[H3808]] known Me. [[H3045]] They [[H1992]] are foolish [[H5530]] children, [[H1121]] without [[H3808]] understanding. [[H995]] They [[H1992]] are skilled [[H2450]] in doing evil, [[H7489]] but they do not [[H3808]] know [[H3045]] how to do good.” [[H3190]]

###### 23
I looked [[H7200]] at the earth, [[H776]] and it was formless [[H8414]] and empty; [[H922]] [I looked] to [[H413]] the heavens, [[H8064]] and they [had] no [[H369]] light. [[H216]]

###### 24
I looked [[H7200]] at the mountains, [[H2022]] and behold, [[H2009]] they were quaking; [[H7493]] all [[H3605]] the hills [[H1389]] were swaying. [[H7043]]

###### 25
I looked, [[H7200]] and no [[H369]] man was left; [[H120]] all [[H3605]] the birds [[H5775]] of the sky [[H8064]] had fled. [[H5074]]

###### 26
I looked, [[H7200]] and the fertile field [[H3759]] was a desert. [[H4057]] All [[H3605]] its cities [[H5892]] were torn down [[H5422]] before [[H6440]] the LORD, [[H3068]] before [[H6440]] His fierce [[H2740]] anger. [[H639]]

###### 27
For [[H3588]] this is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] says: [[H559]] “The whole [[H3605]] land [[H776]] will be [[H1961]] desolate, [[H8077]] but I will not [[H3808]] finish its destruction. [[H3617]]

###### 28
Therefore [[H5921]] the earth [[H776]] will mourn [[H56]] [and] the heavens [[H8064]] above [[H4605]] grow dark. [[H6937]] I have spoken, [[H1696]] I have planned, [[H2161]] and I will not [[H3808]] relent [[H5162]] or turn back. [[H7725]]

###### 29
Every [[H3605]] city [[H5892]] flees [[H1272]] at the sound [[H6963]] of the horseman [[H6571]] and archer. [[H7411]] They enter [[H935]] the thickets [[H5645]] and climb [[H5927]] among the rocks. [[H3710]] Every [[H3605]] city [[H5892]] is abandoned; [[H5800]] no [[H369]] inhabitant is left. [[H3427]]

###### 30
And you, [[H859]] O devastated [[H7703]] one, [[H4100]] what will you do, [[H6213]] though [[H3588]] you dress [[H3847]] yourself in scarlet, [[H8144]] though [[H3588]] you adorn [[H5710]] yourself with gold [[H2091]] jewelry, [[H5716]] though [[H3588]] you enlarge [[H7167]] your eyes [[H5869]] with paint? [[H6320]] You adorn yourself [[H3302]] in vain; [[H7723]] your lovers [[H5689]] despise you; [[H3988]] they want to take [[H1245]] your life. [[H5315]]

###### 31
I hear [[H8085]] a cry [[H6963]] like a woman in labor, [[H2470]] a cry of anguish [[H6869]] like one bearing her first child— [[H1069]] the cry [[H6963]] of the Daughter [[H1323]] of Zion [[H6726]] gasping for breath, [[H3306]] stretching out [[H6566]] her hands: [[H3709]] ‘Woe is me, [[H188]] for [[H3588]] my soul [[H5315]] faints [[H5888]] before the murderers!’” [[H2026]]
