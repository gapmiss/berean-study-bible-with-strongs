### 1
[This is] the word [[H1697]] that [[H834]] came [[H1961]] to [[H413]] Jeremiah [[H3414]] from the LORD: [[H3068]]

### 2
“Listen [[H8085]] to the words [[H1697]] of this [[H2063]] covenant [[H1285]] and tell [[H1696]] them to [[H413]] the men [[H376]] of Judah [[H3063]] and the residents [[H3427]] of Jerusalem. [[H3389]]

### 3
You must tell them that [[H559]] this is what [[H3541]] the LORD, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] says: [[H559]] ‘Cursed [is] [[H779]] the man [[H376]] who [[H834]] does not [[H3808]] obey [[H8085]] the words [[H1697]] of this [[H2063]] covenant, [[H1285]]

### 4
which [[H834]] I commanded [[H6680]] your forefathers [[H1]] when [[H3117]] I brought them out [[H3318]] of the land [[H776]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] out of the iron [[H1270]] furnace, [[H3564]] saying, [[H559]] “Obey Me, [[H8085]] and do [[H6213]] everything [[H3605]] that [[H834]] I command you, [[H6680]] and you will be [[H1961]] My people, [[H5971]] and I [[H595]] will be [[H1961]] your God. [[H430]]

### 5
[This was] in order to [[H4616]] establish [[H6965]] the oath [[H7621]] I swore [[H7650]] to your forefathers, [[H1]] to give [[H5414]] them a land [[H776]] flowing [[H2100]] with milk [[H2461]] and honey, [[H1706]] as it is to this day.’” [[H3117]] “Amen, [[H543]] LORD,” [[H3069]] I answered. [[H6030]]

### 6
Then the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H559]] to me, [[H413]] “Proclaim [[H7121]] all [[H3605]] these [[H428]] words [[H1697]] in the cities [[H5892]] of Judah [[H3063]] and in the streets [[H2351]] of Jerusalem, [[H3389]] saying, [[H559]] ‘Hear [[H8085]] the words [[H1697]] of this [[H2063]] covenant [[H1285]] and carry them out. [[H6213]]

### 7
For [[H3588]] from the time [[H3117]] I brought [[H5927]] your fathers [[H1]] out of the land [[H776]] of Egypt [[H4714]] until today, [[H5704]] I strongly warned [[H5749]] them time and time again, [[H7925]] saying, [[H559]] “Obey [[H8085]] My voice.” [[H6963]]

### 8
Yet they would [[H3808]] not [[H3808]] obey [[H8085]] or incline [[H5186]] their ears, [[H241]] but each one [[H376]] followed [[H1980]] the stubbornness [[H8307]] of his evil [[H7451]] heart. [[H3820]] So I brought [[H935]] on [[H5921]] them all [[H3605]] the curses [[H1697]] of this [[H2063]] covenant [[H1285]] I commanded [[H6680]] them to follow [[H6213]] but they did not keep.’” [[H6213]]

### 9
And the LORD [[H3068]] told [[H559]] me, [[H413]] “There is [[H4672]] a conspiracy [[H7195]] among the men [[H376]] of Judah [[H3063]] and the residents [[H3427]] of Jerusalem. [[H3389]]

### 10
They have returned [[H7725]] to [[H5921]] the sins [[H5771]] of their forefathers [[H1]] who [[H834]] refused [[H3985]] to obey [[H8085]] My words. [[H1697]] They [[H1992]] have followed [[H1980]] other [[H312]] gods [[H430]] to serve them. [[H5647]] The house [[H1004]] of Israel [[H3478]] and the house [[H1004]] of Judah [[H3063]] have broken [[H6565]] the covenant [[H1285]] I made [[H3772]] with [[H854]] their fathers. [[H1]]

### 11
Therefore [[H3651]] this is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] says: [[H559]] I am about to bring [[H935]] upon them [[H413]] a disaster [[H7451]] that [[H834]] they cannot [[H3808]] escape. [[H3318]] They will cry out [[H2199]] to Me, [[H413]] but I will not [[H3808]] listen [[H8085]] to them. [[H413]]

### 12
Then the cities [[H5892]] of Judah [[H3063]] and the residents [[H3427]] of Jerusalem [[H3389]] will go [[H1980]] and cry out [[H2199]] to [[H413]] the gods [[H430]] to which [[H834]] they [[H1992]] have been burning incense, [[H6999]] but [these gods] certainly will not [[H3808]] save them [[H3467]] in their time [[H6256]] of disaster. [[H7451]]

### 13
Your gods [[H430]] are [[H1961]] indeed [[H3588]] as numerous [[H4557]] as your cities, [[H5892]] O Judah, [[H3063]] and the altars [[H4196]] you have set up [[H7760]] to shame— [[H1322]] the altars [[H4196]] to burn incense [[H6999]] to Baal— [[H1168]] are as many [[H4557]] as the streets [[H2351]] of Jerusalem. [[H3389]]

### 14
As for you, [[H859]] do not [[H408]] pray [[H6419]] for [[H1157]] these [[H2088]] people. [[H5971]] Do not [[H408]] raise up [[H5375]] a cry [[H7440]] or a prayer [[H8605]] on their behalf, [[H1157]] for [[H3588]] I will not [[H369]] be listening [[H8085]] when they call out [[H7121]] to [[H413]] Me at the time [[H6256]] of their disaster. [[H7451]]

### 15
What right [[H4100]] has My beloved [[H3039]] in My house, [[H1004]] having carried out [[H6213]] so many [[H7227]] evil schemes? [[H4209]] Can consecrated [[H6944]] meat [[H1320]] avert [[H5674]] your doom, [[H7451]] so that [[H227]] you can rejoice? [[H5937]]

### 16
The LORD [[H3068]] once called [[H7121]] you [[H8034]] a flourishing [[H7488]] olive tree, [[H2132]] beautiful [[H3303]] with well-formed [[H8389]] fruit. [[H6529]] But with a mighty [[H1419]] roar [[H6963]] He will set fire [[H3341]] to it, [[H5921]] and its branches [[H1808]] will be consumed. [[H7489]]

### 17
The LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts [[H6635]] who planted [[H5193]] you [[H853]] has decreed [[H1696]] disaster [[H7451]] upon you, [[H5921]] because of [[H1558]] the evil that [[H7451]] the house [[H1004]] of Israel [[H3478]] and the house [[H1004]] of Judah [[H3063]] have brought upon themselves, [[H6213]] provoking Me to anger [[H3707]] by burning incense [[H6999]] to Baal.” [[H1168]]

### 18
And the LORD [[H3068]] informed me, [[H3045]] so I knew. [[H3045]] Then [[H227]] You showed me [[H7200]] their deeds. [[H4611]]

### 19
For I [[H589]] was like a gentle [[H441]] lamb [[H3532]] led [[H2986]] to slaughter; [[H2873]] I did not [[H3808]] know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] they had plotted [[H2803]] against me: [[H5921]] “Let us destroy [[H7843]] the tree [[H6086]] with its fruit; [[H3899]] let us cut him off [[H3772]] from the land [[H776]] of the living, [[H2416]] that his name [[H8034]] will be remembered [[H2142]] no [[H3808]] more. [[H5750]]

### 20
But, O LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts, [[H6635]] who judges [[H8199]] righteously, [[H6664]] who tests [[H974]] the heart [[H3629]] and mind, [[H3820]] let me see [[H7200]] Your vengeance [[H5360]] upon them, [[H1992]] for [[H3588]] I have committed [[H1540]] my cause [[H7379]] to You. [[H413]]

### 21
Therefore, [[H3651]] this is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] says [[H559]] concerning [[H5921]] the people [[H376]] of Anathoth [[H6068]] who are seeking [[H1245]] your life [[H5315]] and saying, [[H559]] “You must not [[H3808]] prophesy [[H5012]] in the name [[H8034]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] or you will die [[H4191]] by our hand.” [[H3027]]

### 22
So [[H3651]] this is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts [[H6635]] says: [[H559]] “I will punish them. [[H6485]] Their young men [[H970]] will die [[H4191]] by the sword, [[H2719]] their sons [[H1121]] and daughters [[H1323]] by famine. [[H7458]]

### 23
There will be [[H1961]] no [[H3808]] remnant, [[H7611]] for [[H3588]] I will bring [[H935]] disaster [[H7451]] on [[H413]] the people [[H376]] of Anathoth [[H6068]] in the year [[H8141]] of their punishment.” [[H6486]]
