###### 1
“At that [[H1931]] time,” [[H6256]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD, [[H3068]] “the bones [[H6106]] of the kings [[H4428]] of Judah, [[H3063]] the bones [[H6106]] of the officials, [[H8269]] the bones [[H6106]] of the priests, [[H3548]] the bones [[H6106]] of the prophets, [[H5030]] and the bones [[H6106]] of the people [[H3427]] of Jerusalem [[H3389]] will be removed [[H3318]] from their graves. [[H6913]]

###### 2
They will be exposed [[H7849]] to the sun [[H8121]] and moon, [[H3394]] and all [[H3605]] the host [[H6635]] of heaven [[H8064]] which [[H834]] they have loved, [[H157]] served, [[H5647]] followed, [[H1980]] consulted, [[H1875]] and worshiped. [[H7812]] Their bones will not [[H3808]] be gathered up [[H622]] [or] [[H3808]] buried, [[H6912]] but will become [[H1961]] like dung [[H1828]] lying on [[H5921]] the ground. [[H127]]

###### 3
And wherever [[H3605]] I have banished them, [[H5080]] the remnant [[H7611]] of this [[H2063]] evil [[H7451]] family [[H4940]] will choose [[H977]] death [[H4194]] over [[H4480]] life, [[H2416]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts. [[H6635]]

###### 4
So you are to tell [[H559]] them [[H413]] this is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] says: [[H559]] ‘Do [men] fall [[H5307]] and not [[H3808]] get up again? [[H6965]] Does one turn away [[H7725]] and not [[H3808]] return? [[H7725]]

###### 5
Why [then] [[H4069]] have these [[H2088]] people [[H5971]] turned away? [[H7725]] Why does Jerusalem [[H3389]] always turn away? [[H4878]] They cling [[H2388]] to deceit; [[H8649]] they refuse [[H3985]] to return. [[H7725]]

###### 6
I have listened [[H7181]] and heard; [[H8085]] they do not [[H3808]] speak [[H1696]] what is right. [[H3651]] No [[H369]] one [[H376]] repents [[H5162]] of his [[H5921]] wickedness, [[H7451]] asking, [[H559]] “What [[H4100]] have I done?” [[H6213]] Everyone [[H3605]] has stayed [[H7725]] his course [[H4794]] like a horse [[H5483]] charging [[H7857]] into battle. [[H4421]]

###### 7
Even [[H1571]] the stork [[H2624]] in the sky [[H8064]] knows [[H3045]] her appointed seasons. [[H4150]] The turtledove, [[H8449]] the swift, [[H5483]] and the thrush [[H5693]] observe [[H8104]] their time [[H6256]] of migration, [[H935]] but My people [[H5971]] do not [[H3808]] know [[H3045]] the requirements [[H4941]] of the LORD. [[H3068]]

###### 8
How [[H349]] can you say, [[H559]] ‘We [[H587]] are wise, [[H2450]] and the law [[H8451]] of the LORD [[H3068]] is with us?’ [[H854]] But in fact, [[H403]] the lying [[H8267]] pen [[H5842]] of the scribes [[H5608]] has produced [[H6213]] a deception. [[H8267]]

###### 9
The wise [[H2450]] will be put to shame; [[H954]] they will be dismayed [[H2865]] and snared. [[H3920]] They have rejected [[H3988]] the word [[H1697]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] so what [[H4100]] wisdom [[H2451]] do they really have? 

###### 10
Therefore [[H3651]] I will give [[H5414]] their wives [[H802]] to other men [[H312]] [and] their fields [[H7704]] to new owners, [[H3423]] for [[H3588]] from the least [[H6996]] to [[H5704]] the greatest, [[H1419]] all [[H3605]] are greedy [[H1214]] for gain; [[H1215]] from the prophet [[H5030]] to [[H5704]] the priest, [[H3548]] all [[H3605]] practice [[H6213]] deceit. [[H8267]]

###### 11
They dress [[H7495]] the wounds [[H7667]] of the daughter [[H1323]] of My people [[H5971]] with very little care, [[H7043]] saying, [[H559]] ‘Peace, [[H7965]] peace,’ [[H7965]] when there is no [[H369]] peace. [[H7965]]

###### 12
Are they ashamed [[H3001]] of their loathsome [[H8441]] conduct? [[H6213]] No, [[H1571]] they have no shame [[H3808]] at all, [[H954]] not even [enough] [[H3808]] to blush. [[H3637]] Therefore [[H3651]] they will fall [[H5307]] among the fallen. [[H5307]] When [[H6256]] I punish them, [[H6486]] they will collapse, [[H3782]] says [[H559]] the LORD. [[H3068]]

###### 13
I will take away their harvest, [[H622]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD. [[H3069]] There will be no [[H369]] grapes [[H6025]] on the vine, [[H1612]] nor [[H369]] figs [[H8384]] on the tree, [[H8384]] and even the leaf [[H5929]] will wither. [[H5034]] Whatever I have given [[H5414]] them [[H1992]] will be lost to them.” [[H5674]]

###### 14
“Why [[H5921]] are we [[H587]] just sitting here? [[H3427]] Gather together, [[H622]] let us flee [[H935]] to [[H413]] the fortified [[H4013]] cities [[H5892]] and perish [[H1826]] there, [[H8033]] for [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] our God [[H430]] has doomed us. [[H1826]] He has given us poisoned [[H7219]] water [[H4325]] to drink, [[H8248]] because [[H3588]] we have sinned [[H2398]] against the LORD. [[H3068]]

###### 15
We hoped [[H6960]] for peace, [[H7965]] but no [[H369]] good [has come], [[H2896]] for a time [[H6256]] of healing, [[H4832]] but there [[H2009]] was only terror. [[H1205]]

###### 16
The snorting [[H5170]] of [enemy] horses [[H5483]] is heard [[H8085]] from Dan. [[H1835]] At the sound [[H6963]] of the neighing [[H4684]] of mighty steeds, [[H47]] the whole [[H3605]] land [[H776]] quakes. [[H7493]] They come [[H935]] to devour [[H398]] the land [[H776]] and everything in it, [[H4393]] the city [[H5892]] and all who dwell [[H3427]] in it.” 

###### 17
“For [[H3588]] behold, [[H2005]] I will send [[H7971]] snakes among you, [[H5175]] poisonous vipers [[H6848]] that [[H834]] cannot [[H369]] be charmed, [[H3908]] and they will bite [[H5391]] you,” [[H853]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD. [[H3068]]

###### 18
My sorrow [[H3015]] is beyond [[H5921]] healing; [[H4010]] my heart [[H3820]] [is] faint [[H1742]] within me. [[H5921]]

###### 19
Listen [[H6963]] to the cry [[H7775]] of the daughter [[H1323]] of my people [[H5971]] from a land far away, [[H4801]] “Is the LORD [[H3068]] no [[H369]] longer in Zion? [[H6726]] Is her [[H518]] King [[H4428]] no longer there?” [[H369]] “Why [[H4069]] have they provoked Me to anger [[H3707]] with their carved images, [[H6456]] with their worthless foreign [[H5236]] idols?” [[H1892]]

###### 20
“The harvest [[H7105]] has passed, [[H5674]] the summer [[H7019]] has ended, [[H3615]] but we [[H587]] have not [[H3808]] been saved.” [[H3467]]

###### 21
For [[H5921]] the brokenness [[H7667]] of the daughter [[H1323]] of my people [[H5971]] I am crushed. [[H7665]] I mourn; [[H6937]] horror [[H8047]] has gripped me. [[H2388]]

###### 22
Is there no [[H369]] balm [[H6875]] in Gilead? [[H1568]] Is no [[H369]] physician [[H7495]] there? [[H8033]] Why [[H4069]] then [[H3588]] has the health [[H724]] of the daughter [[H1323]] of my people [[H5971]] not [[H3808]] been restored? [[H5927]]
