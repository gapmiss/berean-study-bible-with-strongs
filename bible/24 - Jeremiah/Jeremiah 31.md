###### 1
“At that [[H1931]] time,” [[H6256]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD, [[H3068]] “I will be [[H1961]] the God [[H430]] of all [[H3605]] the families [[H4940]] of Israel, [[H3478]] and they [[H1992]] will be [[H1961]] My people.” [[H5971]]

###### 2
This is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] says: [[H559]] “The people [[H5971]] who survived [[H8300]] the sword [[H2719]] found [[H4672]] favor [[H2580]] in the wilderness [[H4057]] when Israel [[H3478]] went [[H1980]] to find rest.” [[H7280]]

###### 3
The LORD [[H3068]] appeared [[H7200]] to him  from afar: [[H7350]] “I have loved [[H157]] you with an everlasting [[H5769]] love; [[H160]] therefore [[H5921]] I have drawn you [[H4900]] with loving devotion. [[H2617]]

###### 4
Again [[H5750]] I will build you, [[H1129]] and you will be rebuilt, [[H1129]] O Virgin [[H1330]] Israel. [[H3478]] Again [[H5750]] you will take up [[H5710]] your tambourines [[H8596]] and go out [[H3318]] in joyful [[H7832]] dancing. [[H4234]]

###### 5
Again [[H5750]] you will plant [[H5193]] vineyards [[H3754]] on the hills [[H2022]] of Samaria; [[H8111]] the farmers [[H5193]] will plant [[H5193]] and enjoy the fruit. [[H2490]]

###### 6
For [[H3588]] there will be [[H3426]] a day [[H3117]] when watchmen [[H5341]] will call out [[H7121]] on the hills [[H2022]] of Ephraim, [[H669]] ‘Arise, [[H6965]] let us go up [[H5927]] to Zion, [[H6726]] to [[H413]] the LORD [[H3068]] our God!’” [[H430]]

###### 7
For [[H3588]] this is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] says: [[H559]] “Sing [[H7442]] with joy [[H8057]] for Jacob; [[H3290]] shout [[H6670]] for the foremost [[H7218]] of the nations! [[H1471]] Make [[H8085]] your praises heard [[H1984]] and say, [[H559]] ‘O LORD, [[H3068]] save [[H3467]] Your people, [[H5971]] the remnant [[H7611]] of Israel!’ [[H3478]]

###### 8
Behold, [[H2005]] I will bring [[H935]] them [[H853]] from the land [[H776]] of the north [[H6828]] and gather them [[H6908]] from the farthest parts [[H3411]] of the earth, [[H776]] including  the blind [[H5787]] and the lame, [[H6455]] expectant mothers [[H2030]] and women in labor. [[H3205]] They will return [[H7725]] as a great [[H1419]] assembly! [[H6951]]

###### 9
They will come [[H935]] with weeping, [[H1065]] and by their supplication [[H8469]] I will lead them; [[H2986]] I will make them walk [[H1980]] beside [[H413]] streams [[H5158]] of waters, [[H4325]] on a level [[H3477]] path [[H1870]] where they will not [[H3808]] stumble. [[H3782]] For [[H3588]] I am [[H1961]] Israel’s [[H3478]] Father, [[H1]] and Ephraim [[H669]] is My firstborn.” [[H1060]]

###### 10
Hear, [[H8085]] O nations, [[H1471]] the word [[H1697]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] and proclaim it [[H5046]] in distant [[H4801]] coastlands, [[H339]] saying: [[H559]] “The One who scattered [[H2219]] Israel [[H3478]] will gather them [[H6908]] and keep them [[H8104]] as a shepherd [[H7462]] guards his flock. [[H5739]]

###### 11
For [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] has ransomed [[H6299]] Jacob [[H3290]] and redeemed [[H1350]] him from [[H4480]] the hand [[H3027]] that had overpowered him. [[H2389]]

###### 12
They will come [[H935]] and shout for joy [[H7442]] on the heights [[H4791]] of Zion; [[H6726]] they will be radiant [[H5102]] in [[H413]] the bounty [[H2898]] of the LORD— [[H3068]] the grain, [[H1715]] the new wine, [[H8492]] the fresh oil, [[H3323]] and [[H5921]] the young [[H1121]] of the flocks [[H6629]] and herds. [[H1241]] Their life [[H5315]] will be [[H1961]] like a well-watered [[H7302]] garden, [[H1588]] and never [[H3808]] again [[H3254]] will they languish. [[H1669]]

###### 13
Then [[H227]] the maidens [[H1330]] will rejoice [[H8055]] with dancing, [[H4234]] young men [[H970]] and old [[H2205]] as well. [[H3162]] I will turn [[H2015]] their mourning [[H60]] into joy, [[H8342]] and give them comfort [[H5162]] and joy [[H8055]] for their sorrow. [[H3015]]

###### 14
I will refresh [[H7301]] the priests [[H3548]] with abundance, [[H1880]] and My people [[H5971]] will be filled [[H7646]] with My bounty,” [[H2898]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD. [[H3068]]

###### 15
This is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] says: [[H559]] “A voice [[H6963]] is heard [[H8085]] in Ramah, [[H7414]] mourning [[H5092]] and great [[H8563]] weeping, [[H1065]] Rachel [[H7354]] weeping [[H1058]] for [[H5921]] her children, [[H1121]] [and] refusing [[H3985]] consolation, [[H5162]] because [[H3588]] they are no more.” [[H369]]

###### 16
This is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] says: [[H559]] “Keep [[H4513]] your voice [[H6963]] from weeping [[H1065]] and your eyes [[H5869]] from tears, [[H1832]] for [[H3588]] the reward [[H7939]] for your work [[H6468]] will come, [[H3426]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD. [[H3068]] Then [your children] will return [[H7725]] from the land [[H776]] of the enemy. [[H341]]

###### 17
So there is [[H3426]] hope [[H8615]] for your future, [[H319]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD, [[H3068]] and your children [[H1121]] will return [[H7725]] to their own land. [[H1366]]

###### 18
I have surely [[H8085]] heard [[H8085]] Ephraim’s [[H669]] moaning: [[H5110]] ‘You disciplined me severely, [[H3256]] like an untrained [[H3808]] calf. [[H5695]] Restore me, [[H7725]] and I will return, [[H7725]] for [[H3588]] You [are] [[H859]] the LORD [[H3068]] my God. [[H430]]

###### 19
After [[H310]] I returned, [[H7725]] I repented; [[H5162]] and after [[H310]] I was instructed, [[H3045]] I struck [my thigh] [[H5606]] in grief. [[H3409]] I was ashamed [[H954]] and [[H1571]] humiliated [[H3637]] because [[H3588]] I bore [[H5375]] the disgrace [[H2781]] of my youth.’ [[H5271]]

###### 20
Is not Ephraim [[H669]] a precious [[H3357]] son to Me, [[H1121]] a delightful [[H8191]] child? [[H3206]] Though I often [[H1767]] speak against him, [[H1696]] surely I still [[H5750]] remember [[H2142]] him. [[H2142]] Therefore [[H5921]] My heart [[H4578]] yearns for him; [[H1993]] I have great compassion [[H7355]] for him,” [[H7355]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD. [[H3068]]

###### 21
“Set up [[H5324]] the roadmarks, [[H6725]] establish [[H7760]] the signposts. [[H8564]] Keep the highway [[H4546]] in mind, [[H7896]] the road [[H1870]] you have traveled. [[H1980]] Return, [[H7725]] O Virgin [[H1330]] Israel, [[H3478]] return [[H7725]] to [[H413]] these [[H428]] cities of yours. [[H5892]]

###### 22
How long [[H5704]] will you wander, [[H2559]] O faithless [[H7728]] daughter? [[H1323]] For [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] has created [[H1254]] a new thing [[H2319]] in the land— [[H776]] a woman [[H5347]] will surround [[H5437]] a man.” [[H1397]]

###### 23
This is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts, [[H6635]] the God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] says: [[H559]] “When I restore [[H7725]] them [[H853]] from captivity, [[H7622]] they will once again [[H5750]] speak [[H559]] this [[H2088]] word [[H1697]] in the land [[H776]] of Judah [[H3063]] and in its cities: [[H5892]] ‘May the LORD [[H3068]] bless you, [[H1288]] O righteous [[H6664]] dwelling place, [[H5116]] O holy [[H6944]] mountain. [[H2022]]

###### 24
And Judah [[H3063]] and all [[H3605]] its cities [[H5892]] will dwell [[H3427]] together [[H3162]] in [the land],  the farmers [[H406]] and those who move [[H5265]] with the flocks, [[H5739]]

###### 25
for [[H3588]] I will refresh [[H7301]] the weary [[H5889]] soul [[H5315]] and replenish [[H4390]] all [[H3605]] who are weak.” [[H1669]]

###### 26
At [[H5921]] this [[H2063]] I awoke [[H6974]] and looked around. [[H7200]] My sleep [[H8142]] had been most pleasant to me. [[H6149]]

###### 27
“The days [[H3117]] are coming,” [[H935]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD, [[H3068]] “when I will sow [[H2232]] the house [[H1004]] of Israel [[H3478]] and the house [[H1004]] of Judah [[H3063]] with the offspring [[H2233]] of man [[H120]] [and] [[H2233]] of beast. [[H929]]

###### 28
Just as [[H834]] I watched [[H8245]] over [[H5921]] them to uproot [[H5428]] and tear them down, [[H5422]] to demolish, [[H2040]] destroy, [[H6]] and bring disaster, [[H7489]] so [[H3651]] will I be attentive [[H8245]] to build them [[H1129]] and to plant them,” [[H5193]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD. [[H3068]]

###### 29
“In those [[H1992]] days, [[H3117]] it will no [[H3808]] longer [[H5750]] be said: [[H559]] ‘The fathers [[H1]] have eaten [[H398]] sour grapes, [[H1155]] and this has set the children’s [[H1121]] teeth [[H8127]] on edge.’ [[H6949]]

###### 30
Instead, [[H3588]] each [[H376]] will die [[H4191]] for his own iniquity. [[H5771]] If anyone [[H3605]] eats [[H398]] the sour grapes, [[H1155]] his own teeth [[H8127]] will be set on edge. [[H6949]]

###### 31
Behold, [[H2009]] the days [[H3117]] are coming, [[H935]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD, [[H3068]] when I will make [[H3772]] a new [[H2319]] covenant [[H1285]] with [[H854]] the house [[H1004]] of Israel [[H3478]] and with [[H854]] the house [[H1004]] of Judah. [[H3063]]

###### 32
It will not [[H3808]] be like the covenant [[H1285]] I made [[H3772]] with [[H854]] their fathers [[H1]] when [[H3117]] I took [[H2388]] them by the hand [[H3027]] to lead them out [[H3318]] of Egypt— [[H4714]] a covenant [[H1285]] they [[H1992]] broke, [[H6565]] though I [[H595]] was a husband [[H1166]] to them,”  declares [[H5002]] the LORD. [[H3068]]

###### 33
“But [[H3588]] this [[H2063]] is the covenant [[H1285]] I will make [[H3772]] with [[H854]] the house [[H1004]] of Israel [[H3478]] after [[H310]] those [[H1992]] days, [[H3117]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD. [[H3068]] I will put [[H5414]] My law [[H8451]] in their minds [[H7130]] and inscribe it [[H3789]] on [[H5921]] their hearts. [[H3820]] And I will be [[H1961]] their God, [[H430]] and they [[H1992]] will be [[H1961]] My people. [[H5971]]

###### 34
No [[H3808]] longer [[H5750]] will each man [[H376]] teach [[H3925]] his neighbor [[H7453]] [or] [[H376]] his brother, [[H251]] saying, [[H559]] ‘Know [[H3045]] the LORD,’ [[H3068]] because [[H3588]] they will all [[H3605]] know [[H3045]] Me, [[H853]] from the least of them [[H6996]] to [[H5704]] the greatest, [[H1419]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD. [[H3068]] For [[H3588]] I will forgive [[H5545]] their iniquity [[H5771]] and will remember [[H2142]] their sins [[H2403]] no [[H3808]] more. [[H5750]]

###### 35
Thus [[H3541]] says [[H559]] the LORD, [[H3068]] who gives [[H5414]] the sun [[H8121]] for light [[H216]] by day [[H3119]] [and] orders [[H2708]] the moon [[H3394]] and stars [[H3556]] for light [[H216]] by night, [[H3915]] who stirs up [[H7280]] the sea [[H3220]] so that its waves [[H1530]] roar— [[H1993]] the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts [[H6635]] is His name: [[H8034]]

###### 36
“Only if [[H518]] this [[H428]] fixed order [[H2706]] departed [[H4185]] from My presence, [[H6440]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD, [[H3068]] would Israel’s [[H3478]] descendants [[H2233]] ever [[H3605]] cease [[H7673]] to be [[H1961]] a nation [[H1471]] before Me.” [[H6440]]

###### 37
This is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] says: [[H559]] “Only if [[H518]] the heavens [[H8064]] above [[H4605]] could be measured [[H4058]] and the foundations [[H4146]] of the earth [[H776]] below [[H4295]] searched out, [[H2713]] would I [[H589]] reject [[H3988]] all [[H3605]] of Israel’s [[H3478]] descendants [[H2233]] because of [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] they have done,” [[H6213]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD. [[H3068]]

###### 38
“Behold, [[H2009]] the days [[H3117]] are coming,” [[H935]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD, [[H3068]] “when the city [[H5892]] will be rebuilt [[H1129]] for [Me], [[H3068]] from the tower [[H4026]] of Hananel [[H2606]] to the Corner [[H6438]] Gate. [[H8179]]

###### 39
The measuring [[H4060]] line [[H6961]] will once again [[H5750]] stretch out [[H3318]] straight [[H5048]] to [[H5921]] the hill [[H1389]] of Gareb [[H1619]] and then turn [[H5437]] toward Goah. [[H1601]]

###### 40
The whole [[H3605]] valley [[H6010]] of the dead bodies [[H6297]] and of ashes, [[H1880]] and all [[H3605]] the fields [[H8309]] as [[H5704]] far as the Kidron [[H6939]] Valley, [[H5158]] to [[H5704]] the corner [[H6438]] of the Horse [[H5483]] Gate [[H8179]] to the east, [[H4217]] will be holy [[H6944]] to the LORD. [[H3068]] It will never [[H3808]] again [[H5750]] be uprooted [[H5428]] or demolished.” [[H2040]]
