###### 1
Concerning Moab, [[H4124]] this is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts, [[H6635]] the God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] says: [[H559]] “Woe [[H1945]] to [[H413]] Nebo, [[H5015]] for [[H3588]] it will be devastated. [[H7703]] Kiriathaim [[H7156]] will be captured [[H3920]] and disgraced; [[H3001]] the fortress [[H4869]] will be shattered [[H2865]] and dismantled. [[H3001]]

###### 2
There is no [[H369]] longer [[H5750]] praise [[H8416]] for Moab; [[H4124]] in Heshbon [[H2809]] they devise [[H2803]] evil [[H7451]] against her: [[H5921]] ‘Come, [[H1980]] let us cut her off [[H3772]] from nationhood.’ [[H1471]] You too, [[H1571]] O [people of] Madmen, [[H4086]] will be silenced; [[H1826]] the sword [[H2719]] will pursue [[H310]] you. [[H1980]]

###### 3
A voice [[H6963]] cries out [[H6818]] from Horonaim, [[H2773]] ‘Devastation [[H7701]] and great [[H1419]] destruction!’ [[H7667]]

###### 4
Moab [[H4124]] will be shattered; [[H7665]] her little [[H6810]] ones will cry out. [[H2201]]

###### 5
For [[H3588]] on the Ascent [[H4608]] to Luhith [[H3872]] they weep [[H1065]] bitterly [[H1065]] as they go, [[H5927]] and [[H3588]] on the descent [[H4174]] to Horonaim [[H2773]] cries [[H6818]] of distress [[H6862]] resound [[H8085]] over the destruction: [[H7667]]

###### 6
‘Flee! [[H5127]] Run [[H4422]] for your lives! [[H5315]] Become [[H1961]] like a juniper [[H6176]] in the desert.’ [[H4057]]

###### 7
Because [[H3282]] you trust [[H982]] in your works [[H4639]] and treasures, [[H214]] you [[H859]] too [[H1571]] will be captured, [[H3920]] and Chemosh [[H3645]] will go [[H3318]] into exile [[H1473]] with [[H3162]] his priests [[H3548]] and officials. [[H8269]]

###### 8
The destroyer [[H7703]] will move [[H935]] against [[H413]] every [[H3605]] city, [[H5892]] and not [[H3808]] one town [[H5892]] will escape. [[H4422]] The valley [[H6010]] also will be ruined, [[H6]] and the high plain [[H4334]] will be destroyed, [[H8045]] as [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] has said. [[H559]]

###### 9
Put [[H5414]] salt [[H6731]] on Moab, [[H4124]] for [[H3588]] she will be laid waste; [[H5323]] her cities [[H5892]] will become [[H1961]] desolate, [[H8047]] with no one [[H369]] to dwell [[H3427]] in them. [[H2004]]

###### 10
Cursed [be the one] [[H779]] who is negligent [[H7423]] in doing [[H6213]] the work [[H4399]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] and cursed is [[H779]] he who withholds [[H4513]] his sword [[H2719]] from bloodshed. [[H1818]]

###### 11
Moab [[H4124]] has been at ease [[H7599]] from youth, [[H5271]] settled [[H8252]] like wine [[H413]] on its dregs; [[H8105]] he has not [[H3808]] been poured [[H7324]] from vessel [[H3627]] to [[H413]] vessel [[H3627]] or gone [[H1980]] into exile. [[H1473]] So [[H5921]] his taste [[H2940]] has remained the same, [[H5975]] and his aroma [[H7381]] is unchanged. [[H4171]]

###### 12
Therefore [[H3651]] behold, [[H2009]] the days [[H3117]] are coming, [[H935]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD, [[H3068]] when I will send [[H7971]] to him  wanderers, [[H6808]] who will pour him out. [[H6808]] They will empty [[H7324]] his vessels [[H3627]] and shatter [[H5310]] his jars. [[H5035]]

###### 13
Then Moab [[H4124]] will be ashamed [[H954]] of Chemosh, [[H3645]] just as [[H834]] the house [[H1004]] of Israel [[H3478]] was ashamed [[H954]] when they trusted in [[H4009]] Bethel. [[H1008]]

###### 14
How [[H349]] can you say, [[H559]] ‘We [[H587]] are warriors, [[H1368]] mighty men [[H2428]] ready for battle’? [[H4421]]

###### 15
Moab [[H4124]] has been destroyed [[H7703]] and its towns [[H5892]] invaded; [[H5927]] the best [[H4005]] of its young men [[H970]] have gone down [[H3381]] in the slaughter, [[H2875]] declares [[H5002]] the King [[H4428]] whose name [[H8034]] [is] the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts. [[H6635]]

###### 16
Moab’s [[H4124]] calamity [[H343]] is at hand, [[H7138]] and his affliction [[H7451]] is rushing [[H4116]] swiftly. [[H3966]]

###### 17
Mourn for him, [[H5110]] all you [[H3605]] who surround him, [[H5439]] everyone [[H3605]] who knows [[H3045]] his name; [[H8034]] tell [[H559]] how [[H349]] the mighty [[H5797]] scepter [[H4294]] is shattered— [[H7665]] the glorious [[H8597]] staff! [[H4731]]

###### 18
Come down [[H3381]] from your glory; [[H3519]] sit [[H3427]] on parched ground, [[H6772]] O daughter [[H1323]] dwelling [[H3427]] in Dibon, [[H1769]] for [[H3588]] the destroyer [[H7703]] of Moab [[H4124]] has come against you; [[H5927]] he has destroyed [[H7843]] your fortresses. [[H4013]]

###### 19
Stand [[H5975]] by [[H413]] the road [[H1870]] and watch, [[H6822]] O resident [[H3427]] of Aroer! [[H6177]] Ask [[H7592]] the man fleeing [[H5127]] or the woman escaping, [[H4422]] ‘What [[H4100]] has happened?’ [[H1961]]

###### 20
Moab [[H4124]] is put to shame, [[H3001]] for [[H3588]] it has been shattered. [[H2865]] Wail [[H3213]] and cry out! [[H2199]] Declare [[H5046]] by the Arnon [[H769]] that [[H3588]] Moab [[H4124]] is destroyed. [[H7703]]

###### 21
Judgment [[H4941]] has come [[H935]] upon [[H413]] the high plain— [[H4334]] upon [[H413]] Holon, [[H2473]] Jahzah, [[H3096]] and [[H5921]] Mephaath, [[H4158]]

###### 22
upon [[H5921]] Dibon, [[H1769]] Nebo, [[H5015]] and [[H5921]] Beth-diblathaim, [[H1015]]

###### 23
upon [[H5921]] Kiriathaim, [[H7156]] Beth-gamul, [[H1014]] Beth-meon, [[H1010]]

###### 24
upon [[H5921]] Kerioth, [[H7152]] Bozrah, [[H1224]] and all [[H3605]] the towns [[H5892]] of Moab, [[H4124]] those far [[H7350]] and near. [[H7138]]

###### 25
The horn [[H7161]] of Moab [[H4124]] has been cut off; [[H1438]] and his arm [[H2220]] is broken, [[H7665]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD. [[H3068]]

###### 26
Make him drunk, [[H7937]] because [[H3588]] he has magnified [[H1431]] himself against [[H5921]] the LORD; [[H3068]] so Moab [[H4124]] will wallow [[H5606]] in his own vomit, [[H6892]] and he [[H1931]] will also [[H1571]] become [[H1961]] a laughingstock. [[H7814]]

###### 27
Was [[H1961]] not [[H3808]] Israel [[H3478]] your object of ridicule? [[H7814]] Was he ever found [among thieves]? [[H4672]] For [[H3588]] whenever [[H1767]] you speak of him [[H1697]] you shake your head.” [[H5110]]

###### 28
Abandon [[H5800]] the towns [[H5892]] and dwell [[H7931]] among the rocks, [[H5553]] O residents [[H3427]] of Moab! [[H4124]] Be [[H1961]] like a dove [[H3123]] that nests [[H7077]] at [[H5676]] the mouth [[H6310]] of a cave. [[H6354]]

###### 29
We have heard [[H8085]] of Moab’s [[H4124]] pride, [[H1347]] his exceeding [[H3966]] pride [[H1343]] [and] conceit, [[H1363]] his proud arrogance [[H1347]] and haughtiness [[H7312]] of heart. [[H3820]]

###### 30
I [[H589]] know [[H3045]] his fury, [[H5678]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD, [[H3068]] but it is futile. [[H3808]] His boasting [[H907]] is as empty [[H3808]] as [[H3651]] his deeds. [[H6213]]

###### 31
Therefore [[H5921]] I will wail [[H3213]] for [[H5921]] Moab; [[H4124]] I will cry out [[H2199]] for all [[H3605]] of Moab; [[H4124]] I will moan [[H1897]] for [[H413]] the men [[H376]] of Kir-heres. [[H7025]]

###### 32
I will weep for you, [[H1058]] O vine [[H1612]] of Sibmah, [[H7643]] more than I weep [[H1065]] for Jazer. [[H3270]] Your tendrils [[H5189]] have extended [[H5674]] to the sea; [[H3220]] they reach [[H5060]] [even] to [[H5704]] Jazer. [[H3270]] The destroyer [[H7703]] has fallen [[H5307]] on [[H5921]] your summer fruit [[H7019]] and grape harvest. [[H1210]]

###### 33
Joy [[H8057]] and gladness [[H1524]] are removed [[H622]] from the orchard [[H3759]] and from the fields [[H776]] of Moab. [[H4124]] I have stopped [[H7673]] the flow of wine [[H3196]] from the presses; [[H3342]] no one [[H3808]] will tread [[H1869]] with shouts of joy; [[H1959]] their shouts [[H1959]] are not [[H3808]] for joy. [[H1959]]

###### 34
There is a cry [[H2201]] from Heshbon [[H2809]] to [[H5704]] Elealeh; [[H500]] they raise [[H5414]] their voices [[H6963]] to [[H5704]] Jahaz, [[H3096]] from Zoar [[H6820]] to [[H5704]] Horonaim [[H2773]] and Eglath-shelishiyah; [[H5697]] for [[H3588]] even [[H1571]] the waters [[H4325]] of Nimrim [[H5249]] have dried up. [[H4923]]

###### 35
In Moab, [[H4124]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD, [[H3068]] I will bring an end [[H7673]] to those who make offerings [[H5927]] on the high places [[H1116]] and burn incense [[H6999]] to their gods. [[H430]]

###### 36
Therefore [[H5921]] My heart [[H3820]] laments [[H1993]] for Moab [[H4124]] like a flute; [[H2485]] [it] [[H3820]] laments [[H1993]] like a flute [[H2485]] for [[H413]] the men [[H376]] of Kir-heres, [[H7025]] because [[H5921]] the wealth [[H3502]] they acquired [[H6213]] has perished. [[H6]]

###### 37
For [[H3588]] every [[H3605]] head [[H7218]] is shaved [[H7144]] and every [[H3605]] beard [[H2206]] is clipped; [[H1639]] on [[H5921]] every [[H3605]] hand [[H3027]] is a gash [[H1417]] and around [[H5921]] every waist [[H4975]] [is] sackcloth. [[H8242]]

###### 38
On [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] the rooftops [[H1406]] of Moab [[H4124]] and in the public squares, [[H7339]] everyone [[H3605]] is mourning; [[H4553]] for [[H3588]] I have shattered [[H7665]] Moab [[H4124]] like an unwanted [[H2656]] jar, [[H3627]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD. [[H3068]]

###### 39
How [[H349]] shattered [it is]! [[H2865]] How they wail! [[H3213]] How [[H349]] Moab [[H4124]] has turned [[H6437]] his back [[H6203]] in shame! [[H954]] Moab [[H4124]] will become [[H1961]] an object of ridicule [[H7814]] and horror [[H4288]] to all [[H3605]] those around [[H5439]] him.” 

###### 40
For [[H3588]] this is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] says: [[H559]] “Behold, [[H2009]] an eagle [[H5404]] swoops down [[H1675]] and spreads [[H6566]] his wings [[H3671]] against [[H413]] Moab. [[H4124]]

###### 41
Kirioth [[H7152]] has been taken, [[H3920]] and the strongholds [[H4679]] seized. [[H8610]] In that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] the heart [[H3820]] of Moab’s [[H4124]] warriors [[H1368]] will be [[H1961]] like the heart [[H3820]] of a woman [[H802]] in labor. [[H6887]]

###### 42
Moab [[H4124]] will be destroyed [[H8045]] as a nation [[H5971]] because [[H3588]] he vaunted himself [[H1431]] against [[H5921]] the LORD. [[H3068]]

###### 43
Terror, [[H6343]] pit, [[H6354]] and snare [[H6341]] await you, [[H5921]] O resident [[H3427]] of Moab, [[H4124]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD. [[H3068]]

###### 44
He who flees [[H5211]] the panic [[H6343]] will fall [[H5307]] into [[H413]] the pit, [[H6354]] and he who climbs [[H5927]] from [[H4480]] the pit [[H6354]] will be caught [[H3920]] in the snare, [[H6341]] for [[H3588]] I will bring [[H935]] against [[H413]] Moab [[H4124]] the year [[H8141]] of their punishment, [[H6486]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD. [[H3068]]

###### 45
Those who flee [[H5127]] will stand [[H5975]] helpless [[H3581]] in Heshbon’s [[H2809]] shadow, [[H6738]] because [[H3588]] fire [[H784]] has gone forth [[H3318]] from Heshbon [[H2809]] and a flame [[H3852]] from within [[H996]] Sihon. [[H5511]] It will devour [[H398]] the foreheads [[H6285]] of Moab [[H4124]] and the skulls [[H6936]] of the noisemakers. [[H1121]]

###### 46
Woe to you, [[H188]] O Moab! [[H4124]] The people [[H5971]] of Chemosh [[H3645]] have perished; [[H6]] for [[H3588]] your sons [[H1121]] have been taken [[H3947]] into exile [[H7628]] and your daughters [[H1323]] have gone into captivity. [[H7633]]

###### 47
Yet in the latter [[H319]] days [[H3117]] I will restore [[H7725]] Moab [[H4124]] from captivity, [[H7622]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD.” [[H3068]] Here [[H2008]] ends [[H5704]] the judgment [[H4941]] on Moab. [[H4124]]
