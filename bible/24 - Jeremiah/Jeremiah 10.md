### 1
Hear [[H8085]] the word [[H1697]] that [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] speaks [[H1696]] to you, [[H5921]] O house [[H1004]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

### 2
This is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] says: [[H559]] “Do not [[H408]] learn [[H3925]] the ways [[H1870]] of the nations [[H1471]] or be terrified [[H2865]] by the signs [[H226]] in the heavens, [[H8064]] although [[H3588]] the nations [[H1471]] are terrified [[H2865]] by them. [[H1992]]

### 3
For [[H3588]] the customs [[H2708]] of the peoples [[H5971]] are worthless; [[H1892]] they cut down [[H3772]] a tree [[H6086]] from the forest; [[H3293]] it is shaped [[H4639]] with a chisel [[H4621]] by the hands [[H3027]] of a craftsman. [[H2796]]

### 4
They adorn it [[H3302]] with silver [[H3701]] and gold [[H2091]] and fasten it [[H2388]] with hammer [[H4717]] and nails, [[H4548]] so that it will not [[H3808]] totter. [[H6328]]

### 5
Like scarecrows [[H8560]] in a cucumber patch, [[H4749]] their idols [[H1992]] cannot [[H3808]] speak. [[H1696]] They must be carried [[H5375]] because [[H3588]] they cannot [[H3808]] walk. [[H6805]] Do not [[H408]] fear [[H3372]] them, [[H1992]] for [[H3588]] they can do no [[H3808]] harm, [[H7489]] and [[H1571]] neither can they [[H369]] do any good.” [[H3190]]

### 6
There is none [[H369]] like You, [[H3644]] O LORD. [[H3068]] You [[H859]] are great, [[H1419]] and Your name [[H8034]] is mighty [[H1419]] in power. [[H1369]]

### 7
Who [[H4310]] would not [[H3808]] fear You, [[H3372]] O King [[H4428]] of nations? [[H1471]] This is Your due. [[H2969]] For [[H3588]] among all [[H3605]] the wise [men] [[H2450]] of the nations, [[H1471]] and in all [[H3605]] their kingdoms, [[H4438]] there is none [[H369]] like You. [[H3644]]

### 8
But they are altogether [[H259]] senseless [[H1197]] and foolish, [[H3688]] instructed [[H4148]] by worthless idols [[H1892]] made of wood! [[H6086]]

### 9
Hammered [[H7554]] silver [[H3701]] is brought [[H935]] from Tarshish, [[H8659]] and gold [[H2091]] from Uphaz— [[H210]] the work [[H4639]] of a craftsman [[H2796]] from the hands [[H3027]] of a goldsmith. [[H6884]] Their clothing [[H3830]] is blue [[H8504]] and purple, [[H713]] all [[H3605]] fashioned [[H4639]] by skilled workers. [[H2450]]

### 10
But the LORD [[H3068]] is the true [[H571]] God; [[H430]] He [[H1931]] is the living [[H2416]] God [[H430]] and eternal [[H5769]] King. [[H4428]] The earth [[H776]] quakes [[H7493]] at His wrath, [[H7110]] and the nations [[H1471]] cannot [[H3808]] endure [[H3557]] His indignation.” [[H2195]]

### 11
Thus [[H1836]] you are to tell [[H560]] them:  “The gods [[H426]] that [[H1768]] did not [[H3809]] make [[H5648]] heaven [[H8065]] [or] earth [[H778]] will perish [[H7]] from this earth [[H772]] and from [[H4481]] under [[H8460]] these [[H429]] heavens.” [[H8065]]

### 12
[God] made [[H6213]] the earth [[H776]] by His power; [[H3581]] He established [[H3559]] the world [[H8398]] by His wisdom [[H2451]] and stretched out [[H5186]] the heavens [[H8064]] by His understanding. [[H8394]]

### 13
When He thunders, [[H6963]] the waters [[H4325]] in the heavens [[H8064]] roar, [[H1995]] and He causes the clouds [[H5387]] to rise [[H5927]] from the ends [[H7097]] of the earth. [[H776]] He sends [[H6213]] lightning [[H1300]] with the rain [[H4306]] and brings [[H3318]] the wind [[H7307]] from His storehouses. [[H214]]

### 14
Everyone [[H3605]] is senseless [[H1197]] and devoid of knowledge. [[H1847]] Every [[H3605]] goldsmith [[H6884]] is put to shame [[H3001]] by his idols. [[H6459]] For [[H3588]] his molten images [[H5262]] are a fraud; [[H8267]] they have no [[H3808]] breath in them. [[H7307]]

### 15
They [[H1992]] are worthless, [[H1892]] a work [[H4639]] to be mocked. [[H8595]] In the time [[H6256]] of their punishment, [[H6486]] they will perish. [[H6]]

### 16
The Portion [[H2506]] of Jacob [[H3290]] is not [[H3808]] like these, [[H428]] for [[H3588]] He [[H1931]] is the Maker [[H3335]] of all things: [[H3605]] Israel [[H3478]] is the tribe [[H7626]] of His inheritance; [[H5159]] the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts [[H6635]] is His name. [[H8034]]

### 17
Gather up [[H622]] your belongings [[H3666]] from this land, [[H776]] you who live [[H3427]] under siege. [[H4692]]

### 18
For [[H3588]] this is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3069]] says: [[H559]] “Behold, [[H2005]] at this [[H2063]] time [[H6471]] I will sling out [[H7049]] the inhabitants [[H3427]] of the land [[H776]] and bring distress on them [[H6887]] so that they [[H4616]] may be captured.” [[H4672]]

### 19
Woe [[H188]] to me because of [[H5921]] my brokenness; [[H7667]] my wound [[H4347]] is grievous! [[H2470]] But I [[H589]] said, [[H559]] “This [[H2088]] is truly my sickness, [[H2483]] and I must bear it.” [[H5375]]

### 20
My tent [[H168]] is destroyed, [[H7703]] and all [[H3605]] its ropes [[H4340]] are snapped. [[H5423]] My sons [[H1121]] have departed from me [[H3318]] and are no more. [[H369]] I have no one [[H369]] left [[H5750]] to pitch [[H5186]] my tent [[H168]] or set up [[H6965]] my curtains. [[H3407]]

### 21
For [[H3588]] the shepherds [[H7462]] have become senseless [[H1197]] and [[H853]] do not [[H3808]] seek [[H1875]] the LORD. [[H3068]] Therefore [[H5921]] they have not [[H3808]] prospered, [[H7919]] and all their [[H3605]] flock [[H4830]] is scattered. [[H6327]]

### 22
Listen! [[H2009]] The sound [[H6963]] of a report [[H8052]] is coming— [[H935]] a great [[H1419]] commotion [[H7494]] from the land [[H776]] to the north. [[H6828]] The cities [[H5892]] of Judah [[H3063]] will be made [[H7760]] a desolation, [[H8077]] a haunt [[H4583]] of jackals. [[H8577]]

### 23
I know, [[H3045]] O LORD, [[H3068]] that [[H3588]] a man’s [[H120]] way [[H1870]] is not his own; [[H3808]] no [[H3808]] one [[H376]] who walks [[H1980]] directs [[H3559]] his own steps. [[H6806]]

### 24
Correct me, [[H3256]] O LORD, [[H3068]] but only [[H389]] with justice— [[H4941]] not [[H408]] in Your anger, [[H639]] or [[H6435]] You will bring me to nothing. [[H4591]]

### 25
Pour out [[H8210]] Your wrath [[H2534]] on [[H5921]] the nations [[H1471]] that [[H834]] do not [[H3808]] acknowledge You, [[H3045]] and on [[H5921]] the families [[H4940]] that [[H834]] do not [[H3808]] call [[H7121]] on Your name. [[H8034]] For [[H3588]] they have devoured [[H398]] Jacob; [[H3290]] they have consumed him [[H398]] and finished him off; [[H3615]] they have devastated [[H8074]] his homeland. [[H5116]]
