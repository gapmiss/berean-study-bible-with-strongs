### 1
“Woe [[H1945]] to the shepherds [[H7462]] who destroy [[H6]] and scatter [[H6327]] the sheep [[H6629]] of My pasture!” [[H4830]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD. [[H3068]]

### 2
Therefore, [[H3651]] this is what [[H3541]] the LORD, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] says [[H559]] about [[H5921]] the shepherds [[H7462]] who tend [[H7462]] My people: [[H5971]] “You [[H859]] have scattered [[H6327]] My flock [[H6629]] and driven them away, [[H5080]] and have not [[H3808]] attended to them. [[H6485]] Behold, [[H2005]] I will attend [[H6485]] to [[H5921]] you [[H853]] for the evil [[H7455]] of your deeds, [[H4611]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD. [[H3068]]

### 3
Then I Myself [[H589]] will gather [[H6908]] the remnant [[H7611]] of My flock [[H6629]] from all [[H3605]] the lands [[H776]] to which [[H834]] I have banished them, [[H5080]] and I will return them [[H7725]] to [[H5921]] their pasture, [[H5116]] where they will be fruitful [[H6509]] and multiply. [[H7235]]

### 4
I will raise up [[H6965]] shepherds [[H7462]] over them [[H5921]] who will tend them, [[H7462]] and they will no [[H3808]] longer [[H5750]] be afraid [[H3372]] or dismayed, [[H2865]] nor [[H3808]] will any go missing, [[H6485]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD. [[H3068]]

### 5
Behold, [[H2009]] the days [[H3117]] are coming, [[H935]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD, [[H3068]] when I will raise up [[H6965]] for David [[H1732]] a Righteous [[H6662]] Branch, [[H6780]] and He will reign [[H4427]] wisely [[H7919]] as king [[H4428]] and administer [[H6213]] justice [[H4941]] and righteousness [[H6666]] in the land. [[H776]]

### 6
In His days [[H3117]] Judah [[H3063]] will be saved, [[H3467]] and Israel [[H3478]] will dwell [[H7931]] securely. [[H983]] And this [[H2088]] is His name [[H8034]] by which [[H834]] He will be called: [[H7121]] The LORD [[H3068]] Our Righteousness. [[H6664]]

### 7
So [[H3651]] behold, [[H2009]] [the] days [[H3117]] are coming, [[H935]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD, [[H3068]] when they will no [[H3808]] longer [[H5750]] say, [[H559]] ‘As surely as the LORD [[H3068]] lives, [[H2416]] who [[H834]] brought [[H5927]] the Israelites [[H1121]] out of the land [[H776]] of Egypt.’ [[H4714]]

### 8
Instead, [[H3588]] [they will say], [[H518]] ‘As surely as the LORD [[H3068]] lives, [[H2416]] who [[H834]] brought [[H5927]] and led [[H935]] the descendants [[H2233]] of the house [[H1004]] of Israel [[H3478]] from the land [[H776]] of the north [[H6828]] and from all [[H3605]] the other countries [[H776]] to which [[H834]] I had banished them.’ [[H5080]] They will dwell [[H3427]] once more in [[H5921]] their own land.” [[H127]]

### 9
As for the prophets: [[H5030]] My heart [[H3820]] is broken [[H7665]] within me, [[H7130]] and all [[H3605]] my bones [[H6106]] tremble. [[H7363]] I have become [[H1961]] like a drunkard, [[H376]] like a man [[H1397]] overcome [[H5674]] by wine, [[H3196]] because of [[H6440]] the LORD, [[H3068]] because of [[H6440]] His holy [[H6944]] words. [[H1697]]

### 10
For [[H3588]] the land [[H776]] is full of [[H4390]] adulterers— [[H5003]] because of [[H6440]] the curse [[H423]] the land [[H776]] mourns, [[H56]] and the pastures [[H4999]] of the wilderness [[H4057]] have dried up— [[H3001]] their course [[H4794]] is [[H1961]] evil [[H7451]] and their power [[H1369]] is misused. [[H3808]]

### 11
“For [[H3588]] both [[H1571]] prophet [[H5030]] and [[H1571]] priest [[H3548]] are ungodly; [[H2610]] even [[H1571]] in My house [[H1004]] I have found [[H4672]] their wickedness,” [[H7451]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD. [[H3068]]

### 12
“Therefore [[H3651]] their path [[H1870]] will become [[H1961]] slick; [[H2519]] they will be driven away [[H1760]] into the gloom [[H653]] and fall [[H5307]] into it.  For [[H3588]] I will bring [[H935]] disaster [[H7451]] upon them [[H5921]] in the year [[H8141]] of their punishment,” [[H6486]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD. [[H3069]]

### 13
“Among the prophets [[H5030]] of Samaria [[H8111]] I saw [[H7200]] an offensive thing: [[H8604]] They prophesied [[H5012]] by Baal [[H1168]] and led My people [[H5971]] Israel [[H3478]] astray. [[H8582]]

### 14
And among the prophets [[H5030]] of Jerusalem [[H3389]] I have seen [[H7200]] a horrible thing: [[H8186]] They commit adultery [[H5003]] and walk [[H1980]] in lies. [[H8267]] They strengthen [[H2388]] the hands [[H3027]] of evildoers, [[H7489]] so that no [[H1115]] one [[H376]] turns his back [[H7725]] on wickedness. [[H7451]] They are [[H1961]] all [[H3605]] like Sodom to Me; [[H5467]] the people of Jerusalem [[H3427]] are like Gomorrah. [[H6017]]

### 15
Therefore, [[H3651]] this is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts [[H6635]] says [[H559]] concerning [[H5921]] the prophets: [[H5030]] “I will feed [[H398]] them wormwood [[H3939]] and give them poisoned [[H7219]] water [[H4325]] to drink, [[H8248]] for [[H3588]] from the prophets [[H5030]] of Jerusalem [[H3389]] ungodliness [[H2613]] has spread [[H3318]] throughout the land.” [[H776]]

### 16
This is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts [[H6635]] says: [[H559]] “Do not [[H408]] listen [[H8085]] to [[H5921]] the words [[H1697]] of the prophets [[H5030]] who prophesy [[H5012]] to you.  They are filling you with false hopes. [[H1891]] They speak [[H1696]] visions [[H2377]] from their own minds, [[H3820]] not [[H3808]] from the mouth [[H6310]] of the LORD. [[H3068]]

### 17
They keep saying [[H559]] to those who despise Me, [[H5006]] ‘The LORD [[H3068]] says that [[H1696]] you will have [[H1961]] peace,’ [[H7965]] [and] [[H559]] to everyone [[H3605]] who walks [[H1980]] in the stubbornness [[H8307]] of his own heart, [[H3820]] ‘No [[H3808]] harm [[H7451]] will come [[H935]] to you.’ [[H5921]]

### 18
But [[H3588]] which of them [[H4310]] has stood [[H5975]] in the council [[H5475]] of the LORD [[H3068]] to see [[H7200]] and hear [[H8085]] His word? [[H1697]] Who [[H4310]] has given heed [[H7181]] to His word [[H1697]] and obeyed it? [[H8085]]

### 19
Behold, [[H2009]] the storm [[H5591]] of the LORD [[H3068]] has gone out [[H3318]] in fury, [[H2534]] a whirlwind [[H2342]] swirling down [[H2342]] upon [[H5921]] the heads [[H7218]] of the wicked. [[H7563]]

### 20
The anger [[H639]] of the LORD [[H3068]] will not [[H3808]] diminish [[H7725]] until [[H5704]] He has fully accomplished [[H6213]] the purposes [[H4209]] of His heart. [[H3820]] In the days [[H3117]] to come [[H319]] you will understand [[H995]] it clearly. [[H998]]

### 21
I did not [[H3808]] send [[H7971]] these prophets, [[H5030]] yet they [[H1992]] have run with their message; [[H7323]] I did not [[H3808]] speak [[H1696]] to them, [[H413]] yet they [[H1992]] prophesied. [[H5012]]

### 22
But if [[H518]] they had stood [[H5975]] in My council, [[H5475]] they would have proclaimed [[H8085]] My words [[H1697]] to My people [[H5971]] and turned them back [[H7725]] from their evil [[H7451]] ways [[H1870]] and evil [[H7455]] deeds.” [[H4611]]

### 23
“Am I [only] [[H589]] a God [[H430]] nearby,” [[H7138]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD, [[H3068]] “and not [[H3808]] a God [[H430]] far away?” [[H7350]]

### 24
“Can [[H518]] a man [[H376]] hide [[H5641]] in secret places [[H4565]] where I [[H589]] cannot [[H3808]] see him?” [[H7200]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD. [[H3068]] “Do I [[H589]] not [[H3808]] fill [[H4390]] the heavens [[H8064]] and [[H853]] earth?” [[H776]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD. [[H3068]]

### 25
“I have heard [[H8085]] the sayings [[H559]] of the prophets [[H5030]] who prophesy [[H5012]] lies [[H8267]] in My name: [[H8034]] ‘I had a dream! [[H2492]] I had a dream!’ [[H2492]]

### 26
How long [[H5704]] will this continue [[H3426]] in the hearts [[H3820]] of these prophets [[H5030]] who prophesy [[H5012]] falsehood, [[H8267]] these prophets [[H5030]] of the delusion [[H8649]] of their own minds? [[H3820]]

### 27
They suppose [[H2803]] the dreams [[H2472]] that [[H834]] they tell [[H5608]] one [[H376]] another [[H7453]] will make My people [[H5971]] forget [[H7911]] My name, [[H8034]] just as [[H834]] their fathers [[H1]] forgot [[H7911]] My name [[H8034]] through the worship of Baal. [[H1168]]

### 28
Let the prophet [[H5030]] who [[H834]] has [[H854]] a dream [[H2472]] retell [[H5608]] [it], [[H2472]] but let him who [[H834]] has [[H854]] My word [[H1697]] speak [[H1696]] [it] [[H1697]] truthfully. [[H571]] For what [[H4100]] is straw [[H8401]] compared to [[H854]] grain? [[H1250]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD. [[H3068]]

### 29
Is not [[H3808]] My word [[H1697]] like fire, [[H784]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD, [[H3068]] and like a hammer [[H6360]] that smashes [[H6327]] a rock?” [[H5553]]

### 30
“Therefore [[H3651]] behold,” [[H2005]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD, [[H3068]] “I am against [[H5921]] the prophets [[H5030]] who steal [[H1589]] from each [[H376]] other [[H7453]] words [they attribute] to Me.” [[H1697]]

### 31
“Yes,” [[H2005]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD, [[H3068]] “I am against [[H5921]] the prophets [[H5030]] who wag [[H3947]] their own tongues [[H3956]] and proclaim, [[H5001]] ‘[The Lord] declares [it].’” [[H5002]]

### 32
“Indeed,” [[H2005]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD, [[H3068]] “I am against [[H5921]] those who prophesy [[H5012]] FALSE [[H8267]] dreams [[H2472]] they tell [[H5608]] to lead My people [[H5971]] astray [[H8582]] with their reckless [[H6350]] lies. [[H8267]] It was not [[H3808]] I [[H595]] who sent [[H7971]] or commanded them, [[H6680]] and they are of no [[H3808]] benefit [[H3276]] at all [[H3276]] to these [[H2088]] people,” [[H5971]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD. [[H3068]]

### 33
“Now when [[H3588]] this [[H2088]] people, [[H5971]] or [[H176]] a prophet [[H5030]] or [[H176]] a priest, [[H3548]] asks you, [[H7592]] ‘What [[H4100]] is the oracle [[H4853]] of the LORD?’ [[H3068]] you are to say [[H559]] to them: [[H413]] ‘What [[H4100]] oracle? [[H4853]] I will forsake [[H5203]] you, [[H853]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD.’ [[H3068]]

### 34
As for the prophet [[H5030]] [or] priest [[H3548]] [or] anyone [[H5971]] who [[H834]] claims, [[H559]] ‘This is the oracle [[H4853]] of the LORD,’ [[H3068]] I will punish [[H6485]] that [[H1931]] man [[H376]] and his household. [[H1004]]

### 35
This is what [[H3541]] each man [[H376]] is to say [[H559]] to [[H5921]] his friend [[H7453]] and to [[H413]] his brother: [[H251]] ‘What [[H4100]] has the LORD [[H3068]] answered?’ [[H6030]] or, ‘What [[H4100]] has the LORD [[H3068]] spoken?’ [[H1696]]

### 36
But no [[H3808]] longer [[H5750]] refer to [[H2142]] the oracle [[H4853]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] for [[H3588]] each [[H376]] man’s word [[H1697]] becomes [[H1961]] the oracle, [[H4853]] so that you pervert [[H2015]] the words [[H1697]] of the living [[H2416]] God, [[H430]] the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts, [[H6635]] our God. [[H430]]

### 37
Thus [[H3541]] you are to say [[H559]] to [[H413]] the prophet: [[H5030]] ‘What [[H4100]] has the LORD [[H3068]] answered you?’ [[H6030]] and, ‘What [[H4100]] has the LORD [[H3068]] spoken?’ [[H1696]]

### 38
But if [[H518]] you claim, [[H559]] ‘This is the oracle [[H4853]] of the LORD,’ [[H3068]] then [[H3651]] this is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] says: [[H559]] Because [[H3282]] you have said, [[H559]] ‘This is the oracle [[H4853]] of the LORD,’ [[H3068]] and I specifically told [[H7971]] you not [[H3808]] to make this claim, [[H559]]

### 39
therefore [[H3651]] I will surely [[H2005]] forget [[H5382]] you [[H853]] and cast you [[H5203]] out of [[H5921]] My presence, [[H6440]] both you and the city [[H5892]] that [[H834]] I gave [[H5414]] to you  and your fathers. [[H1]]

### 40
And I will bring [[H5414]] upon you [[H5921]] everlasting [[H5769]] shame [[H2781]] and perpetual [[H5769]] humiliation [[H3640]] that [[H834]] will never [[H3808]] be forgotten.” [[H7911]]
