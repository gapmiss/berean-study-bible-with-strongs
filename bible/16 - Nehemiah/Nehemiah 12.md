###### 38

###### 39
over [[H5921]] the Gate [[H8179]] of Ephraim, [[H669]] the Jeshanah Gate, [[H3466]] the Fish [[H1709]] Gate, [[H8179]] the Tower [[H4026]] of Hananel, [[H2606]] and the Tower [[H4026]] of the Hundred, [[H3968]] as far [[H5704]] as the Sheep [[H6629]] Gate. [[H8179]] And they stopped [[H5975]] at the Gate [[H8179]] of the Guard. [[H4307]]

###### 40
The two [[H8147]] thanksgiving [choirs] [[H8426]] then stood [[H5975]] in the house [[H1004]] of God, [[H430]] as did I, [[H589]] along with the half [[H2677]] of the officials [[H5461]] accompanying me, [[H5973]]

###### 43
On that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] they offered [[H2076]] great [[H1419]] sacrifices, [[H2077]] rejoicing [[H8055]] because [[H3588]] God [[H430]] had given them great [[H1419]] joy. [[H8055]] The women [[H802]] and children [[H3206]] also [[H1571]] rejoiced, [[H8055]] so that the joy [[H8057]] of Jerusalem [[H3389]] was heard [[H8085]] from afar. [[H7350]]

###### 44
And on that same [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] men [[H376]] were appointed [[H6485]] over [[H5921]] the rooms [[H5393]] that housed the supplies, [[H214]] contributions, [[H8641]] firstfruits, [[H7225]] and tithes. [[H4643]] The portions [specified] by [[H4521]] the Law [[H8451]] for the priests [[H3548]] and Levites [[H3881]] were gathered [[H3664]] into [these storerooms]  from the fields [[H7704]] of the villages, [[H5892]] because [[H3588]] Judah [[H3063]] rejoiced [[H8057]] over [[H5921]] the priests [[H3548]] and Levites [[H3881]] who were serving. [[H5975]]

###### 45
They performed [[H8104]] the service [[H4931]] of their God [[H430]] and the service [[H4931]] of purification, [[H2893]] along with the singers [[H7891]] and gatekeepers, [[H7778]] as David [[H1732]] and his son [[H1121]] Solomon [[H8010]] had prescribed. [[H4687]]

###### 46
For [[H3588]] long ago, [[H6924]] in the days [[H3117]] of David [[H1732]] and Asaph, [[H623]] there were directors [[H7218]] for the singers [[H7891]] and for the songs [[H7892]] of praise [[H8416]] and thanksgiving [[H3034]] to God. [[H430]]

###### 47
So in the days [[H3117]] of Zerubbabel [[H2216]] and Nehemiah, [[H5166]] all [[H3605]] Israel [[H3478]] contributed [[H5414]] the daily portions [[H4521]] for the singers [[H7891]] and gatekeepers. [[H7778]] They also set aside [[H6942]] daily [[H3117]] portions [[H1697]] for the Levites, [[H3881]] and the Levites [[H3881]] set aside [[H6942]] daily portions for the descendants [[H1121]] of Aaron.
