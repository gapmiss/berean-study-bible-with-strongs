###### 1
When [[H834]] Sanballat, [[H5571]] Tobiah, [[H2900]] Geshem [[H1654]] the Arab, [[H6163]] and the rest [[H3499]] of our enemies [[H341]] heard [[H8085]] that [[H3588]] I had rebuilt [[H1129]] the wall [[H2346]] and not [[H3808]] a gap [[H6556]] was left— [[H3498]] though [[H1571]] to [[H5704]] that [[H1931]] time [[H6256]] I had not yet [[H3808]] installed [[H5975]] the doors [[H1817]] in the gates— [[H8179]]

###### 2
Sanballat [[H5571]] and Geshem [[H1654]] sent [[H7971]] me this message: [[H559]] “Come, [[H1980]] let us meet [[H3259]] together [[H3162]] in [one of] the villages [[H3715]] on the plain [[H1237]] of Ono.” [[H207]] But they [[H1992]] were planning [[H2803]] to harm [[H6213]] me. [[H7451]]

###### 3
So I sent [[H7971]] messengers [[H4397]] to them, [[H5921]] saying, [[H559]] “I [[H589]] am doing [[H6213]] a great [[H1419]] work [[H4399]] and cannot [[H3808]] come down. [[H3381]] Why [[H4100]] should the work [[H4399]] stop [[H7673]] while [[H834]] I leave it [[H7503]] to go down [[H3381]] to you?” [[H413]]

###### 4
Four [[H702]] times [[H6471]] they sent [[H7971]] me the same [[H2088]] message, [[H1697]] and each time I gave [[H7725]] the same [[H2088]] reply. [[H1697]]

###### 5
The fifth [[H2549]] time, [[H6471]] Sanballat [[H5571]] sent [[H7971]] me this [[H2088]] same message [[H1697]] by his young servant, [[H5288]] who had in his hand [[H3027]] an unsealed [[H6605]] letter [[H107]]

###### 6
that read: [[H3789]] “It is reported [[H8085]] among the nations— [[H1471]] and Geshem [[H1654]] agrees— [[H559]] that you [[H859]] and the Jews [[H3064]] are plotting [[H2803]] to revolt, [[H4775]] [and] this is why [[H5921]] you [[H859]] are building [[H1129]] the wall. [[H2346]] According to these [[H428]] reports, [[H1697]] you [[H859]] are to become [[H1933]] their  king, [[H4428]]

###### 7
and you have even [[H1571]] appointed [[H5975]] prophets [[H5030]] in Jerusalem [[H3389]] to proclaim [[H7121]] on your behalf: [[H5921]] ‘There is a king [[H4428]] in Judah.’ [[H3063]] Soon [[H6258]] these [[H428]] rumors [[H1697]] will reach the ears [[H8085]] of the king. [[H4428]] So [[H6258]] come, [[H1980]] let us confer [[H3289]] together.” [[H3162]]

###### 8
Then I sent [[H7971]] him [[H413]] this reply: [[H559]] “There is [[H1961]] nothing [[H3808]] to these [[H428]] rumors [[H1697]] you [[H859]] are spreading; [[H559]] you [[H859]] are inventing them [[H908]] in your own mind.” [[H3820]]

###### 9
For [[H3588]] they were all [[H3605]] [trying] to frighten [[H3372]] us, [[H853]] saying, [[H559]] “Their hands [[H3027]] will be weakened [[H7503]] in [[H4480]] the work, [[H4399]] and it will never [[H3808]] be finished.” [[H6213]] But now, my God, [[H6258]] strengthen [[H2388]] my hands. [[H3027]]

###### 10
Later, I [[H589]] went [[H935]] to the house [[H1004]] of Shemaiah [[H8098]] son [[H1121]] of Delaiah, [[H1806]] the son [[H1121]] of Mehetabel, [[H4105]] who [[H1931]] was confined [[H6113]] to his house. He said: [[H559]] “Let us meet [[H3259]] at [[H413]] the house [[H1004]] of God [[H430]] inside [[H413]] the temple. [[H1964]] Let us shut [[H5462]] the temple [[H1964]] doors [[H1817]] because [[H3588]] they are coming [[H935]] to kill you [[H2026]] by night [[H3915]] they are coming [[H935]] to kill you! [[H2026]]

###### 11
But I replied, [[H559]] “Should a man [[H376]] like me [[H3644]] run away? [[H1272]] Should [[H4310]] one like me [[H3644]] go [[H935]] into [[H413]] the temple [[H1964]] to save his own life? [[H2425]] I will not [[H3808]] go!” [[H935]]

###### 12
I realized [[H5234]] that God [[H430]] had not [[H3808]] sent him, [[H7971]] but that he had uttered [[H1696]] [this] prophecy [[H5016]] against me [[H5921]] because [[H3588]] Tobiah [[H2900]] and Sanballat [[H5571]] had hired him. [[H7936]]

###### 13
He [[H1931]] had been hired [[H7936]] to [[H4616]] intimidate me [[H3372]] so that I would sin [[H2398]] by doing [[H6213]] as he suggested, [[H3651]] so they could give me [[H1961]] a bad [[H7451]] name [[H8034]] in order to [[H4616]] discredit me. [[H2778]]

###### 14
O my God, [[H430]] remember [[H2142]] Tobiah [[H2900]] and Sanballat [[H5571]] for what they have done, [[H4639]] and also [[H1571]] Noadiah [[H5129]] the prophetess [[H5031]] and the other [[H3499]] prophets [[H5030]] who [[H834]] tried to intimidate me. [[H3372]]

###### 15
So the wall [[H2346]] was completed [[H7999]] in fifty-two [[H2572]] days, [[H3117]] on the twenty-fifth [[H6242]] of Elul. [[H435]]

###### 16
When [[H834]] all [[H3605]] our enemies [[H341]] heard about this, [[H8085]] all [[H3605]] the surrounding [[H5439]] nations [[H1471]] feared [[H834]] and were disheartened, [[H5307]] for they realized [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] this [[H2063]] task [[H4399]] had been accomplished [[H6213]] by [[H854]] our God. [[H430]]

###### 17
Also [[H1571]] in those [[H1992]] days, [[H3117]] the nobles [[H2715]] of Judah [[H3063]] sent many [[H7235]] letters [[H107]] to [[H5921]] Tobiah, [[H2900]] and Tobiah’s [[H2900]] letters [[H834]] came back [[H935]] to them. [[H413]]

###### 18
For [[H3588]] many [[H7227]] in Judah [[H3063]] were bound [[H1167]] by oath [[H7621]] to him,  since [[H3588]] he [[H1931]] was a son-in-law [[H2860]] of Shecaniah [[H7935]] son [[H1121]] of Arah, [[H733]] and his son [[H1121]] Jehohanan [[H3076]] had married [[H3947]] the daughter [[H1323]] of Meshullam [[H4918]] son [[H1121]] of Berechiah. [[H1296]]

###### 19
Moreover, [[H1571]] these nobles kept [[H1961]] reporting [[H559]] to me [[H6440]] Tobiah’s good deeds, [[H2896]] and they relayed [[H3318]] my words [[H1697]] to him.  And Tobiah [[H2900]] sent [[H7971]] letters [[H107]] to intimidate me. [[H3372]]
