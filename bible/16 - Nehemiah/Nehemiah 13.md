# Nehemiah 13

[[Nehemiah 12|←]] • [[Esther 1|→]]

---

### 1
At that [[H1931]] time [[H3117]] the Book [[H5612]] of Moses [[H4872]] was read aloud [[H7121]] in the hearing [[H241]] of the people, [[H5971]] and in it  they found [[H4672]] the passage stating [[H3789]] that [[H834]] no [[H3808]] Ammonite [[H5984]] or Moabite [[H4125]] should ever [[H5704]] enter [[H935]] the assembly [[H6951]] of God, [[H430]]

### 2
because [[H3588]] they had not [[H3808]] met [[H6923]] the Israelites [[H1121]] with food [[H3899]] and water, [[H4325]] but had hired [[H7936]] Balaam [[H1109]] to call down a curse [[H7043]] against them [[H5921]] (although our God [[H430]] had turned [[H2015]] the curse [[H7045]] into a blessing). [[H1293]]

### 3
As soon as [[H1961]] [the people] heard [[H8085]] this law, [[H8451]] they excluded [[H914]] from Israel [[H3478]] all [[H3605]] of foreign descent. [[H6154]]

### 4
Now before [[H6440]] this, [[H2088]] Eliashib [[H475]] the priest, [[H3548]] a relative [[H7138]] of Tobiah, [[H2900]] had been put in charge of [[H5414]] the storerooms [[H3957]] of the house [[H1004]] of our God [[H430]]

### 5
and had prepared [[H6213]] for [Tobiah]  a large [[H1419]] room [[H3957]] where [[H8033]] they had previously [[H6440]] stored [[H5414]] the grain offerings, [[H4503]] the incense, [[H3828]] the [temple] articles, [[H3627]] and the tithes [[H4643]] of grain, [[H1715]] new wine, [[H8492]] and oil [[H3323]] prescribed [[H4687]] for the Levites, [[H3881]] singers, [[H7891]] and gatekeepers, [[H7778]] along with the contributions [[H8641]] for the priests. [[H3548]]

### 6
While all [[H3605]] this [[H2088]] was happening, [[H1961]] I was not [[H3808]] in Jerusalem, [[H3389]] because [[H3588]] I had returned [[H935]] to [[H413]] King [[H4428]] Artaxerxes [[H783]] of Babylon [[H894]] in the thirty-second [[H7970]] year [[H8141]] of his reign. [[H4428]] Some time later [[H7093]] I obtained leave [[H7592]] from [[H4480]] the king [[H4428]]

### 7
to return [[H935]] to Jerusalem. [[H3389]] Then I discovered [[H995]] the evil [[H7451]] that [[H834]] Eliashib [[H475]] had done [[H6213]] on behalf of Tobiah [[H2900]] by providing [[H6213]] him a room [[H5393]] in the courts [[H2691]] of the house [[H1004]] of God. [[H430]]

### 8
And I was greatly [[H3966]] displeased [[H7489]] and threw [[H7993]] all [[H3605]] of Tobiah’s [[H2900]] household [[H1004]] goods [[H3627]] out [[H2351]] of [[H4480]] the room. [[H3957]]

### 9
Then I ordered [[H559]] that the rooms [[H3957]] be purified, [[H2891]] and I had the articles [[H3627]] of the house [[H1004]] of God [[H430]] restored [[H7725]] to them, [[H8033]] along with the grain offerings [[H4503]] and incense. [[H3828]]

### 10
I also learned [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] because the portions [[H4521]] for the Levites [[H3881]] had not [[H3808]] been given them, [[H5414]] all [[H376]] the Levites [[H3881]] and singers [[H7891]] responsible for performing [[H6213]] the service [[H4399]] had gone back [[H1272]] to their own fields. [[H7704]]

### 11
So I rebuked [[H7378]] the officials [[H5461]] and asked, [[H559]] “Why [[H4069]] has the house [[H1004]] of God [[H430]] been neglected?” [[H5800]] Then I gathered the Levites and singers together [[H6908]] and stationed [[H5975]] them at [[H5921]] their posts, [[H5977]]

### 12
and all [[H3605]] Judah [[H3063]] brought [[H935]] a tenth [[H4643]] of the grain, [[H1715]] new wine, [[H8492]] and oil [[H3323]] into the storerooms. [[H214]]

### 13
I appointed as treasurers [[H686]] over [[H5921]] the storerooms [[H214]] Shelemiah [[H8018]] the priest, [[H3548]] Zadok [[H6659]] the scribe, [[H5608]] and Pedaiah [[H6305]] of [[H4480]] the Levites, [[H3881]] with Hanan [[H2605]] son [[H1121]] of Zaccur, [[H2139]] the son [[H1121]] of Mattaniah, [[H4983]] to assist [[H5921]] them, [[H3027]] because [[H3588]] they were considered [[H2803]] trustworthy. [[H539]] They were responsible for [[H5921]] distributing the supplies [[H2505]] to their fellow [Levites]. [[H251]]

### 14
Remember [[H2142]] me for [[H5921]] this, [[H2063]] O my God, [[H430]] and do not [[H408]] blot out [[H4229]] my deeds of loving devotion [[H2617]] for the house [[H1004]] of my God [[H430]] and for its services. [[H4929]]

### 15
In those [[H1992]] days [[H3117]] I saw [[H7200]] people in Judah [[H3063]] treading [[H1869]] wine presses [[H1660]] on the Sabbath [[H7676]] and bringing in [[H935]] grain [[H6194]] and loading it [[H6006]] on [[H5921]] donkeys, [[H2543]] along with [[H637]] wine, [[H3196]] grapes, [[H6025]] and figs. [[H8384]] All kinds [[H3605]] of goods [[H4853]] were being brought [[H935]] into Jerusalem [[H3389]] on the Sabbath [[H7676]] day. [[H3117]] So I warned them [[H5749]] against selling [[H4376]] food [[H6718]] on that day. [[H3117]]

### 16
Additionally, [men of] Tyre [[H6876]] who lived [[H3427]] there  were importing [[H935]] fish [[H1709]] and all kinds [[H3605]] of merchandise [[H4377]] and selling them [[H4376]] on the Sabbath [[H7676]] to the people [[H1121]] of Judah [[H3063]] in Jerusalem. [[H3389]]

### 17
Then I rebuked [[H7378]] the nobles [[H2715]] of Judah [[H3063]] and asked, [[H559]] “What [[H4100]] is this [[H2088]] evil [[H7451]] you [[H859]] are doing— [[H6213]] profaning [[H2490]] the Sabbath [[H7676]] day? [[H3117]]

### 18
Did not [[H3808]] your forefathers [[H1]] do [[H6213]] the same things, [[H3541]] so that our God [[H430]] brought [[H935]] all [[H3605]] this [[H2063]] disaster [[H7451]] on us [[H5921]] and on [[H5921]] this [[H2063]] city? [[H5892]] And now [[H859]] you are rekindling [[H935]] His wrath [[H2740]] against [[H5921]] Israel [[H3478]] by profaning [[H2490]] the Sabbath!” [[H7676]]

### 19
When [[H834]] the evening shadows [[H6751]] began to fall on the gates [[H8179]] of Jerusalem, [[H3389]] just before [[H6440]] the Sabbath, [[H7676]] I ordered [[H559]] that the gates [[H1817]] be shut [[H5462]] and not [[H3808]] opened [[H6605]] until [[H5704]] after [[H310]] the Sabbath. [[H7676]] I posted [[H5975]] some of my servants [[H5288]] at [[H5921]] the gates, [[H8179]] so that no [[H3808]] goods [[H4853]] could enter [[H935]] on the Sabbath [[H7676]] day. [[H3117]]

### 20
Once [[H6471]] or twice, [[H8147]] the merchants [[H7402]] and those who sell [[H4376]] all kinds [[H3605]] of goods [[H4465]] camped [[H3885]] outside [[H2351]] Jerusalem, [[H3389]]

### 21
but I warned them, [[H5749]] “Why [[H4069]] are you [[H859]] camping [[H3885]] in front of [[H5048]] the wall? [[H2346]] If [[H518]] you do it again, [[H8138]] I will lay hands [[H3027]] on you.” [[H7971]] From [[H4480]] that [[H1931]] time on, [[H6256]] they did not [[H3808]] return [[H935]] on the Sabbath. [[H7676]]

### 22
Then I instructed [[H559]] the Levites [[H3881]] to purify themselves [[H2891]] and guard [[H8104]] the gates [[H8179]] in order to keep the Sabbath [[H7676]] day [[H3117]] holy. [[H6942]] Remember [[H2142]] me for this [[H2063]] as well, [[H1571]] O my God, [[H430]] and {show} me [[H5921]] mercy [[H2347]] according to Your abundant [[H7230]] loving devotion. [[H2617]]

### 23
In those [[H1992]] days [[H3117]] I also [[H1571]] saw [[H7200]] Jews [[H3064]] who had married [[H3427]] women [[H802]] from Ashdod, [[H796]] Ammon, [[H5984]] and Moab. [[H4125]]

### 24
Half [[H2677]] of their children [[H1121]] spoke [[H1696]] the language of Ashdod [[H797]] or of [[H3956]] the other peoples, [[H5971]] but could not [[H369]] speak [[H1696]] Hebrew. [[H3066]]

### 25
I rebuked them [[H7378]] and called down curses on them. [[H7043]] I beat [[H5221]] some of [[H1992]] these men [[H376]] and pulled out their hair. [[H4803]] Then I made them take an oath [[H7650]] before God [and said]: [[H430]] “You must not [[H518]] give your daughters [[H1323]] in marriage [[H5414]] to their sons [[H1121]] or take [[H5375]] their daughters [[H1323]] as wives for your sons [[H1121]] or for yourselves! 

### 26
Did not [[H3808]] King [[H4428]] Solomon [[H8010]] of Israel [[H3478]] sin [[H2398]] in [[H5921]] matters like this? [[H428]] There was [[H1961]] not [[H3808]] a king [[H4428]] like him [[H3644]] among many [[H7227]] nations. [[H1471]] He was [[H1961]] loved [[H157]] by his God, [[H430]] and God [[H430]] made [[H5414]] him king [[H4428]] over [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] Israel, [[H3478]] yet [[H1571]] foreign [[H5237]] women [[H802]] drew him into sin. [[H2398]]

### 27
Why should we now hear [[H8085]] that you too are doing [[H6213]] all [[H3605]] this [[H2063]] terrible [[H1419]] evil [[H7451]] and acting unfaithfully [[H4603]] against our God [[H430]] by marrying [[H3427]] foreign [[H5237]] women?” [[H802]]

### 28
Even one of the sons [[H1121]] of Jehoiada [[H3111]] son [[H1121]] of Eliashib [[H475]] the high [[H1419]] priest [[H3548]] had become a son-in-law [[H2860]] to Sanballat [[H5571]] the Horonite. [[H2772]] Therefore I drove him away [[H1272]] from me. [[H5921]]

### 29
Remember [[H2142]] them, [[H1992]] O my God, [[H430]] because [[H5921]] they have defiled [[H1352]] the priesthood [[H3550]] and the covenant [[H1285]] of the priesthood [[H3550]] and of the Levites. [[H3881]]

### 30
Thus I purified [the priests and Levites] [[H2891]] from everything [[H3605]] foreign, [[H5236]] and I assigned [[H5975]] specific [[H4399]] duties [[H4931]] to each [[H376]] of the priests [[H3548]] and Levites. [[H3881]]

### 31
I also arranged for contributions [[H7133]] of wood [[H6086]] at the appointed [[H2163]] times, [[H6256]] and for the firstfruits. [[H1061]] Remember me, [[H2142]] O my God, [[H430]] with favor. [[H2896]]
