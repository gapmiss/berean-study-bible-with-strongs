### 1
When [[H834]] the wall [[H2346]] had been rebuilt [[H1129]] and I had set the doors [[H1817]] in place, [[H5975]] the gatekeepers, [[H7778]] singers, [[H7891]] and Levites [[H3881]] were appointed. [[H6485]]

### 2
Then I put my brother [[H251]] Hanani [[H2607]] in charge [[H6680]] of [[H5921]] Jerusalem, [[H3389]] along with Hananiah [[H2608]] the commander [[H8269]] of the fortress, [[H1002]] because [[H3588]] he [[H1931]] was a faithful [[H571]] man [[H376]] who feared [[H3372]] God [[H430]] more than most. [[H7227]]

### 3
And  I told [[H559]] them,  “Do not [[H3808]] open [[H6605]] the gates [[H8179]] of Jerusalem [[H3389]] until [[H5704]] the sun [[H8121]] is hot. [[H2527]] While [[H5704]] the guards [[H1992]] are on duty, [[H5975]] keep the doors [[H1817]] shut [[H1479]] and securely fastened. [[H270]] And appoint [[H5975]] the residents [[H3427]] of Jerusalem [[H3389]] as guards, [[H4931]] some [[H376]] at their posts [[H4929]] and some [[H376]] at [[H5048]] their own homes. [[H1004]]

### 4
Now the city [[H5892]] was large [[H1419]] and spacious, [[H7342]] but there were few [[H4592]] people [[H5971]] in it, [[H8432]] and the houses [[H1004]] had not yet [[H369]] been rebuilt. [[H1129]]

### 5
Then my God [[H430]] put [[H5414]] into [[H413]] my heart [[H3820]] to assemble [[H6908]] the nobles, [[H2715]] the officials, [[H5461]] and the people [[H5971]] to be enrolled by genealogy. [[H3187]] I found [[H4672]] the genealogical [[H3188]] register [[H5612]] of those who had first returned, [[H5927]] and I found [[H4672]] the following written [[H3789]] in it: 

### 6
These [[H428]] are the people [[H1121]] of the province [[H4082]] who came up [[H5927]] from the captivity [[H7628]] of the exiles [[H1473]] carried away [[H1540]] to Babylon [[H894]] by Nebuchadnezzar [[H5019]] [its] king.
