###### 1
Now [[H1961]] when [[H834]] Sanballat [[H5571]] heard [[H8085]] that [[H3588]] we [[H587]] were rebuilding [[H1129]] the wall, [[H2346]] he became furious [[H2734]] and was filled with indignation. [[H3707]] He ridiculed [[H3932]] the Jews [[H3064]]

###### 2
before [[H6440]] his associates [[H251]] and the army [[H2426]] of Samaria, [[H8111]] saying, [[H559]] “What [[H4100]] are these feeble [[H537]] Jews [[H3064]] doing? [[H6213]] Can they restore [the wall] by themselves? [[H5800]] Will they offer sacrifices? [[H2076]] Will they complete it [[H3615]] in a day? [[H3117]] Can they bring these [[H1992]] burnt [[H8313]] stones [[H68]] back to life [[H2421]] from the mounds [[H6194]] of rubble?” [[H6083]]

###### 3
Then Tobiah [[H2900]] the Ammonite, [[H5984]] who was beside him, [[H681]] said, [[H559]] “If [[H518]] even [[H1571]] a fox [[H7776]] were to climb up on [[H5927]] what [[H834]] they [[H1992]] are building, [[H1129]] it would break down [[H6555]] their wall [[H2346]] of stones!” [[H68]]

###### 4
Hear us, [[H8085]] O God, [[H430]] for [[H3588]] we are [[H1961]] despised. [[H939]] Turn [[H7725]] their scorn [[H2781]] back upon [[H413]] their own heads, [[H7218]] and let them be taken [[H5414]] as plunder [[H961]] to a land [[H776]] of captivity. [[H7633]]

###### 5
Do not [[H408]] cover up [[H3680]] their iniquity [[H5771]] or let their sin [[H2403]] be blotted out [[H4229]] from Your sight, [[H6440]] for [[H3588]] they have provoked [[H3707]] the builders. [[H1129]]

###### 6
So we rebuilt [[H1129]] the wall [[H2346]] until all [[H3605]] [of it] [[H2346]] was joined together [[H7194]] up to [[H5704]] half its [height], [[H2677]] for the people [[H5971]] had [[H1961]] a mind [[H3820]] to work. [[H6213]]

###### 7
When [[H834]] Sanballat [[H5571]] and Tobiah, [[H2900]] together with the Arabs, [[H6163]] Ammonites, [[H5984]] and Ashdodites, [[H796]] heard [[H8085]] that [[H3588]] the repair [[H724]] to the walls [[H2346]] of Jerusalem [[H3389]] was progressing [[H5927]] and that [[H3588]] the gaps [[H6555]] were being closed, [[H5640]] they were furious, [[H2734]]

###### 8
and all of them [[H3605]] conspired [[H7194]] to come [[H935]] and fight [[H3898]] against Jerusalem [[H3389]] and create [[H6213]] a hindrance. [[H8442]]

###### 9
So we prayed [[H6419]] to [[H413]] our God [[H430]] and posted [[H5975]] a guard [[H4929]] against them [[H5921]] day [[H3119]] and night. [[H3915]]

###### 10
Meanwhile, the people of Judah [[H3063]] said: [[H559]] “The strength [[H3581]] of the laborer [[H5449]] fails, [[H3782]] and there is so much [[H7235]] rubble [[H6083]] that we [[H587]] will never [[H3808]] be able [[H3201]] to rebuild [[H1129]] the wall.” [[H2346]]

###### 11
And our enemies [[H6862]] said, [[H559]] “Before [[H5704]] they know [[H3045]] [or] [[H3808]] see [[H7200]] [a thing], [[H3808]] we will come [[H935]] into [[H413]] their midst, [[H8432]] kill them, [[H2026]] and put an end [[H7673]] to the work.” [[H4399]]

###### 12
At that time [[H1961]] the Jews [[H3064]] who lived [[H3427]] nearby [[H681]] came [[H935]] and told [[H559]] us  ten [[H6235]] times [over], [[H6471]] “Wherever [[H3605]] you turn, [[H7725]] they will attack us.” [[H5921]]

###### 13
So I stationed [men] [[H5975]] behind [[H310]] the lowest [[H8482]] sections [[H4725]] of the wall, [[H2346]] at the vulnerable areas. [[H6708]] I stationed [[H5975]] them [[H5971]] by families [[H4940]] with [[H5973]] their swords, [[H2719]] spears, [[H7420]] and bows. [[H7198]]

###### 14
After I had made an inspection, [[H7200]] I stood up [[H6965]] and said [[H559]] to [[H413]] the nobles, [[H2715]] the officials, [[H5461]] and the rest [[H3499]] of the people, [[H5971]] “Do not [[H408]] be afraid [[H3372]] of them. [[H6440]] Remember [[H2142]] the Lord, [[H136]] who is great [[H1419]] and awesome, [[H3372]] and fight [[H3898]] for [[H5921]] your brothers, [[H251]] your sons [[H1121]] and your daughters, [[H1323]] your wives [[H802]] and your homes. [[H1004]]

###### 15
When [[H834]] our enemies [[H341]] heard [[H8085]] that [[H3588]] we were aware [[H3045]] of their scheme [[H6098]] and that God [[H430]] had frustrated it, [[H6565]] each [[H3605]] of us returned [[H7725]] to [[H413]] his own work [[H4399]] on [[H413]] the wall. [[H2346]]

###### 16
And [[H1961]] from [[H4480]] that [[H1931]] day on, [[H3117]] half [[H2677]] of my men [[H5288]] did [[H6213]] the work [[H4399]] while the other half [[H2677]] held [[H2388]] spears, [[H7420]] shields, [[H4043]] bows, [[H7198]] and armor. [[H8302]] The officers [[H8269]] [stationed themselves] behind [[H310]] all [[H3605]] the people [[H1004]] of Judah [[H3063]]

###### 17
who were rebuilding [[H1129]] the wall. [[H2346]] The laborers who carried [[H5375]] materials [[H5447]] worked [[H6213]] with one [[H259]] hand [[H3027]] and held [[H2388]] a weapon [[H7973]] with the other. [[H259]]

###### 18
And each [[H376]] of the builders [[H1129]] worked [[H1129]] with his sword [[H2719]] strapped [[H631]] at [[H5921]] his side. [[H4975]] But the trumpeter [[H8628]] stayed beside me. [[H681]]

###### 19
Then I said [[H559]] to [[H413]] the nobles, [[H2715]] the officials, [[H5461]] and the rest [[H3499]] of the people: [[H5971]] “The work [is] [[H4399]] great [[H7235]] and extensive, [[H7342]] and we [[H587]] are spread out [[H6504]] far [[H7350]] from one [[H376]] another [[H251]] along [[H5921]] the wall. [[H2346]]

###### 20
Wherever [[H4725]] you hear [[H8085]] the sound [[H6963]] of the trumpet, [[H7782]] rally [[H6908]] to [[H413]] us there. [[H8033]] Our God [[H430]] will fight for us!” [[H3898]]

###### 21
So we [[H587]] continued [[H6213]] the work, [[H4399]] while half of [the men] [[H2677]] held [[H2388]] spears [[H7420]] from the break [[H5927]] of dawn [[H7837]] until [[H5704]] the stars [[H3556]] came out. [[H3318]]

###### 22
At that [[H1931]] time [[H6256]] I also [[H1571]] said [[H559]] to the people, [[H5971]] “Let every man [[H376]] and his servant [[H5288]] spend the night [[H3885]] inside [[H8432]] Jerusalem, [[H3389]] so that they can stand [[H1961]] guard [[H4929]] by night [[H3915]] and work [[H4399]] by day.” [[H3117]]

###### 23
So neither I [[H589]] nor brothers [[H251]] nor my men [[H5288]] nor the guards [[H376]] with me [[H310]] changed out of [[H6584]] our clothes; [[H899]] each carried his weapon, [[H7973]] [even to go] for water. [[H4325]]
