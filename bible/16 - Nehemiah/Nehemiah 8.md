At that time all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] gathered [[H622]] together [[H376]] at [[H413]] the square [[H7339]] before [[H6440]] the Water [[H4325]] Gate, [[H8179]] and they asked [[H559]] Ezra [[H5830]] the scribe [[H5608]] to bring [[H935]] the Book [[H5612]] of the Law [[H8451]] of Moses [[H4872]] that [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] had commanded [[H6680]] Israel. [[H3478]]

###### 2
On the first [[H259]] day [[H3117]] of the seventh [[H7637]] month, [[H2320]] Ezra [[H5830]] the priest [[H3548]] brought [[H935]] the Law [[H8451]] before [[H6440]] the assembly [[H6951]] of men [[H376]] and [[H5704]] women [[H802]] and all [[H3605]] who could listen [[H8085]] and understand. [[H995]]

###### 3
So [Ezra] read [[H7121]] it aloud  from [[H4480]] daybreak [[H216]] until [[H5704]] noon [[H4276]] as he faced [[H6440]] the square [[H7339]] before [[H6440]] the Water [[H4325]] Gate, [[H8179]] in front of [[H5048]] the men [[H376]] and women [[H802]] and those who could understand. [[H995]] And all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] listened attentively to [[H241]] the Book [[H5612]] of the Law. [[H8451]]

###### 4
Ezra [[H5830]] the scribe [[H5608]] stood [[H5975]] on [[H5921]] a high wooden [[H6086]] platform [[H4026]] built [[H6213]] for this occasion. [[H1697]] At his [[H681]] right side [[H3225]] stood [[H5975]] Mattithiah, [[H4993]] Shema, [[H8087]] Anaiah, [[H6043]] Uriah, [[H223]] Hilkiah, [[H2518]] and Maaseiah, [[H4641]] and at his left [[H8040]] were Pedaiah, [[H6305]] Mishael, [[H4332]] Malchijah, [[H4441]] Hashum, [[H2828]] Hash-baddanah, [[H2806]] Zechariah, [[H2148]] and Meshullam. [[H4918]]

###### 5
Ezra [[H5830]] opened [[H6605]] the book [[H5612]] in full view [[H5869]] of all [[H3605]] the people, [[H5971]] since [[H3588]] he was [[H1961]] standing above [[H5921]] them all, [[H3605]] and as he opened it, [[H6605]] all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] stood up. [[H5975]]

###### 6
Then Ezra [[H5830]] blessed [[H1288]] the LORD, [[H3068]] the great [[H1419]] God, [[H430]] and with their hands [[H3027]] uplifted, [[H4607]] all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] said, [[H6030]] “Amen, [[H543]] Amen!” [[H543]] Then they bowed down [[H6915]] and worshiped [[H7812]] the LORD [[H3068]] with their faces [[H639]] to the ground. [[H776]]

###### 7
The Levites— [[H3881]] Jeshua, [[H3442]] Bani, [[H1137]] Sherebiah, [[H8274]] Jamin, [[H3226]] Akkub, [[H6126]] Shabbethai, [[H7678]] Hodiah, [[H1941]] Maaseiah, [[H4641]] Kelita, [[H7042]] Azariah, [[H5838]] Jozabad, [[H3107]] Hanan, [[H2605]] and Pelaiah— [[H6411]] explained [[H995]] the law [[H8451]] to the people [[H5971]] as they stood in [[H5921]] their places. [[H5975]]

###### 8
So they read [[H7121]] from the Book [[H5612]] of the Law [[H8451]] of God, [[H430]] explaining it [[H6567]] and giving [[H7760]] insight, [[H7922]] so that the people could understand [[H995]] what was being read. [[H4744]]

###### 9
Nehemiah [[H5166]] the governor, [[H8660]] Ezra [[H5830]] the priest [[H3548]] and scribe, [[H5608]] and the Levites [[H3881]] who were instructing [[H995]] the people [[H5971]] said [[H559]] to all of them, [[H3605]] “This [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] is holy [[H6918]] to the LORD [[H3068]] your God. [[H430]] Do not [[H408]] mourn [[H56]] or weep.” [[H1058]] For [[H3588]] all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] were weeping [[H1058]] as they heard [[H8085]] the words [[H1697]] of the Law. [[H8451]]

###### 10
Then [Nehemiah] told [[H559]] them,  “Go [[H1980]] and eat [[H398]] what is rich, [[H4924]] drink [[H8354]] what is sweet, [[H4477]] and send out [[H7971]] portions [[H4490]] to those who have nothing [[H369]] prepared, [[H3559]] since [[H3588]] today [[H3117]] is holy [[H6918]] to our Lord. [[H136]] Do not [[H408]] grieve, [[H6087]] for [[H3588]] the joy [[H2304]] of the LORD [[H3068]] is [[H1931]] your strength. [[H4581]]

###### 11
And the Levites [[H3881]] calmed [[H2814]] all [[H3605]] the people, [[H5971]] saying, [[H559]] “Be still, [[H2013]] since [[H3588]] today [[H3117]] is holy. [[H6918]] Do not [[H408]] grieve.” [[H6087]]

###### 12
Then all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] began to eat [[H398]] and drink, [[H8354]] to send out [[H7971]] portions, [[H4490]] and [[H6213]] to rejoice [[H8057]] greatly, [[H1419]] because [[H3588]] they understood [[H995]] the words [[H1697]] that [[H834]] had been made known [[H3045]] to them. 

###### 13
On the second [[H8145]] day [of the month], [[H3117]] the heads [[H7218]] of all [[H3605]] the families, [[H1]] along with the priests [[H3548]] and Levites, [[H3881]] gathered [[H622]] around [[H413]] Ezra [[H5830]] the scribe [[H5608]] to study [[H7919]] the words [[H1697]] of the Law. [[H8451]]

###### 14
And they found [[H4672]] written [[H3789]] in the Law, [[H8451]] which [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] had commanded [[H6680]] through [[H3027]] Moses, [[H4872]] that [[H834]] the Israelites [[H1121]] were to dwell [[H3427]] in booths [[H5521]] during the feast [[H2282]] of the seventh [[H7637]] month. [[H2320]]

###### 15
So they proclaimed [[H8085]] this message [[H6963]] and spread [it] [[H5674]] throughout [[H3605]] their towns [[H5892]] and in Jerusalem, [[H3389]] saying, [[H559]] “Go out [[H3318]] to the hill country [[H2022]] and bring back [[H935]] branches [[H5929]] of olive, [[H2132]] wild olive, [[H8081]] myrtle, [[H1918]] palm, [[H8558]] and other leafy [[H5687]] trees, [[H6086]] to make [[H6213]] booths, [[H5521]] as it is written.” [[H3789]]

###### 16
And the people [[H5971]] went out, [[H3318]] brought back [branches], [[H935]] and made [[H6213]] booths [[H5521]] on [[H5921]] their own [[H376]] rooftops, [[H1406]] in their courtyards, [[H2691]] in the court [[H2691]] of the house [[H1004]] of God, [[H430]] and in the squares [[H7339]] by the Water [[H4325]] Gate [[H8179]] [and] [[H7339]] by the Gate [[H8179]] of Ephraim. [[H669]]

###### 17
The whole [[H3605]] assembly [[H6951]] who had returned [[H7725]] from [[H4480]] exile [[H7628]] made [[H6213]] booths [[H5521]] and lived [[H3427]] in them. [[H5521]] From the days [[H3117]] of Joshua [[H3442]] son [[H1121]] of Nun [[H5126]] until [[H5704]] that [[H1931]] day, [[H3117]] they [[H1121]] had not [[H3808]] celebrated [[H6213]] like this. [[H3651]] And there was great [[H1419]] rejoicing. [[H8057]]

###### 18
Day [[H3117]] after day, [[H3117]] from [[H4480]] the first [[H7223]] day [[H3117]] to [[H5704]] the last, [[H314]] Ezra read [[H7121]] from the Book [[H5612]] of the Law [[H8451]] of God. [[H430]] The Israelites kept [[H6213]] the feast [[H2282]] for seven [[H7651]] days, [[H3117]] and on the eighth [[H8066]] day [[H3117]] they held an assembly, [[H6116]] according to the ordinance.
