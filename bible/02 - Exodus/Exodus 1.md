###### 1
These [[H428]] are the names [[H8034]] of the sons [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] who went [[H935]] to Egypt [[H4714]] with [[H854]] Jacob, [[H3290]] each [[H376]] with his family: [[H1004]]

###### 2
Reuben, [[H7205]] Simeon, [[H8095]] Levi, [[H3878]] and Judah; [[H3063]]

###### 3
Issachar, [[H3485]] Zebulun, [[H2074]] and Benjamin; [[H1144]]

###### 4
Dan [[H1835]] and Naphtali, [[H5321]] Gad [[H1410]] and Asher. [[H836]]

###### 5
The descendants [[H5315]] of Jacob [[H3290]] numbered [[H1961]] seventy [[H7657]] in all, [[H3605]] including Joseph, [[H3130]] who was [[H1961]] already in Egypt. [[H4714]]

###### 6
Now Joseph [[H3130]] and all [[H3605]] his brothers [[H251]] and all [[H3605]] that [[H1931]] generation [[H1755]] died, [[H4191]]

###### 7
but the Israelites [[H1121]] were fruitful [[H6509]] and increased abundantly; [[H8317]] they multiplied [[H7235]] and became exceedingly [[H3966]] strong, [[H6105]] so that the land [[H776]] was filled with them. [[H4390]]

###### 8
Then a new [[H2319]] king, [[H4428]] who [[H834]] knew [[H3045]] nothing [[H3808]] of Joseph, [[H3130]] came to power [[H6965]] in [[H5921]] Egypt. [[H4714]]

###### 9
“Look,” [[H2009]] he said [[H559]] to [[H413]] his people, [[H5971]] “the Israelites [[H1121]] [have become] too numerous [[H7227]] and too powerful [[H6099]] for us. [[H4480]]

###### 10
Come, [[H3051]] we must deal shrewdly with them, [[H2449]] or [[H6435]] they will increase even more; [[H7235]] and if [[H1961]] a war [[H4421]] breaks out, [[H7122]] they [[H1931]] may join [[H3254]] our enemies, [[H8130]] fight against us, [[H3898]] and leave [[H5927]] the country.” [[H776]]

###### 11
So [the Egyptians] appointed [[H7760]] taskmasters [[H8269]] over [[H5921]] the Israelites to [[H4616]] oppress [[H6031]] them with forced labor. [[H5450]] As a result, they built [[H1129]] Pithom [[H6619]] and Rameses [[H7486]] as store [[H4543]] cities [[H5892]] for Pharaoh. [[H6547]]

###### 12
But the more they were oppressed, [[H6031]] the more they multiplied [[H7235]] and flourished, [[H6555]] so that the Egyptians came to dread [[H6973]] the Israelites. [[H1121]]

###### 13
They worked [[H5647]] the Israelites [[H1121]] ruthlessly [[H6531]]

###### 14
and made their lives [[H2416]] bitter [[H4843]] with hard [[H7186]] labor [[H5656]] in brick [[H3843]] and mortar, [[H2563]] and with all kinds [[H3605]] of work [[H5656]] in the fields. [[H7704]] Every [[H3605]] service [[H5656]] they imposed [[H5647]] was harsh. [[H6531]]

###### 15
Then the king [[H4428]] of Egypt [[H4714]] said [[H559]] to the Hebrew [[H5680]] midwives, [[H3205]] whose [[H834]] names were [[H8034]] Shiphrah [[H8236]] and [[H8145]] Puah, [[H6326]]

###### 16
“When you help the Hebrew [[H5680]] women give birth, [[H3205]] observe [[H7200]] them as [[H5921]] they deliver. [[H70]] If [[H518]] [the child] [[H1931]] is a son, [[H1121]] kill [[H4191]] him; [[H853]] but if [[H518]] it is [[H1931]] a daughter, [[H1323]] let her live.” [[H2425]]

###### 17
The midwives, however, [[H3205]] feared [[H3372]] God [[H430]] and did not [[H3808]] do [[H6213]] as [[H834]] the king [[H4428]] of Egypt [[H4714]] had told [[H1696]] them; [[H413]] they let the boys [[H3206]] live. [[H2421]]

###### 18
So the king [[H4428]] of Egypt [[H4714]] summoned [[H7121]] the midwives [[H3205]] and asked [[H559]] them,  “Why [[H4069]] have you done [[H6213]] this? [[H2088]] Why have you let the boys [[H3206]] live?” [[H2421]]

###### 19
The midwives [[H3205]] answered [[H559]] Pharaoh, [[H6547]] “The Hebrew women [[H5680]] are not [[H3808]] like the Egyptian [[H4713]] women, [[H802]] for [[H3588]] they [[H2007]] are vigorous [[H2422]] and give birth [[H3205]] before [[H2962]] a midwife [[H3205]] arrives.” [[H935]]

###### 20
So God [[H430]] was good [[H3190]] to the midwives, [[H3205]] and the people [[H5971]] multiplied [[H7235]] and became even more [[H3966]] numerous. [[H6105]]

###### 21
And because [[H3588]] the midwives [[H3205]] feared [[H3372]] God, [[H430]] He gave [[H6213]] them families of their own. [[H1004]]

###### 22
Then Pharaoh [[H6547]] commanded [[H6680]] all [[H3605]] his people: [[H5971]] “Every [[H3605]] son [[H1121]] born [to the Hebrews] [[H3209]] you must throw [[H7993]] into the Nile, [[H2975]] but every [[H3605]] daughter [[H1323]] you may allow to live.” [[H2421]]
