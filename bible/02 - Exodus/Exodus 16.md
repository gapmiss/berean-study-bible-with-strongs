### 1
On the fifteenth [[H2568]] day [[H3117]] of the second [[H8145]] month [[H2320]] after they had left [[H3318]] the land [[H776]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] the whole [[H3605]] congregation [[H5712]] of Israel [[H3478]] set out [[H5265]] from Elim [[H362]] and came [[H935]] to [[H413]] the Desert [[H4057]] of Sin, [[H5512]] which [[H834]] is between [[H996]] Elim [[H362]] and Sinai. [[H5514]]

### 2
And  [there] in the desert [[H4057]] [they all] [[H3605]] grumbled [[H3885]] against [[H5921]] Moses [[H4872]] and Aaron. [[H175]]

### 3
“If only [[H4310]] we had died [[H4191]] by the LORD’s [[H3068]] hand [[H3027]] in the land [[H776]] of Egypt!” [[H4714]] [they said]. [[H1121]] “There we sat [[H3427]] by [[H5921]] pots [[H5518]] of meat [[H1320]] and ate [[H398]] our fill [[H7648]] of bread, [[H3899]] but [[H3588]] you have brought [[H3318]] us into [[H413]] this [[H2088]] desert [[H4057]] to starve [[H7458]] this [[H2088]] whole [[H3605]] assembly [[H6951]] to death!” [[H4191]]

### 4
Then the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] “Behold, [[H2005]] I will rain down [[H4305]] bread [[H3899]] from [[H4480]] heaven [[H8064]] for you.  Each day [[H3117]] the people [[H5971]] are to go out [[H3318]] and gather [[H3950]] enough for that day. [[H1697]] In this way [[H4616]] I will test [[H5254]] whether [[H518]] or not [[H3808]] they will follow [[H1980]] My instructions. [[H8451]]

### 5
Then [[H1961]] on the sixth [[H8345]] day, [[H3117]] when they prepare [[H3559]] what [[H834]] they bring in, [[H935]] it will be [[H1961]] twice [[H4932]] as [[H5921]] much [[H834]] as they gather [[H3950]] on the other days.” [[H3117]]

### 6
So Moses [[H4872]] and Aaron [[H175]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] all [[H3605]] the Israelites, [[H1121]] “This evening [[H6153]] you will know [[H3045]] it was the LORD [[H3068]] who brought [[H3318]] you [[H853]] out of the land [[H776]] of Egypt, [[H4714]]

### 7
and in the morning [[H1242]] you will see [[H7200]] the LORD’s [[H3068]] glory, [[H3519]] because He has heard [[H8085]] your grumbling [[H8519]] against [[H5921]] Him. [[H3068]] For who [[H4100]] are we that [[H3588]] you should grumble [[H3885]] against us?” [[H5921]]

### 8
And Moses [[H4872]] added, [[H559]] “The LORD [[H3068]] will give [[H5414]] you meat [[H1320]] to eat [[H398]] this evening [[H6153]] and bread [[H3899]] to fill you [[H7646]] in the morning, [[H1242]] for He [[H3068]] has heard [[H8085]] your grumbling [[H8519]] against Him. [[H5921]] Who [[H4100]] are we? [[H5168]] Your grumblings [[H8519]] are not [[H3808]] against [[H5921]] us but [[H3588]] against [[H5921]] the LORD. [[H3068]]

### 9
Then Moses [[H4872]] said to [[H559]] Aaron, [[H175]] “Tell [[H559]] the whole [[H3605]] congregation [[H5712]] of Israel, [[H1121]] ‘Come [[H7126]] before [[H6440]] the LORD, [[H3068]] for [[H3588]] He has heard [[H8085]] your grumbling.’” [[H8519]]

### 10
And as soon [[H1961]] as Aaron [[H175]] spoke [[H1696]] to [[H413]] the whole [[H3605]] congregation [[H5712]] of Israel, [[H3478]] they looked [[H6437]] toward [[H413]] the desert, [[H4057]] and there [[H2009]] in a cloud [[H6051]] the glory [[H3519]] of the LORD [[H3068]] appeared. [[H7200]]

### 11
Then the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H1696]] to [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]]

### 12
“I have heard [[H8085]] the grumbling [[H8519]] of the Israelites. [[H1121]] Tell them, [[H1696]] ‘At [[H996]] twilight [[H6153]] you will eat [[H398]] meat, [[H1320]] and in the morning [[H1242]] you {will} be filled [[H7646]] with bread. [[H3899]] Then you will know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I [[H589]] am the LORD [[H3068]] your God.’” [[H430]]

### 13
That evening [[H6153]] quail [[H7958]] came [[H5927]] and covered [[H3680]] the camp, [[H4264]] and in the morning [[H1242]] there was [[H1961]] a layer [[H7902]] of dew [[H2919]] around [[H5439]] the camp. [[H4264]]

### 14
When the layer [[H7902]] of dew [[H2919]] had evaporated, [[H5927]] there [[H2009]] were thin [[H1851]] flakes [[H2636]] on [[H5921]] the desert [[H4057]] floor, [[H6440]] as fine [[H1851]] as frost [[H3713]] on [[H5921]] the ground. [[H776]]

### 15
When the Israelites [[H1121]] saw it, [[H7200]] they asked [[H559]] one [[H376]] another, [[H251]] “What [[H4478]] is it?” [[H1931]] For [[H3588]] they did not [[H3808]] know [[H3045]] what [[H4100]] it was. [[H1931]] So Moses [[H4872]] told them, [[H559]] “It [[H1931]] is the bread [[H3899]] the LORD [[H3068]] has given [[H5414]] you to eat. [[H402]]

### 16
This [[H2088]] is what [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] has commanded: [[H6680]] ‘Each one [[H376]] is to gather [[H3950]] as much [[H4480]] as [[H6310]] he needs. [[H400]] You may take [[H3947]] an omer [[H6016]] for each [[H1538]] person [[H5315]] in your tent.’” [[H168]]

### 17
So the Israelites [[H1121]] did [[H6213]] this. [[H3651]] Some gathered [[H3950]] more, [[H7235]] and some less. [[H4591]]

### 18
When they measured it [[H4058]] by the omer, [[H6016]] he who gathered much [[H7235]] had no [[H3808]] excess, [[H5736]] and he who gathered little [[H4591]] had no [[H3808]] shortfall. [[H2637]] Each one [[H376]] gathered [[H3950]] as [[H6310]] much as he needed to eat. [[H400]]

### 19
Then Moses [[H4872]] said [[H559]] to them, [[H413]] “No [[H408]] one [[H376]] may keep [[H3498]] any of it [[H4480]] until [[H5704]] morning.” [[H1242]]

### 20
But they did not [[H3808]] listen [[H8085]] to [[H413]] Moses; [[H4872]] some people [[H582]] left [[H3498]] part of [[H4480]] it until [[H5704]] morning, [[H1242]] and it became full of [[H7311]] maggots [[H8438]] and began to smell. [[H887]] So Moses [[H4872]] was angry [[H7107]] with them. [[H5921]]

### 21
Each morning [[H1242]] they each gathered [[H3950]] as much [[H6310]] as they needed, [[H400]] and when the sun [[H8121]] grew hot, [[H2552]] it melted away. [[H4549]]

### 22
On the sixth [[H8345]] day, [[H3117]] they gathered [[H3950]] twice [[H4932]] as much food— [[H3899]] two [[H8147]] omers [[H6016]] per person— [[H259]] and all [[H3605]] the leaders [[H5387]] of the congregation [[H5712]] came [[H935]] and reported [[H5046]] this to Moses. [[H4872]]

### 23
He told them, [[H559]] “This [[H1931]] is what [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] has said: [[H1696]] ‘Tomorrow [[H4279]] is a day of solemn rest, [[H7677]] a holy [[H6944]] Sabbath [[H7676]] to the LORD. [[H3068]] So [[H853]] bake [[H644]] what [[H834]] you want to bake, [[H644]] and [[H853]] boil [[H1310]] what [[H834]] you want to boil. [[H1310]] Then set aside [[H3240]] whatever [[H3605]] remains [[H5736]] and keep it [[H4931]] until [[H5704]] morning. [[H1242]]

### 24
So they set it aside [[H3240]] until [[H5704]] morning [[H1242]] as [[H834]] Moses [[H4872]] had commanded, [[H6680]] and it did not [[H3808]] smell [[H887]] [or] [[H3808]] contain [[H1961]] any maggots. [[H7415]]

### 25
“Eat it today,” [[H398]] Moses [[H4872]] said, [[H559]] “because [[H3588]] today [[H3117]] is a Sabbath [[H7676]] to the LORD. [[H3068]] Today [[H3117]] you will not [[H3808]] find anything [[H4672]] in the field. [[H7704]]

### 26
For six [[H8337]] days [[H3117]] you may gather, [[H3950]] but on the seventh [[H7637]] day, [[H3117]] the Sabbath, [[H7676]] it will not be [there].” [[H1961]]

### 27
Yet [[H1961]] on the seventh [[H7637]] day [[H3117]] some of [[H4480]] the people [[H5971]] went out [[H3318]] to gather, [[H3950]] but they did not [[H3808]] find anything. [[H4672]]

### 28
Then the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] “How long [[H5704]] will you refuse [[H3985]] to keep [[H8104]] My commandments [[H4687]] and instructions? [[H8451]]

### 29
Understand [[H7200]] that [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] has given [[H5414]] you the Sabbath; [[H7676]] therefore [[H5921]] on the sixth [[H8345]] day [[H3117]] He [[H1931]] will give [[H5414]] you  bread [[H3899]] for two days. [[H3117]] On the seventh [[H7637]] day, [[H3117]] everyone [[H376]] must stay [[H3427]] where he is; [[H8478]] no [[H408]] one [[H376]] may leave [[H3318]] his place. [[H4725]]

### 30
So the people [[H5971]] rested [[H7673]] on the seventh [[H7637]] day. [[H3117]]

### 31
Now the house [[H1004]] of Israel [[H3478]] called [[H7121]] the bread manna. [[H4478]] It [[H1931]] was white [[H3836]] like coriander [[H1407]] seed [[H2233]] and tasted [[H2940]] like wafers [[H6838]] made with honey. [[H1706]]

### 32
Moses [[H4872]] said, [[H559]] “This [[H2088]] is what [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] has commanded: [[H6680]] ‘Keep [[H4931]] an omer [[H6016]] of [manna] [[H4480]] for the generations to come, [[H1755]] so that [[H4616]] they may see [[H7200]] the bread [[H3899]] I fed [[H398]] you in the wilderness [[H4057]] when I brought you out [[H3318]] of the land [[H776]] of Egypt.’” [[H4714]]

### 33
So Moses [[H4872]] told [[H559]] Aaron, [[H175]] “Take [[H3947]] a [[H259]] jar [[H6803]] and fill it [[H5414]] with an omer [[H6016]] of manna. [[H4478]] Then place [[H3240]] it [[H853]] before [[H6440]] the LORD [[H3068]] to be preserved [[H4931]] for the generations to come.” [[H1755]]

### 34
So Aaron [[H175]] placed it [[H3240]] before [[H6440]] the Testimony [[H5715]] to be preserved, [[H4931]] just as [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] had commanded [[H6680]] Moses. [[H4872]]

### 35
The Israelites [[H1121]] ate [[H398]] manna [[H4478]] forty [[H705]] years, [[H8141]] until [[H5704]] they came [[H935]] to [[H413]] a land [[H776]] where they could settle; [[H3427]] they ate [[H398]] manna [[H4478]] until [[H5704]] they reached [[H935]] the border [[H7097]] of Canaan. [[H3667]]

### 36
(Now an omer [[H6016]] is a tenth [[H6224]] of an ephah.) [[H374]]
