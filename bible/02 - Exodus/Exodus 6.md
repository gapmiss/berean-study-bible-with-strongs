### 1
But the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] “Now [[H6258]] you will see [[H7200]] what [[H834]] I will do [[H6213]] to Pharaoh, [[H6547]] for [[H3588]] because of My mighty [[H2389]] hand [[H3027]] he will let them go; [[H7971]] because of My strong [[H2389]] hand [[H3027]] he will drive them out of [[H1644]] his land.” [[H776]]

### 2
God also [[H430]] told [[H1696]] Moses, [[H4872]] “I [[H589]] am the LORD. [[H3068]]

### 3
I appeared [[H7200]] to [[H413]] Abraham, [[H85]] to [[H413]] Isaac, [[H3327]] and to [[H413]] Jacob [[H3290]] as God [[H410]] Almighty, [[H7706]] but I did not [[H3808]] reveal Myself [[H3045]] to them  by My name, [[H8034]] ‘the LORD.’ [[H3068]]

### 4
I also [[H1571]] established [[H6965]] My covenant [[H1285]] with [[H854]] them to give [[H5414]] them the land [[H776]] of Canaan, [[H3667]] the land where [[H776]] they lived as foreigners. [[H1481]]

### 5
Furthermore, [[H1571]] I [[H589]] have heard [[H8085]] the groaning [[H5009]] of the Israelites, [[H1121]] whom [[H834]] the Egyptians [[H4714]] are enslaving, [[H5647]] and I have remembered [[H2142]] My covenant. [[H1285]]

### 6
Therefore [[H3651]] tell [[H559]] the Israelites: [[H1121]] ‘I [[H589]] am the LORD, [[H3068]] and I will bring [[H3318]] you [[H853]] out from under [[H8478]] the yoke [[H5450]] of the Egyptians [[H4714]] and deliver [[H5337]] you [[H853]] from their bondage. [[H5656]] I will redeem [[H1350]] you [[H853]] with an outstretched [[H5186]] arm [[H2220]] and with mighty [[H1419]] acts of judgment. [[H8201]]

### 7
I will take [[H3947]] you [[H853]] as My own  people, [[H5971]] and I will be [[H1961]] your  God. [[H430]] Then you will know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I [[H589]] am the LORD [[H3068]] your God, [[H430]] who brought [[H3318]] you [[H853]] out from under [[H8478]] the yoke [[H5450]] of the Egyptians. [[H4714]]

### 8
And I will bring [[H935]] you [[H853]] into [[H413]] the land [[H776]] that [[H834]] I swore [[H5375]] to give [[H5414]] to Abraham, [[H85]] Isaac, [[H3327]] and Jacob. [[H3290]] I will give [[H5414]] it [[H853]] to you  as a possession. [[H4181]] I [[H589]] am the LORD!’” [[H3068]]

### 9
Moses [[H4872]] relayed [[H1696]] this [message] [[H3651]] to [[H413]] the Israelites, [[H1121]] but on account of their broken spirit [[H7115]] and cruel [[H7186]] bondage, [[H5656]] they did not [[H3808]] listen [[H8085]] to [[H413]] [him]. [[H4872]]

### 10
So the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H1696]] to [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]]

### 11
“Go [[H935]] and tell [[H1696]] Pharaoh [[H6547]] king [[H4428]] of Egypt [[H4714]] to let the Israelites [[H1121]] go out [[H7971]] of his land.” [[H776]]

### 12
But in the LORD’s [[H3068]] presence [[H6440]] Moses [[H4872]] replied, [[H1696]] “If [[H2005]] the Israelites [[H1121]] will not [[H3808]] listen [[H8085]] to me, [[H413]] then how [[H349]] will Pharaoh [[H6547]] listen to me, [[H8085]] since I [[H589]] am unskilled [[H6189]] in speech?” [[H8193]]

### 13
Then the LORD [[H3068]] spoke [[H1696]] to [[H413]] Moses [[H4872]] and Aaron [[H175]] and gave them a charge [[H6680]] concerning [[H413]] both the Israelites [[H1121]] and Pharaoh [[H6547]] king [[H4428]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] to bring [[H3318]] the Israelites [[H1121]] out of the land [[H776]] of Egypt. [[H4714]]

### 14

### 20
And Amram [[H6019]] married [[H3947]] his father’s sister [[H1733]] Jochebed, [[H3115]] and she bore [[H3205]] him Aaron [[H175]] and Moses. [[H4872]] Amram [[H6019]] lived [[H2416]] 137 [[H7651]] years. [[H8141]]

### 22
The sons [[H1121]] of Uzziel [were] [[H5816]] Mishael, [[H4332]] Elzaphan, [[H469]] and Sithri. [[H5644]]

### 26
It was this [[H1931]] Aaron [[H175]] and Moses [[H4872]] to whom [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] said, [[H559]] “Bring the Israelites [[H1121]] out [[H3318]] of the land [[H776]] of Egypt [[H4714]] by [[H5921]] their divisions.” [[H6635]]

### 27
Moses [[H4872]] and Aaron [[H175]] were the ones who spoke [[H1696]] to [[H413]] Pharaoh [[H6547]] king [[H4428]] of Egypt [[H4714]] in order to bring the Israelites [[H1121]] out [[H3318]] of Egypt. [[H4714]]

### 28

### 29
He [[H3068]] said [[H1696]] to [[H413]] him, [[H4872]] “I [[H589]] am the LORD; [[H3068]] tell [[H1696]] Pharaoh [[H6547]] king [[H4428]] of Egypt [[H4714]] everything [[H3605]] that [[H834]] I [[H589]] say [[H1696]] to you.” [[H413]]

### 30
But in the LORD’s [[H3068]] presence [[H6440]] Moses [[H4872]] replied, [[H559]] “Since [[H2005]] I [[H589]] am unskilled [[H6189]] in speech, [[H8193]] why [[H349]] would Pharaoh [[H6547]] listen [[H8085]] to me?” [[H413]]
