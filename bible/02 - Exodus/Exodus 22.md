If [[H3588]] a man [[H376]] steals [[H1589]] an ox [[H7794]] or [[H176]] a sheep [[H7716]] and slaughters [[H2873]] or [[H176]] sells it, [[H4376]] he must repay [[H7999]] five [[H2568]] oxen [[H1241]] for [[H8478]] an ox [[H7794]] and four [[H702]] sheep [[H7716]] for a sheep. [[H6629]]

###### 2

###### 3
But if [[H518]] it happens after sunrise, [[H2224]] there is guilt for his bloodshed. [[H1818]] A thief must make full restitution; [[H7999]] if [[H518]] he has nothing, [[H369]] he himself shall be sold [[H4376]] for his theft. [[H1591]]

###### 4
If what was stolen [[H518]] is actually found [[H4672]] alive [[H2416]] in his possession— [[H3027]] whether ox [[H7794]] or [[H5704]] donkey [[H2543]] or [[H5704]] sheep— [[H7716]] he must pay back [[H7999]] double. [[H8147]]

###### 5
If [[H3588]] a man [[H376]] grazes his livestock [[H1197]] in a field [[H7704]] or [[H176]] vineyard [[H3754]] and allows them [[H1165]] to stray [[H7971]] so that they graze [[H1197]] in someone else’s [[H312]] field, [[H7704]] he must make restitution [[H7999]] from the best [[H4315]] of his own field [[H7704]] or vineyard. [[H3754]]

###### 6
If [[H3588]] a fire [[H784]] breaks out [[H3318]] and spreads [[H4672]] to thornbushes [[H6975]] so that it consumes [[H398]] stacked [[H1430]] or [[H176]] standing grain, [[H7054]] or [[H176]] the whole field, [[H7704]] the one who started [[H1197]] the fire [[H1200]] must make full restitution. [[H7999]]

###### 7
If [[H3588]] a man [[H376]] gives [[H5414]] his neighbor [[H7453]] money [[H3701]] or [[H176]] goods [[H3627]] for safekeeping [[H8104]] and they are stolen [[H1589]] from the neighbor’s [[H376]] house, [[H1004]] the thief, [[H1590]] if [[H518]] caught, [[H4672]] must pay back [[H7999]] double. [[H8147]]

###### 8
If [[H518]] the thief [[H1590]] is not [[H3808]] found, [[H4672]] the owner [[H1167]] of the house [[H1004]] must appear [[H7126]] before [[H413]] the judges [[H430]] to determine whether [[H518]] he has taken [[H7971]] his neighbor’s [[H7453]] property. [[H4399]]

###### 9
In [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] cases [[H1697]] of illegal possession [[H6588]] of [[H5921]] an ox, [[H7794]] a donkey, [[H2543]] a sheep, [[H7716]] a garment, [[H8008]] or any [[H3605]] lost item [[H9]] that [[H834]] someone claims, [[H559]] ‘This [[H2088]] is mine,’ [[H1931]] both parties [[H8147]] shall bring [[H935]] their cases [[H1697]] before [[H5704]] the judges. [[H430]] The one whom the judges [[H430]] condemn [[H7561]] must pay back [[H7999]] double [[H8147]] to his neighbor. [[H7453]]

###### 10
If [[H3588]] a man [[H376]] gives [[H5414]] a donkey, [[H2543]] an ox, [[H7794]] a sheep, [[H7716]] or any [[H3605]] other animal [[H929]] to be cared for [[H8104]] by his neighbor, [[H7453]] but it dies [[H4191]] or [[H176]] is injured [[H7665]] or [[H176]] stolen [[H7617]] while no [[H369]] one is watching, [[H7200]]

###### 11
an oath [[H7621]] before the LORD [[H3068]] shall be made [[H1961]] between [[H996]] the parties [[H8147]] to determine whether [[H518]] or not [[H3808]] the man has taken [[H7971]] his neighbor’s [[H7453]] property. [[H4399]] The owner [[H1167]] must accept [the oath] [[H3947]] and require no [[H3808]] restitution. [[H7999]]

###### 12
But if [[H518]] [the animal] was actually [[H1589]] stolen [[H1589]] from [the neighbor], [[H5973]] he must make restitution [[H7999]] to the owner. [[H1167]]

###### 13
If [[H518]] it was torn to pieces, [[H2963]] he shall bring [[H935]] it as evidence; [[H5707]] he need not [[H3808]] make restitution [[H7999]] for the torn carcass. [[H2966]]

###### 14
If [[H3588]] a man [[H376]] borrows [[H7592]] [an animal] [[H5973]] from his neighbor [[H7453]] and it is injured [[H7665]] or [[H176]] dies [[H4191]] while its owner [[H1167]] is not [[H369]] present, [[H5973]] he must make full restitution. [[H7999]]

###### 15
If [[H518]] the owner [[H1167]] was present, [[H5973]] no [[H3808]] restitution is required. [[H7999]] If [[H518]] [the animal] [[H1931]] was rented, [[H7916]] the fee covers the loss. [[H7939]]

###### 16
If [[H3588]] a man [[H376]] seduces [[H6601]] a virgin [[H1330]] who [[H834]] is not [[H3808]] pledged in marriage [[H781]] and sleeps [[H7901]] with her, [[H5973]] he must pay the full dowry [[H4117]] for her  to be his wife. [[H802]]

###### 17
If [[H518]] her father [[H1]] absolutely refuses [[H3985]] to give her [[H5414]] to him,  he still must pay [[H8254]] an amount comparable [[H3701]] to the bridal price [[H4119]] of a virgin. [[H1330]]

###### 18
You must not [[H3808]] allow a sorceress [[H3784]] to live. [[H2421]]

###### 19
Whoever [[H3605]] has sexual relations [[H7901]] with [[H5973]] an animal [[H929]] must surely be put to death. [[H4191]]

###### 20
Whoever sacrifices [[H2076]] to any god [[H430]] except [[H1115]] the LORD [[H3068]] alone [[H905]] must be utterly destroyed. [[H2763]]

###### 21
You must not [[H3808]] exploit [[H3238]] or [[H3808]] oppress [[H3905]] a foreign resident, [[H1616]] for [[H3588]] you [yourselves] were [[H1961]] foreigners [[H1616]] in the land [[H776]] of Egypt. [[H4714]]

###### 22
You must not [[H3808]] mistreat [[H6031]] any [[H3605]] widow [[H490]] or orphan. [[H3490]]

###### 23
If [[H518]] you do mistreat [[H6031]] them, [[H6031]] [and] they cry out [[H6817]] to Me [[H413]] in distress, [[H6817]] I will surely hear [[H8085]] their cry. [[H6818]]

###### 24
My anger [[H639]] will be kindled, [[H2734]] and I will kill [[H2026]] you with the sword; [[H2719]] then your wives [[H802]] will become [[H1961]] widows [[H490]] and your children [[H1121]] [will be] fatherless. [[H3490]]

###### 25
If [[H518]] you lend [[H3867]] money [[H3701]] to [one of] my people [[H5971]] among you [[H5973]] [who is] poor, [[H6041]] you must not [[H3808]] act [[H1961]] as a creditor [[H5383]] to him;  you are not to charge [[H7760]] him [[H5921]] any interest. [[H5392]]

###### 26
If [[H518]] you take your neighbor’s [[H7453]] cloak [[H8008]] as collateral, [[H2254]] return it [[H7725]] to him  by [[H5704]] sunset, [[H935]]

###### 27
because [[H3588]] [his cloak] [[H1931]] is the only [[H905]] covering [[H3682]] he has [[H1931]] [for] [[H8071]] his body. [[H5785]] What else [[H4100]] will he sleep in? [[H7901]] And if [[H3588]] he cries out [[H6817]] to Me, [[H413]] I will hear, [[H8085]] for [[H3588]] I [[H589]] am compassionate. [[H2587]]

###### 28
You must not [[H3808]] blaspheme [[H7043]] God [[H430]] or curse [[H779]] the ruler [[H5387]] of your people. [[H5971]]

###### 29
You must not [[H3808]] hold back [[H309]] [offerings] from your granaries [[H4395]] or vats. [[H1831]] You are to give [[H5414]] Me  the firstborn [[H1060]] of your sons. [[H1121]]

###### 30
You shall do [[H6213]] likewise [[H3651]] with your cattle [[H7794]] and your sheep. [[H6629]] Let them stay [[H1961]] with [[H5973]] their mothers [[H517]] for seven [[H7651]] days, [[H3117]] but on the eighth [[H8066]] day [[H3117]] you are to give them [[H5414]] to Me. 

###### 31
You are to be [[H1961]] My  holy [[H6944]] people. [[H376]] You must not [[H3808]] eat [[H398]] the meat [[H1320]] of a mauled animal [[H2966]] found in the field; [[H7704]] you are to throw [[H7993]] it [[H853]] to the dogs. [[H3611]]
