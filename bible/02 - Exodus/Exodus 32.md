### 1
Now when the people [[H5971]] saw [[H7200]] that [[H3588]] Moses [[H4872]] was delayed [[H954]] in coming down [[H3381]] from [[H4480]] the mountain, [[H2022]] they [[H5971]] gathered [[H6950]] around [[H5921]] Aaron [[H175]] and said, [[H559]] “Come, [[H6965]] make [[H6213]] us  gods [[H430]] who [[H834]] will go [[H1980]] before us. [[H6440]] As for [[H3588]] this [[H2088]] Moses [[H4872]] who [[H834]] brought us up [[H5927]] out of the land [[H776]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] we do not [[H3808]] know [[H3045]] what [[H4100]] has happened to him! [[H1961]]

### 2
So Aaron [[H175]] told [[H559]] them, [[H413]] “Take off [[H6561]] the gold [[H2091]] earrings [[H5141]] that [[H834]] are on [[H241]] your wives [[H802]] and sons [[H1121]] and daughters, [[H1323]] and bring [[H935]] them to me.” [[H413]]

### 3
Then all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] took off [[H6561]] their gold [[H2091]] earrings [[H5141]] and brought [[H935]] them to [[H413]] Aaron. [[H175]]

### 4
He took [the gold] [[H3947]] from their hands, [[H3027]] and [[H3335]] with an engraving tool [[H2747]] he fashioned [[H6213]] it [[H853]] into a molten [[H4541]] calf. [[H5695]] And they said, [[H559]] “O Israel, [[H3478]] these [[H428]] are your gods, [[H430]] who [[H834]] brought you up [[H5927]] out of the land [[H776]] of Egypt!” [[H4714]]

### 5
When Aaron [[H175]] saw this, [[H7200]] he built [[H1129]] an altar [[H4196]] before [the calf] [[H6440]] and proclaimed: [[H7121]] “Tomorrow [[H4279]] [shall be] a feast [[H2282]] to the LORD.” [[H3068]]

### 6
So the next day [[H4283]] they arose, [[H7925]] offered [[H5927]] burnt offerings, [[H5930]] and presented [[H5066]] peace offerings. [[H8002]] And the people [[H5971]] sat down [[H3427]] to eat [[H398]] and drink, [[H8354]] and got up [[H6965]] to indulge in revelry. [[H6711]]

### 7
Then the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H1696]] to [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] “Go down at once! [[H1980]] For [[H3588]] your people, [[H5971]] whom [[H834]] you brought up [[H5927]] out of the land [[H776]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] have corrupted themselves. [[H7843]]

### 8
How quickly they have [[H4118]] turned aside [[H5493]] from [[H4480]] the way [[H1870]] I commanded them. [[H6680]] They have made [[H6213]] for themselves  a molten [[H4541]] calf [[H5695]] and have bowed down to it, [[H7812]] sacrificed to it, [[H2076]] and said, [[H559]] ‘O Israel, [[H3478]] this [[H428]] is your God, [[H430]] who [[H834]] brought you up [[H5927]] out of the land [[H776]] of Egypt.’” [[H4714]]

### 9
The LORD [[H3068]] also said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] “I have seen [[H7200]] this [[H2088]] people, [[H5971]] and they [[H1931]] are indeed [[H2009]] a stiff-necked [[H7186]] people. [[H5971]]

### 10
Now [[H6258]] leave Me  alone, [[H3240]] so that My anger [[H639]] may burn [[H2734]] against them  and consume them. [[H3615]] Then I will make [[H6213]] you [[H853]] into a great [[H1419]] nation.” [[H1471]]

### 11
But Moses [[H4872]] entreated [[H2470]] the LORD [[H3068]] his God, [[H430]] saying, [[H559]] “O LORD, [[H3068]] why [[H4100]] does Your anger [[H639]] burn [[H2734]] against Your people, [[H5971]] whom [[H834]] You brought [[H3318]] out of the land [[H776]] of Egypt [[H4714]] with great [[H1419]] power [[H3581]] and a mighty [[H2389]] hand? [[H3027]]

### 12
Why [[H4100]] should the Egyptians declare, [[H559]] ‘He brought them out [[H3318]] with evil intent, [[H7451]] to kill [[H2026]] them in the mountains [[H2022]] and wipe [[H3615]] them from [[H5921]] the face [[H6440]] of the earth’? [[H127]] Turn [[H7725]] from Your fierce [[H2740]] anger [[H639]] and relent [[H5162]] from {doing} [[H5921]] harm [[H7451]] to Your people. [[H5971]]

### 13
Remember [[H2142]] Your servants [[H5650]] Abraham, [[H85]] Isaac, [[H3327]] and Israel, [[H3478]] to whom  You swore [[H7650]] by Your very self  when You declared, [[H1696]] ‘{I will make} your descendants [[H2233]] as numerous [[H7235]] as the stars [[H3556]] in the sky, [[H8064]] and I will give [[H5414]] your descendants [[H2233]] all [[H3605]] this [[H2063]] land [[H776]] that [[H834]] I have promised, [[H559]] and it shall be their inheritance [[H5157]] forever. [[H5769]]

### 14
So the LORD [[H3068]] relented [[H5162]] from [[H5921]] the calamity [[H7451]] He had threatened [[H1696]] to bring [[H6213]] on His people. [[H5971]]

### 15
Then Moses [[H4872]] turned [[H6437]] and went down [[H3381]] the mountain [[H2022]] with the two [[H8147]] tablets [[H3871]] of the Testimony [[H5715]] in his hands. [[H3027]] They [[H1992]] were inscribed [[H3789]] on [[H4480]] both [[H8147]] sides, [[H5676]] front [[H2088]] and back. [[H2088]]

### 16
The tablets [[H3871]] were the work [[H4639]] of God, [[H430]] and the writing [[H4385]] [was] the writing [[H4385]] of God, [[H430]] engraved [[H2801]] on [[H5921]] the tablets. [[H3871]]

### 17
When Joshua [[H3091]] heard [[H8085]] the sound [[H6963]] of the people [[H5971]] shouting, [[H7452]] he said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] “The sound [[H6963]] of war [[H4421]] [is] in the camp.” [[H4264]]

### 18
But Moses replied: [[H559]] “It is neither [[H369]] the cry [[H6963]] of victory [[H1369]] nor [[H369]] the cry [[H6963]] of defeat; [[H2476]] I [[H595]] hear [[H8085]] the sound [[H6963]] of singing!” [[H6030]]

### 19
As [[H834]] [Moses] approached [[H7126]] the camp [[H4264]] and saw [[H7200]] the calf [[H5695]] and the dancing, [[H4246]] he [[H4872]] burned [[H2734]] with anger [[H639]] and threw [[H7993]] the tablets [[H3871]] out of  his hands, [[H3027]] smashing [[H7665]] them at the base of [[H8478]] the mountain. [[H2022]]

### 20
Then he took [[H3947]] the calf [[H5695]] they had made, [[H6213]] burned it [[H8313]] in the fire, [[H784]] ground [it] [[H2912]] to [[H5704]] powder, [[H1854]] and scattered [the powder] [[H2219]] over [[H5921]] the face [[H6440]] of the water. [[H4325]] Then he forced [[H1121]] the Israelites [[H3478]] to drink [[H8248]] it. [[H853]]

### 21
“What [[H4100]] did this [[H2088]] people [[H5971]] do [[H6213]] to you,”  Moses [[H4872]] asked [[H559]] Aaron, [[H175]] “that [[H3588]] you have led [[H935]] them into [[H5921]] so great [[H1419]] a sin?” [[H2401]]

### 22
“Do not [[H408]] be enraged, [[H2734]] my lord,” [[H113]] Aaron [[H175]] replied. [[H559]] “You [[H859]] yourself know [[H3045]] that the people [[H5971]] are intent on evil. [[H7451]]

### 23
They told [[H559]] me,  ‘Make [[H6213]] us  gods [[H430]] who [[H834]] will go [[H1980]] before us. [[H6440]] As for [[H3588]] this [[H2088]] Moses [[H4872]] who [[H834]] brought us up [[H5927]] out of the land [[H776]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] we do not [[H3808]] know [[H3045]] what [[H4100]] has happened [[H1961]] to him!’ 

### 24
So I said [[H559]] to them,  ‘Whoever [[H4310]] has gold, [[H2091]] let him take it off,’ [[H6561]] and they gave it [[H5414]] to me.  And when I cast it [[H7993]] into the fire, [[H784]] out came [[H3318]] this [[H2088]] calf!” [[H5695]]

### 25
Moses [[H4872]] saw [[H7200]] that the people [[H5971]] were out of control, [[H6544]] for [[H3588]] Aaron [[H175]] had let them run wild [[H6544]] and become a laughingstock [[H8103]] to their enemies. [[H6965]]

### 26
So Moses [[H4872]] stood [[H5975]] at the entrance [[H8179]] of the camp [[H4264]] and said, [[H559]] “Whoever [[H4310]] is for the LORD, [[H3068]] come to me.” [[H413]] And all [[H3605]] the Levites [[H1121]] gathered [[H622]] around him. [[H413]]

### 27
He told [[H559]] them,  “This is what [[H3541]] the LORD, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] says: [[H559]] ‘Each of you men [[H376]] is to fasten [[H7760]] his sword [[H2719]] to [[H5921]] his side, [[H3409]] go back and forth [[H5674]] through the camp [[H4264]] from gate [[H8179]] to gate, [[H8179]] and slay [[H2026]] his brother, [[H251]] his friend, [[H7453]] and his neighbor.’” [[H7138]]

### 28
The Levites [[H1121]] did [[H6213]] as Moses [[H4872]] commanded, [[H1697]] and that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] about three [[H7969]] thousand [[H505]] of [[H4480]] the people [[H5971]] fell dead. [[H5307]]

### 29
Afterward, Moses [[H4872]] said, [[H559]] “Today [[H3117]] you have been ordained [[H4390]] for service [[H3027]] to the LORD, [[H3068]] since [[H3588]] each man [[H376]] went against his son [[H1121]] and his brother; [[H251]] so He has bestowed [[H5414]] a blessing [[H1293]] on you [[H5921]] this day.” [[H3117]]

### 30
The next day [[H4283]] Moses [[H4872]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] the people, [[H5971]] “You [[H859]] have committed [[H2398]] a great [[H1419]] sin. [[H2401]] Now [[H6258]] I will go up [[H5927]] to [[H413]] the LORD; [[H3068]] perhaps [[H194]] I can make atonement [[H3722]] for [[H1157]] your sin.” [[H2403]]

### 31
So Moses [[H4872]] returned [[H7725]] to [[H413]] the LORD [[H3068]] and said, [[H559]] “Oh, [[H577]] what a great [[H1419]] sin [[H2401]] these [[H2088]] people [[H5971]] have committed; [[H2398]] they have made [[H6213]] gods [[H430]] of gold [[H2091]] for themselves. 

### 32
Yet now, [[H6258]] if [[H518]] You would only forgive [[H5375]] their sin... [[H2403]] But if [[H518]] not, [[H369]] please [[H4994]] blot me [[H4229]] out of the book [[H5612]] that [[H834]] You have written.” [[H3789]]

### 33
The LORD [[H3068]] replied [[H559]] to [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] “Whoever [[H4310]] has sinned [[H2398]] against Me,  I will erase [[H4229]] from My book. [[H5612]]

### 34
Now [[H6258]] go, [[H1980]] lead [[H5148]] the people [[H5971]] to [[H413]] the place I told [[H1696]] you.  Behold, [[H2009]] My angel [[H4397]] shall go [[H1980]] before you. [[H6440]] But on the day [[H3117]] I settle accounts, [[H6485]] I will punish them [[H6485]] for their sin.” [[H2403]]

### 35
And the LORD [[H3068]] sent a plague [[H5062]] on the people [[H5971]] because of [[H5921]] what [[H834]] they had done [[H6213]] with the calf [[H5695]] that [[H834]] Aaron [[H175]] had made. [[H6213]]
