###### 1
Then the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H1696]] to [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]]

###### 2
“On the first [[H259]] day [[H3117]] of the first [[H7223]] month [[H2320]] you are to set up [[H6965]] the tabernacle, [[H4908]] the Tent [[H168]] of Meeting. [[H4150]]

###### 3
Put [[H7760]] the Ark [[H727]] of the Testimony [[H5715]] in it [[H8033]] and screen [[H5526]] off [[H5921]] the ark [[H727]] with the veil. [[H6532]]

###### 4
Then bring in [[H935]] the table [[H7979]] and set out [[H6186]] its arrangement; [[H6187]] bring in [[H935]] the lampstand {as well}, [[H4501]] and set up [[H5927]] its lamps. [[H5216]]

###### 5
Place [[H5414]] the gold [[H2091]] altar [[H4196]] of incense [[H7004]] in front [[H6440]] of the Ark [[H727]] of the Testimony, [[H5715]] and hang [[H7760]] the curtain [[H4539]] at the entrance [[H6607]] to the tabernacle. [[H4908]]

###### 6
Place [[H5414]] the altar [[H4196]] of burnt offering [[H5930]] in front [[H6440]] of the entrance [[H6607]] to the tabernacle, [[H4908]] the Tent [[H168]] of Meeting. [[H4150]]

###### 7
And place [[H5414]] the basin [[H3595]] between [[H996]] the Tent [[H168]] of Meeting [[H4150]] and the altar, [[H4196]] and put [[H5414]] water in it. [[H4325]]

###### 8
Set up [[H7760]] the surrounding [[H5439]] courtyard [[H2691]] and hang [[H5414]] the curtain [[H4539]] for the entrance [[H8179]] of the courtyard. [[H2691]]

###### 9
Take [[H3947]] the anointing [[H4888]] oil [[H8081]] and anoint [[H4886]] the tabernacle [[H4908]] and everything in it; [[H3605]] consecrate [[H6942]] it along with all [[H3605]] its furnishings, [[H3627]] and it shall be [[H1961]] holy. [[H6944]]

###### 10
Anoint [[H4886]] the altar [[H4196]] of burnt offering [[H5930]] and all [[H3605]] its utensils; [[H3627]] consecrate [[H6942]] the altar [[H4196]] and it shall be [[H1961]] most [[H6944]] holy. [[H6944]]

###### 11
Anoint [[H4886]] the basin [[H3595]] and its stand [[H3653]] and consecrate them. [[H6942]]

###### 12
Then bring [[H7126]] Aaron [[H175]] and his sons [[H1121]] to [[H413]] the entrance [[H6607]] of the Tent [[H168]] of Meeting [[H4150]] and wash [[H7364]] them with water. [[H4325]]

###### 13
And you are to clothe [[H3847]] Aaron [[H175]] with the holy [[H6944]] garments, [[H899]] anoint him, [[H4886]] and consecrate him, [[H6942]] so that he may serve Me as a priest. [[H3547]]

###### 14
Bring his sons [[H1121]] forward [[H7126]] and clothe [[H3847]] them [[H853]] with tunics. [[H3801]]

###### 15
Anoint [[H4886]] them [[H853]] just as [[H834]] you anointed [[H4886]] their father, [[H1]] so that they may also serve Me as priests. [[H3547]] Their anointing [[H4888]] will qualify [[H1961]] them for a perpetual [[H5769]] priesthood [[H3550]] throughout their generations.” [[H1755]]

###### 16
Moses [[H4872]] did [[H6213]] everything [[H3605]] just as [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] had commanded him. [[H6680]]

###### 17
So [[H1961]] the tabernacle [[H4908]] was set up [[H6965]] on the first [[H259]] day [[H2320]] of the first [[H7223]] month [[H2320]] of the second [[H8145]] year. [[H8141]]

###### 18
When Moses [[H4872]] set up [[H6965]] the tabernacle, [[H4908]] he laid [[H5414]] its bases, [[H134]] positioned [[H7760]] its frames, [[H7175]] inserted [[H5414]] its crossbars, [[H1280]] and set up [[H6965]] its posts. [[H5982]]

###### 19
Then he spread [[H6566]] the tent [[H168]] over [[H5921]] the tabernacle [[H4908]] and put [[H7760]] the covering [[H4372]] over the tent, [[H168]] just as [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] had commanded [[H6680]] [him]. [[H4872]]

###### 20
Moses took [[H3947]] the Testimony [[H5715]] and placed [[H5414]] it in [[H413]] the ark, [[H727]] attaching [[H7760]] the poles [[H905]] to [[H5921]] the ark; [[H727]] and he set [[H5414]] the mercy seat [[H3727]] atop [[H5921]] the ark. [[H727]]

###### 21
Then he brought [[H935]] the ark [[H727]] into [[H413]] the tabernacle, [[H4908]] put up [[H7760]] the veil [[H6532]] for the screen, [[H4539]] and shielded [[H5526]] off [[H5921]] the Ark [[H727]] of the Testimony, [[H5715]] just as [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] had commanded [[H6680]] him. [[H4872]]

###### 22
Moses placed [[H5414]] the table [[H7979]] in the Tent [[H168]] of Meeting [[H4150]] on [[H5921]] the north [[H6828]] side [[H3409]] of the tabernacle, [[H4908]] outside [[H2351]] the veil. [[H6532]]

###### 23
He arranged [[H6186]] the bread [[H3899]] on it [[H5921]] before [[H6440]] the LORD, [[H3068]] just as [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] had commanded [[H6680]] him. [[H4872]]

###### 24
He also placed [[H7760]] the lampstand [[H4501]] in the Tent [[H168]] of Meeting [[H4150]] opposite [[H5227]] the table [[H7979]] on [[H5921]] the south [[H5045]] side [[H3409]] of the tabernacle [[H4908]]

###### 25
and set up [[H5927]] the lamps [[H5216]] before [[H6440]] the LORD, [[H3068]] just as [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] had commanded [[H6680]] him. [[H4872]]

###### 26
Moses placed [[H7760]] the gold [[H2091]] altar [[H4196]] in the Tent [[H168]] of Meeting, [[H4150]] in front [[H6440]] of the veil, [[H6532]]

###### 27
and he burned [[H6999]] fragrant [[H5561]] incense [[H7004]] on it, [[H5921]] just as [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] had commanded [[H6680]] him. [[H4872]]

###### 28
Then he put up [[H7760]] the curtain [[H4539]] at the entrance [[H6607]] to the tabernacle. [[H4908]]

###### 29
He placed [[H7760]] the altar [[H4196]] of burnt offering [[H5930]] near the entrance [[H6607]] to the tabernacle, [[H4908]] the Tent [[H168]] of Meeting, [[H4150]] and offered [[H5927]] on it [[H5921]] the burnt offering [[H5930]] and the grain offering, [[H4503]] just as [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] had commanded [[H6680]] him. [[H4872]]

###### 30
He placed [[H7760]] the basin [[H3595]] between [[H996]] the Tent [[H168]] of Meeting [[H4150]] and the altar [[H4196]] and put [[H5414]] water [[H4325]] in it [[H8033]] for washing; [[H7364]]

###### 31
and from it [[H4480]] Moses, [[H4872]] Aaron, [[H175]] and his sons [[H1121]] washed [[H7364]] their hands [[H3027]] and feet. [[H7272]]

###### 32
They washed [[H7364]] whenever they entered [[H935]] the Tent [[H168]] of Meeting [[H4150]] or approached [[H7126]] the altar, [[H4196]] just as [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] had commanded [[H6680]] Moses. [[H4872]]

###### 33
Then Moses set up [[H6965]] the courtyard [[H2691]] around [[H5439]] the tabernacle [[H4908]] and the altar, [[H4196]] and he hung [[H5414]] the curtain [[H4539]] for the entrance [[H8179]] of the courtyard. [[H2691]] So Moses [[H4872]] finished [[H3615]] the work. [[H4399]]

###### 34
Then the cloud [[H6051]] covered [[H3680]] the Tent [[H168]] of Meeting, [[H4150]] and the glory [[H3519]] of the LORD [[H3068]] filled [[H4390]] the tabernacle. [[H4908]]

###### 35
Moses [[H4872]] was unable [[H3808]] to enter [[H935]] the Tent [[H168]] of Meeting [[H4150]] because [[H3588]] the cloud [[H6051]] had settled [[H7931]] on it, [[H5921]] and the glory [[H3519]] of the LORD [[H3068]] filled [[H4390]] the tabernacle. [[H4908]]

###### 36
Whenever the cloud [[H6051]] was lifted [[H5927]] from [[H5921]] above the tabernacle, [[H4908]] the Israelites [[H1121]] would set out [[H5265]] through all [[H3605]] the stages of their journey. [[H4550]]

###### 37
If [[H518]] the cloud [[H6051]] was not [[H3808]] lifted, [[H5927]] they would not [[H3808]] set out [[H5265]] until [[H5704]] the day [[H3117]] it was taken up. [[H5927]]

###### 38
For [[H3588]] the cloud [[H6051]] of the LORD [[H3068]] was over [[H5921]] the tabernacle [[H4908]] by day, [[H3119]] and fire [[H784]] was [[H1961]] in the cloud  by night, [[H3915]] in the sight [[H5869]] of all [[H3605]] the house [[H1004]] of Israel [[H3478]] through all [[H3605]] their journeys.
