###### 1
Then the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] “Chisel out [[H6458]] two [[H8147]] stone [[H68]] tablets [[H3871]] like the original ones, [[H7223]] and I will write [[H3789]] on [[H5921]] them [[H3871]] the words [[H1697]] that [[H834]] were [[H1961]] on [[H5921]] the first [[H7223]] tablets, [[H3871]] which [[H834]] you broke. [[H7665]]

###### 2
Be [[H1961]] ready [[H3559]] in the morning, [[H1242]] and come up [[H5927]] on Mount [[H2022]] Sinai [[H5514]] to present yourself [[H5324]] before Me  on [[H5921]] the mountaintop. [[H7218]]

###### 3
No [[H3808]] one [[H376]] may go up [[H5927]] with you; [[H5973]] in fact, [[H1571]] no [[H408]] one [[H376]] may be seen [[H7200]] anywhere [[H3605]] on the mountain— [[H2022]] not [[H408]] even [[H1571]] the flocks [[H6629]] or herds [[H1241]] may graze [[H7462]] in front of [[H413]] the [[H1931]] mountain.” [[H2022]]

###### 4
So Moses [[H4872]] chiseled [[H6458]] two [[H8147]] stone [[H68]] tablets [[H3871]] like the originals. [[H7223]] He rose early [[H7925]] in the morning, [[H1242]] and taking [[H3947]] the two [[H8147]] stone [[H68]] tablets [[H3871]] in his hand, [[H3027]] he ascended [[H5927]] Mount [[H2022]] Sinai [[H5514]] as [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] had commanded him. [[H6680]]

###### 5
And the LORD [[H3068]] descended [[H3381]] in a cloud, [[H6051]] stood [[H3320]] with [[H5973]] him there, [[H8033]] and proclaimed [[H7121]] His name, [[H8034]] the LORD. [[H3068]]

###### 6
Then the LORD [[H3068]] passed [[H5674]] in front of [[H5921]] [Moses] [[H6440]] and called out: [[H7121]] “The LORD, [[H3068]] the LORD [[H3068]] God, [[H410]] is compassionate [[H7349]] and gracious, [[H2587]] slow [[H750]] to anger, [[H639]] abounding [[H7227]] in loving devotion [[H2617]] and truth, [[H571]]

###### 7
maintaining [[H5341]] loving devotion [[H2617]] to a thousand [generations], [[H505]] forgiving [[H5375]] iniquity, [[H5771]] transgression, [[H6588]] and sin. [[H2403]] Yet He will by no [[H3808]] means [[H5352]] excuse [the guilty]; [[H5352]] He will visit [[H6485]] the iniquity [[H5771]] of the fathers [[H1]] on [[H5921]] their children [[H1121]] and grandchildren [[H1121]] to [[H5921]] the third [[H8029]] and fourth generations.” [[H7256]]

###### 8
Moses [[H4872]] immediately [[H4116]] bowed down [[H6915]] to the ground [[H776]] and worshiped. [[H7812]]

###### 9
“O Lord,” [[H136]] he said, [[H559]] “if [[H518]] I have indeed found [[H4672]] favor [[H2580]] in Your sight, [[H5869]] my Lord, [[H136]] please [[H4994]] go [[H1980]] with us. [[H7130]] Although [[H3588]] this [[H1931]] is a stiff-necked [[H7186]] people, [[H5971]] forgive [[H5545]] our iniquity [[H5771]] and sin, [[H2403]] and take us as Your inheritance.” [[H5157]]

###### 10
And the LORD said, [[H559]] “Behold, [[H2009]] I [[H595]] am making [[H3772]] a covenant. [[H1285]] Before [[H5048]] all [[H3605]] your people [[H5971]] I will perform [[H6213]] wonders [[H6381]] that [[H834]] have never [[H3808]] been done [[H1254]] in any [[H3605]] nation [[H1471]] in all [[H3605]] the world. [[H776]] All [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] among whom you live [[H7130]] will see [[H7200]] the LORDs [[H3068]] work, [[H4639]] for [[H3588]] it [is] [[H1931]] an awesome [thing] [[H3372]] that [[H834]] I [[H589]] am doing [[H6213]] with you. [[H5973]]

###### 11
Observe [[H8104]] what [[H834]] I [[H595]] command you [[H6680]] this day. [[H3117]] I will drive out [[H1644]] before you [[H6440]] the Amorites, [[H567]] Canaanites, [[H3669]] Hittites, [[H2850]] Perizzites, [[H6522]] Hivites, [[H2340]] and Jebusites. [[H2983]]

###### 12
Be careful [[H8104]] not [[H6435]] to make [[H3772]] a treaty [[H1285]] with the inhabitants [[H3427]] of the land [[H776]] you [[H859]] are entering, [[H935]] lest [[H6435]] they become [[H1961]] a snare [[H4170]] in your midst. [[H7130]]

###### 13
Rather, [[H3588]] you must tear down [[H5422]] their altars, [[H4196]] smash [[H7665]] their sacred stones, [[H4676]] and chop down [[H3772]] their Asherah poles. [[H842]]

###### 14
For [[H3588]] you must not [[H3808]] worship [[H7812]] any other [[H312]] god, [[H410]] for [[H3588]] the LORD, [[H3068]] whose name [is] [[H8034]] Jealous, [[H7067]] [is] a jealous [[H7067]] God. [[H410]]

###### 15
Do not [[H6435]] make [[H3772]] a covenant [[H1285]] with the inhabitants [[H3427]] of the land, [[H776]] for when they prostitute themselves [[H2181]] to [[H310]] their gods [[H430]] and sacrifice [[H2076]] to [them], [[H430]] they will invite [[H7121]] you,  and you will eat [[H398]] their sacrifices; [[H2077]]

###### 16
and when you take [[H3947]] some of their daughters [[H1323]] as brides for your sons, [[H1121]] their daughters [[H1323]] will prostitute themselves [[H2181]] to [[H310]] their gods [[H430]] and cause your sons [[H1121]] [to do the same]. [[H2181]]

###### 17
You shall make [[H6213]] no [[H3808]] molten [[H4541]] gods [[H430]] for yourselves. 

###### 18
You are to observe [[H8104]] the Feast [[H2282]] of Unleavened Bread. [[H4682]] For seven [[H7651]] days [[H3117]] at the appointed time [[H4150]] in the month [[H2320]] of Abib, [[H24]] you are to eat [[H398]] unleavened bread [[H4682]] as [[H834]] I commanded you. [[H6680]] For [[H3588]] in the month [[H2320]] of Abib [[H24]] you came out [[H3318]] of Egypt. [[H4714]]

###### 19
The first offspring [[H6363]] of every [[H3605]] womb [[H7358]] belongs to Me,  including all [[H3605]] the firstborn [[H6363]] males [[H2142]] among your livestock, [[H4735]] [whether] cattle [[H7794]] or sheep. [[H7716]]

###### 20
You must redeem [[H6299]] the firstborn [[H6363]] of a donkey [[H2543]] with a lamb; [[H7716]] but if [[H518]] you do not [[H3808]] redeem it, [[H6299]] break its neck. [[H6202]] You must redeem [[H6299]] all [[H3605]] the firstborn [[H1060]] of your sons. [[H1121]] No [[H3808]] one shall appear [[H7200]] before Me [[H6440]] empty-handed. [[H7387]]

###### 21
Six [[H8337]] days [[H3117]] you shall labor, [[H5647]] but on the seventh [[H7637]] day [[H3117]] you shall rest; [[H7673]] even in plowing [[H2758]] and harvesting seasons, [[H7105]] you must rest. [[H7673]]

###### 22
And you  are to celebrate [[H6213]] the Feast [[H2282]] of Weeks [[H7620]] with the firstfruits [[H1061]] of the wheat [[H2406]] harvest, [[H7105]] and the Feast [[H2282]] of Ingathering [[H614]] at the turn [[H8622]] of the year. [[H8141]]

###### 23
Three [[H7969]] times [[H6471]] a year [[H8141]] all [[H3605]] your males [[H2138]] are to appear [[H7200]] before [[H6440]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

###### 24
For [[H3588]] I will drive out [[H3423]] the nations [[H1471]] before you [[H6440]] and enlarge [[H7337]] your borders, [[H1366]] and no [[H3808]] one [[H376]] will covet [[H2530]] your land [[H776]] when you go up [[H5927]] three [[H7969]] times [[H6471]] a year [[H8141]] to appear [[H7200]] before [[H6440]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God. [[H430]]

###### 25
Do not [[H3808]] offer [[H7819]] the blood [[H1818]] of My sacrifice [[H2077]] along with [[H5921]] anything leavened, [[H2557]] and do not let [[H3808]] any of the sacrifice [[H2077]] from the Passover [[H6453]] Feast [[H2282]] remain [[H3885]] until morning. [[H1242]]

###### 26
Bring [[H935]] the best [[H7225]] of the firstfruits [[H1061]] of your soil [[H127]] to the house [[H1004]] of the LORD [[H3068]] your God. [[H430]] You shall not [[H3808]] cook [[H1310]] a young goat [[H1423]] in its mother’s [[H517]] milk.” [[H2461]]

###### 27
The LORD [[H3068]] also said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] “Write down [[H3789]] these [[H428]] words, [[H1697]] for [[H3588]] in accordance with [[H5921]] these [[H428]] words [[H1697]] I have made [[H3772]] a covenant [[H1285]] with [[H854]] you and with [[H854]] Israel.” [[H3478]]

###### 28
So Moses was [[H1961]] there [[H8033]] with [[H5973]] the LORD [[H3068]] forty [[H705]] days [[H3117]] and forty [[H705]] nights [[H3915]] without [[H3808]] eating [[H398]] bread [[H3899]] or drinking [[H8354]] water. [[H4325]] [He wrote] on [[H5921]] the tablets [[H3871]] the words [[H1697]] of the covenant— [[H1285]] the Ten [[H6235]] Commandments. [[H1697]]

###### 29
And [[H1961]] when Moses [[H4872]] came down [[H3381]] from [[H4480]] Mount [[H2022]] Sinai [[H5514]] with the two [[H8147]] tablets [[H3871]] of the Testimony [[H5715]] in his [[H4872]] hands, [[H3027]] he [[H4872]] was unaware [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] his face [[H6440]] had become radiant [[H7160]] from speaking [[H1696]] with the LORD. [[H854]]

###### 30
Aaron [[H175]] and all [[H3605]] the Israelites [[H1121]] looked at [[H7200]] Moses, [[H4872]] and behold, [[H2009]] his face [[H6440]] was radiant. [[H7160]] And they were afraid [[H3372]] to approach [[H5066]] him. [[H413]]

###### 31
But Moses [[H4872]] called out [[H7121]] to them; [[H413]] so Aaron [[H175]] and all [[H3605]] the leaders [[H5387]] of the congregation [[H5712]] returned [[H7725]] to him, [[H413]] and Moses [[H4872]] spoke [[H1696]] to them. [[H413]]

###### 32
And after [[H310]] this [[H3651]] all [[H3605]] the Israelites [[H1121]] came near, [[H5066]] and [Moses] commanded [[H6680]] them to do everything [[H3605]] that [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] had told him [[H1696]] on Mount [[H2022]] Sinai. [[H5514]]

###### 33
When Moses [[H4872]] had finished [[H3615]] speaking [[H1696]] to them, [[H854]] he put [[H5414]] a veil [[H4533]] over [[H5921]] his face. [[H6440]]

###### 34
But whenever Moses [[H4872]] went in [[H935]] before [[H6440]] the LORD [[H3068]] to speak [[H1696]] with Him, [[H854]] he would remove [[H5493]] the veil [[H4533]] until [[H5704]] he came out. [[H3318]] And when he came out, [[H3318]] he would tell [[H1696]] the Israelites [[H1121]] what [[H834]] he had been commanded, [[H6680]]

###### 35
and the Israelites [[H1121]] would see [[H7200]] that [[H3588]] the face [[H6440]] of Moses [[H4872]] was radiant. [[H7160]] So Moses [[H4872]] would put the veil [[H4533]] back [[H7725]] over [[H5921]] his face [[H6440]] until [[H5704]] he went in [[H935]] to speak [[H1696]] with the LORD. [[H854]]
