### 1
Meanwhile, Moses [[H4872]] was [[H1961]] shepherding [[H7462]] the flock [[H6629]] of his father-in-law [[H2859]] Jethro, [[H3503]] the priest [[H3548]] of Midian. [[H4080]] He led [[H5090]] the flock [[H6629]] to the far side [[H310]] of the wilderness [[H4057]] and came [[H935]] to [[H413]] Horeb, [[H2722]] the mountain [[H2022]] of God. [[H430]]

### 2
There the Angel [[H4397]] of the LORD [[H3068]] appeared [[H7200]] to [[H413]] him in a blazing [[H3827]] fire [[H784]] from within [[H8432]] a bush. [[H5572]] Moses saw [[H7200]] the bush [[H5572]] ablaze [[H1197]] with fire, [[H784]] but it was not [[H369]] consumed! [[H398]]

### 3
So Moses [[H4872]] thought, [[H559]] “I must go over [[H5493]] and see [[H7200]] this [[H2088]] marvelous [[H1419]] sight. [[H4758]] Why is [[H4069]] the bush [[H5572]] not [[H3808]] burning up?” [[H1197]]

### 4
When the LORD [[H3068]] saw [[H7200]] that [[H3588]] he had gone over [[H5493]] to look, [[H7200]] God [[H430]] called out [[H7121]] to him [[H413]] from within [[H8432]] the bush, [[H5572]] “Moses, [[H4872]] Moses!” [[H4872]] “Here [[H2009]] I am,” [[H559]] he answered. [[H559]]

### 5
“Do not [[H408]] come [[H7126]] any closer,” [[H1988]] [God] said. [[H559]] “Take off [[H5394]] your sandals, [[H5275]] for [[H3588]] the place [[H4725]] where [[H834]] you [[H859]] are standing [[H5975]] is holy [[H6944]] ground.” [[H127]]

### 6
Then He said, [[H559]] “I [[H595]] am the God [[H430]] of your father, [[H1]] the God [[H430]] of Abraham, [[H85]] the God [[H430]] of Isaac, [[H3327]] and the God [[H430]] of Jacob.” [[H3290]] At this, Moses [[H4872]] hid [[H5641]] his face, [[H6440]] for [[H3588]] he was afraid [[H3372]] to look [[H5027]] at [[H413]] God. [[H430]]

### 7
The LORD [[H3068]] said, [[H559]] “I have indeed seen [[H7200]] the misery [[H6040]] of My people [[H5971]] in Egypt. [[H4714]] I have heard [[H8085]] them crying out [[H6818]] because of [[H6440]] their oppressors, [[H5065]] and [[H3588]] I am aware [[H3045]] of their sufferings. [[H4341]]

### 8
I have come down [[H3381]] to rescue [[H5337]] them from [[H4480]] the hand [[H3027]] of the Egyptians [[H4713]] and to bring them [[H5927]] up out of that [[H1931]] land [[H776]] to [[H413]] a good [[H2896]] and spacious [[H7342]] land, [[H776]] a land [[H776]] flowing [[H2100]] with milk [[H2461]] and honey— [[H1706]] the home [[H4725]] of the Canaanites, [[H3669]] Hittites, [[H2850]] Amorites, [[H567]] Perizzites, [[H6522]] Hivites, [[H2340]] and Jebusites. [[H2983]]

### 9
And now [[H6258]] the cry [[H6818]] of the Israelites [[H1121]] has reached [[H935]] Me, [[H413]] and I have [[H1571]] seen [[H7200]] how severely [[H3906]] the Egyptians [[H4713]] are oppressing them. [[H3905]]

### 10
Therefore, [[H6258]] go! [[H1980]] I am sending [[H7971]] you to [[H413]] Pharaoh [[H6547]] to bring [[H3318]] My people, [[H5971]] the Israelites, [[H1121]] out of Egypt.” [[H4714]]

### 11
But Moses [[H4872]] asked [[H559]] God, [[H430]] “Who [[H4310]] am I, [[H595]] that [[H3588]] I should go [[H1980]] to [[H413]] Pharaoh [[H6547]] and [[H3588]] bring the Israelites [[H1121]] out [[H3318]] of Egypt?” [[H4714]]

### 12
“I will surely [[H3588]] be [[H1961]] with you,” [[H5973]] [God] said, [[H559]] “and this [[H2088]] will be the sign [[H226]] to you  that [[H3588]] I [[H595]] have sent you: [[H7971]] When you have brought the people [[H5971]] out [[H3318]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] all of you will worship [[H5647]] God [[H430]] on [[H5921]] this [[H2088]] mountain.” [[H2022]]

### 13
Then Moses [[H4872]] asked [[H559]] God, [[H430]] “Suppose [[H2009]] I [[H595]] go [[H935]] to [[H413]] the Israelites [[H1121]] and say [[H559]] to them,  ‘The God [[H430]] of your fathers [[H1]] has sent [[H7971]] me to you,’ [[H413]] and they ask [[H559]] me,  ‘What [[H4100]] is His name?’ [[H8034]] What [[H4100]] should I tell [[H559]] them?” [[H413]]

### 14
God [[H430]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] “I AM [[H1961]] WHO [[H834]] I AM. [[H1961]] This is what [[H3541]] you are to say [[H559]] to the Israelites: [[H1121]] ‘I AM [[H1961]] has sent me [[H7971]] to you.’” [[H413]]

### 15
God [[H430]] also [[H5750]] told [[H559]] Moses, [[H4872]] “Say [[H559]] to [[H413]] the Israelites, [[H1121]] ‘The LORD, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of your fathers— [[H1]] the God [[H430]] of Abraham, [[H85]] the God [[H430]] of Isaac, [[H3327]] and the God [[H430]] of Jacob— [[H3290]] has sent [[H7971]] me to you.’ [[H413]] This [[H2088]] is My name [[H8034]] forever, [[H5769]] and this [[H2088]] is how I am to be remembered [[H2143]] in every generation. [[H1755]]

### 16
Go, [[H1980]] assemble [[H622]] the elders [[H2205]] of Israel [[H3478]] and say [[H559]] to them, [[H413]] ‘The LORD, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of your fathers, [[H1]] the God [[H430]] of Abraham, [[H85]] Isaac, [[H3327]] and Jacob, [[H3290]] has appeared [[H7200]] to me [[H413]] and said: [[H559]] I have surely [[H6485]] attended [[H6485]] to you [[H853]] and [have seen] what has been done [[H6213]] to you  in Egypt. [[H4714]]

### 17
And I have promised [[H559]] to bring you up [[H5927]] out of your affliction [[H6040]] in Egypt, [[H4714]] into [[H413]] the land [[H776]] of the Canaanites, [[H3669]] Hittites, [[H2850]] Amorites, [[H567]] Perizzites, [[H6522]] Hivites, [[H2340]] and Jebusites— [[H2983]] a land [[H776]] flowing [[H2100]] with milk [[H2461]] and honey.’ [[H1706]]

### 18
[The elders of Israel] will listen [[H8085]] to what you say, [[H6963]] and you [[H859]] must go [[H935]] with [them] [[H2205]] to [[H413]] the king [[H4428]] of Egypt [[H4714]] and tell [[H559]] him, [[H413]] ‘The LORD, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of the Hebrews, [[H5680]] has met [[H7136]] with us. [[H5921]] Now [[H6258]] please [[H4994]] let us take [[H1980]] a three-day [[H7969]] journey [[H1870]] into the wilderness, [[H4057]] so that we may sacrifice [[H2076]] to the LORD [[H3068]] our God. [[H430]]

### 19
But I [[H589]] know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] the king [[H4428]] of Egypt [[H4714]] will not [[H3808]] allow [[H5414]] you to go [[H1980]] unless [[H3808]] a mighty hand compels him. [[H2389]]

### 20
So I will stretch out [[H7971]] My hand [[H3027]] and strike [[H5221]] the Egyptians [[H4713]] with all [[H3605]] the wonders [[H6381]] I will perform [[H6213]] among them. [[H7130]] And after [[H310]] that, [[H3651]] he will release [[H7971]] you. [[H853]]

### 21
And I will grant [[H5414]] this [[H2088]] people [[H5971]] such favor [[H2580]] in the sight [[H5869]] of the Egyptians [[H4713]] that when [[H3588]] you leave, [[H1980]] you will not [[H3808]] go away [[H1980]] empty-handed. [[H7387]]

### 22
Every [[H802]] woman shall ask [[H7592]] her neighbor [[H7934]] and any woman staying [[H1481]] in her house [[H1004]] for silver [[H3701]] and gold [[H2091]] jewelry [[H3627]] and clothing, [[H8071]] and you will put [[H7760]] them on [[H5921]] your sons [[H1121]] and daughters. [[H1323]] So you will plunder [[H5337]] the Egyptians.” [[H4713]]
