###### 1
Then the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] “Go [[H935]] to [[H413]] Pharaoh [[H6547]] and tell [[H1696]] him that [[H413]] this is what [[H3541]] the LORD, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of the Hebrews, [[H5680]] says: [[H559]] ‘Let My people [[H5971]] go, [[H7971]] so that they may worship Me. [[H5647]]

###### 2
But [[H3588]] if [[H518]] you [[H859]] refuse [[H3986]] to let them go [[H7971]] and continue [[H5750]] to restrain [[H2388]] them, 

###### 3
then [[H2009]] the hand [[H3027]] of the LORD [[H3068]] will bring [[H1961]] a severe [[H3515]] plague [[H1698]] on your livestock [[H4735]] in the field— [[H7704]] on your horses, [[H5483]] donkeys, [[H2543]] camels, [[H1581]] herds, [[H1241]] and flocks. [[H6629]]

###### 4
But the LORD [[H3068]] will make a distinction [[H6395]] between [[H996]] the livestock [[H4735]] of Israel [[H3478]] and the livestock [[H4735]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] so that no [animal] [[H3808]] belonging to [[H3605]] the Israelites [[H1121]] will die.’” [[H4191]]

###### 5
The LORD [[H3068]] set [[H7760]] a time, [[H4150]] saying, [[H559]] “Tomorrow [[H4279]] the LORD [[H3068]] will do [[H6213]] this [[H2088]] in the land.” [[H776]]

###### 6
And the next day [[H4283]] the LORD [[H3068]] did [[H6213]] just that. [[H2088]] All [[H3605]] the livestock [[H4735]] of the Egyptians [[H4713]] died, [[H4191]] but not [[H3808]] one [[H259]] animal [[H4735]] belonging to the Israelites [[H1121]] died. [[H4191]]

###### 7
So Pharaoh [[H6547]] sent officials, [[H7971]] who saw that [[H2009]] none [[H3808]] of the livestock [[H4735]] of the Israelites [[H3478]] had died. [[H4191]] But Pharaoh’s [[H6547]] heart [[H3820]] was hardened, [[H3513]] and he would not [[H3808]] let the people [[H5971]] go. [[H7971]]

###### 8
Then the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Moses [[H4872]] and Aaron, [[H175]] “Take [[H3947]] handfuls [[H4393]] of soot [[H6368]] from the furnace; [[H3536]] in the sight [[H5869]] of Pharaoh, [[H6547]] Moses [[H4872]] is to toss it [[H2236]] into the air. [[H8064]]

###### 9
It will become [[H1961]] fine dust [[H80]] over [[H5921]] all the [[H3605]] land [[H776]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] and [[H1961]] festering [[H76]] boils [[H7822]] will break out [[H6524]] on [[H5921]] man [[H120]] and beast [[H929]] throughout [[H3605]] the land.” [[H776]]

###### 10
So they took [[H3947]] soot [[H6368]] from the furnace [[H3536]] and stood [[H5975]] before [[H6440]] Pharaoh. [[H6547]] Moses [[H4872]] tossed [[H2236]] it [[H853]] into the air, [[H8064]] and [[H1961]] festering [[H76]] boils [[H7822]] broke out [[H6524]] on man [[H120]] and beast. [[H929]]

###### 11
The magicians [[H2748]] could [[H3201]] not [[H3808]] stand [[H5975]] before [[H6440]] Moses, [[H4872]] because [[H6440]] the boils [[H7822]] had broken out [[H1961]] on [them] [[H2748]] and on all [[H3605]] the Egyptians. [[H4713]]

###### 12
But the LORD [[H3068]] hardened [[H2388]] Pharaoh’s [[H6547]] heart, [[H3820]] and he would not [[H3808]] listen [[H8085]] to them, [[H413]] just as [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] had told [[H1696]] Moses. [[H4872]]

###### 13
Then the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] “Get up early [[H7925]] in the morning, [[H1242]] stand [[H3320]] before [[H6440]] Pharaoh, [[H6547]] and tell [[H559]] him that [[H413]] this is what [[H3541]] the LORD, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of the Hebrews, [[H5680]] says: [[H559]] ‘Let My people [[H5971]] go, [[H7971]] so that they may worship Me. [[H5647]]

###### 14
Otherwise, [[H3588]] I [[H589]] will send [[H7971]] all [[H3605]] My plagues [[H4046]] against [[H413]] you [[H3820]] and your officials [[H5650]] and your people, [[H5971]] so [[H5668]] you may know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] [there is] no one [[H369]] like Me [[H3644]] in all [[H3605]] the earth. [[H776]]

###### 15
For [[H3588]] by this time [[H6258]] I could have stretched out [[H7971]] My hand [[H3027]] and struck [[H5221]] you [[H853]] and [[H853]] your people [[H5971]] with a plague [[H1698]] to wipe you [[H3582]] off [[H4480]] the earth. [[H776]]

###### 16
But [[H199]] I have raised you up [[H5975]] for this very purpose, [[H2063]] that [[H5668]] I might display [[H7200]] to you [[H853]] My power, [[H3581]] and that [[H4616]] My name [[H8034]] might be proclaimed [[H5608]] in all [[H3605]] the earth. [[H776]]

###### 17
Still, [[H5750]] you lord it [[H5549]] over My people [[H5971]] and do not [[H1115]] allow them to go. [[H7971]]

###### 18
Behold, [[H2005]] at this time [[H6256]] tomorrow [[H4279]] I will rain down [[H4305]] the worst [[H3515]] hail [[H1259]] that [[H834]] has ever [[H3808]] fallen [[H1961]] on Egypt, [[H4714]] from [[H4480]] the day [[H3117]] it was founded [[H3245]] until [[H5704]] now. [[H6258]]

###### 19
So [[H6258]] give orders {now} [[H7971]] to shelter [[H5756]] your livestock [[H4735]] and everything [[H3605]] you  have in the field. [[H7704]] Every [[H3605]] man [[H120]] or beast [[H929]] that [[H834]] remains [[H4672]] in the field [[H7704]] and is not [[H3808]] brought [[H622]] inside [[H1004]] will die [[H4191]] when the hail [[H1259]] comes down [[H3381]] upon them. [[H5921]]

###### 20
Those among Pharaoh’s [[H6547]] officials [[H5650]] who feared [[H3372]] the word [[H1697]] of the LORD [[H3068]] hurried to bring [[H5127]] their servants [[H5650]] and livestock [[H4735]] to [[H413]] shelter, [[H1004]]

###### 21
but those who [[H834]] disregarded [[H7760]] the word [[H1697]] of the LORD [[H3068]] left [[H5800]] their servants [[H5650]] and livestock [[H4735]] in the field. [[H7704]]

###### 22
Then the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] “Stretch out [[H5186]] your hand [[H3027]] toward [[H5921]] heaven, [[H8064]] so that hail [[H1259]] may fall [[H1961]] on all [[H3605]] the land [[H776]] of Egypt— [[H4714]] on [[H5921]] man [[H120]] and beast [[H929]] and every [[H3605]] plant [[H6212]] of the field [[H7704]] throughout the land [[H776]] of Egypt. [[H4714]]

###### 23
So Moses [[H4872]] stretched out [[H5186]] his staff [[H4294]] toward [[H5921]] heaven, [[H8064]] and the LORD [[H3068]] sent [[H5414]] thunder [[H6963]] and hail, [[H1259]] and lightning [[H784]] struck [[H1980]] the earth. [[H776]] So the LORD [[H3068]] rained [[H4305]] hail [[H1259]] upon [[H5921]] the land [[H776]] of Egypt. [[H4714]]

###### 24
The hail [[H1259]] fell [[H1961]] and the lightning [[H784]] continued flashing [[H3947]] through it. [[H8432]] The hail [[H1259]] was so [[H3966]] severe [[H3515]] that [[H834]] nothing [[H3808]] like it [[H3644]] had ever been [seen] [[H1961]] in all [[H3605]] the land [[H776]] of Egypt [[H4714]] from the time [[H227]] it became [[H1961]] a nation. [[H1471]]

###### 25
Throughout [[H3605]] the land [[H776]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] the hail [[H1259]] struck down [[H5221]] everything [[H3605]] in the field, [[H7704]] both man [[H120]] and [[H5704]] beast; [[H929]] [it] [[H1259]] beat down [[H5221]] every [[H3605]] plant [[H6212]] of the field [[H7704]] and stripped [[H7665]] every [[H3605]] tree. [[H6086]]

###### 26
The only [[H7535]] place where it did not [[H3808]] hail [[H1259]] was [[H1961]] in the land [[H776]] of Goshen, [[H1657]] where [[H834]] the Israelites [[H1121]] [lived]. [[H8033]]

###### 27
Then Pharaoh [[H6547]] summoned [[H7971]] Moses [[H4872]] and Aaron. [[H175]] “This time [[H6471]] I have sinned,” [[H2398]] he said. [[H559]] “The LORD [[H3068]] [is] righteous, [[H6662]] and I [[H589]] and my people [[H5971]] [are] wicked. [[H7563]]

###### 28
Pray [[H6279]] to [[H413]] the LORD, [[H3068]] for there has been [[H1961]] enough [[H7227]] of God’s [[H430]] thunder [[H6963]] and hail. [[H1259]] I will let you go; [[H7971]] you do not [[H3808]] need to stay [[H5975]] any longer.” [[H3254]]

###### 29
Moses [[H4872]] said [[H559]] to him, [[H413]] “When I have left [[H3318]] the city, [[H5892]] I will spread out [[H6566]] my hands [[H3709]] to [[H413]] the LORD. [[H3068]] The thunder [[H6963]] will cease, [[H2308]] and there will be [[H1961]] no [[H3808]] more [[H5750]] hail, [[H1259]] so that [[H4616]] you may know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] the earth [[H776]] [is] the LORD’s. [[H3068]]

###### 30
But as for you [[H859]] and your officials, [[H5650]] I know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] you still do not [[H2962]] fear [[H3372]] the LORD [[H3068]] our God.” [[H430]]

###### 31
(Now the flax [[H6594]] and barley [[H8184]] were destroyed, [[H5221]] since [[H3588]] the barley [[H8184]] was ripe and the flax [[H6594]] [was] in bloom; [[H1392]]

###### 32
but the wheat [[H2406]] and the spelt [[H3698]] were not [[H3808]] destroyed, [[H5221]] because [[H3588]] they [[H2007]] are late crops.) [[H648]]

###### 33
Then Moses [[H4872]] departed [[H3318]] from [[H5973]] Pharaoh, [[H6547]] [went] out of the city, [[H5892]] and spread out [[H6566]] his hands [[H3709]] to [[H413]] the LORD. [[H3068]] The thunder [[H6963]] and hail [[H1259]] ceased, [[H2308]] and the rain [[H4306]] no longer [[H3808]] poured down [[H5413]] on the land. [[H776]]

###### 34
When Pharaoh [[H6547]] saw [[H7200]] that [[H3588]] the rain [[H4306]] and hail [[H1259]] and thunder [[H6963]] had ceased, [[H2308]] he sinned [[H2398]] again [[H3254]] and hardened [[H3513]] his heart— [[H3820]] he [[H1931]] and his officials. [[H5650]]

###### 35
So Pharaoh’s [[H6547]] heart [[H3820]] was hardened, [[H2388]] and he would not [[H3808]] let the Israelites [[H1121]] go, [[H7971]] just as [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] had said [[H1696]] through [[H3027]] Moses. [[H4872]]
