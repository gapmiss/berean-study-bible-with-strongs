### 1
In the third [[H7992]] month, [[H2320]] on the same [[H2088]] day [of the month] [[H3117]] that the Israelites [[H1121]] had left [[H3318]] Egypt, [[H4714]] they came [[H935]] to the Desert [[H4057]] of Sinai. [[H5514]]

### 2
After they had set out [[H5265]] from Rephidim, [[H7508]] they entered [[H935]] the Desert [[H4057]] of Sinai, [[H5514]] and Israel [[H3478]] camped [[H2583]] there [[H8033]] in front of [[H5048]] the mountain. [[H2022]]

### 3
Then Moses [[H4872]] went up [[H5927]] to [[H413]] God, [[H430]] and the LORD [[H3068]] called [[H7121]] to [[H413]] him from [[H4480]] the mountain, [[H2022]] “This is what [[H3541]] you are to tell [[H559]] the house [[H1004]] of Jacob [[H3290]] and explain [[H5046]] to the sons [[H1121]] of Israel: [[H3478]]

### 4
‘You [[H859]] have seen for yourselves [[H7200]] what [[H834]] I did [[H6213]] to Egypt, [[H4713]] and how I carried [[H5375]] you on [[H5921]] eagles’ [[H5404]] wings [[H3671]] and brought [[H935]] you [[H853]] to Myself. [[H413]]

### 5
Now [[H6258]] if [[H518]] you will indeed [[H8085]] obey [[H8085]] My voice [[H6963]] and keep [[H8104]] My covenant, [[H1285]] you will be [[H1961]] My treasured possession [[H5459]] out of all [[H3605]] the nations— [[H5971]] for [[H3588]] the whole [[H3605]] earth [[H776]] is Mine. 

### 6
And unto Me  you [[H859]] shall be [[H1961]] a kingdom [[H4467]] of priests [[H3548]] and a holy [[H6918]] nation.’ [[H1471]] These [[H428]] are the words [[H1697]] that [[H834]] you are to speak [[H1696]] to [[H413]] the Israelites.” [[H1121]]

### 7
So Moses [[H4872]] went back [[H935]] and summoned [[H7121]] the elders [[H2205]] of the people [[H5971]] and set [[H7760]] before [[H6440]] them all [[H3605]] these [[H428]] words [[H1697]] that [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] had commanded him. [[H6680]]

### 8
And all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] answered [[H6030]] together, [[H3162]] “We will do [[H6213]] everything [[H3605]] that [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] has spoken.” [[H1696]] So Moses [brought] [[H4872]] [their] [[H5971]] words [[H1697]] back [[H7725]] to [[H413]] the LORD. [[H3068]]

### 9
The LORD [[H3068]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] “Behold, [[H2009]] I [[H595]] will come [[H935]] to [[H413]] you in a dense [[H5645]] cloud, [[H6051]] so that [[H5668]] the people [[H5971]] will hear [[H8085]] when I speak [[H1696]] with you, [[H5973]] and [[H1571]] they will always [[H5769]] put their trust [[H539]] in you.”  And Moses [[H4872]] relayed [[H5046]] the words [[H1697]] of the people [[H5971]] to [[H413]] the LORD. [[H3068]]

### 10
Then the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H559]] to Moses, [[H4872]] “Go [[H1980]] to [[H413]] the people [[H5971]] and consecrate [[H6942]] them today [[H3117]] and tomorrow. [[H4279]] They must wash [[H3526]] their clothes [[H8071]]

### 11
and be [[H1961]] prepared [[H3559]] by the third [[H7992]] day, [[H3117]] for [[H3588]] on the third [[H7992]] day [[H3117]] the LORD [[H3068]] will come down [[H3381]] on [[H5921]] Mount [[H2022]] Sinai [[H5514]] in the sight [[H5869]] of all [[H3605]] the people. [[H5971]]

### 12
And you are to set up a boundary [[H1379]] for the people [[H5971]] around [the mountain] [[H5439]] and tell them, [[H559]] ‘Be careful [[H8104]] not to go up [[H5927]] on the mountain [[H2022]] or touch [[H5060]] its base. [[H7097]] Whoever [[H3605]] touches [[H5060]] the mountain [[H2022]] shall surely [[H4191]] be put to death. [[H4191]]

### 13
No [[H3808]] hand [[H3027]] shall touch him, [[H5060]] but [[H3588]] he shall surely [[H5619]] be stoned [[H5619]] or [[H176]] shot [[H3384]] with arrows— [[H3384]] whether [[H518]] man [[H376]] or [[H518]] beast, [[H929]] he must not [[H3808]] live.’ [[H2421]] Only when the ram’s horn [[H3104]] sounds a long blast [[H4900]] may they [[H1992]] go up [[H5927]] the mountain.” [[H2022]]

### 14
When Moses [[H4872]] came down [[H3381]] from [[H4480]] the mountain [[H2022]] to [[H413]] the people, [[H5971]] he consecrated them, [[H6942]] and they washed [[H3526]] their clothes. [[H8071]]

### 15
“Be [[H1961]] prepared [[H3559]] for the third [[H7969]] day,” [[H3117]] he said [[H559]] to [[H413]] the people. [[H5971]] “Do not [[H408]] draw near [[H5066]] to [[H413]] a woman.” [[H802]]

### 16
On the third [[H7992]] day, [[H3117]] when morning [[H1242]] came, [[H1961]] there was [[H1961]] thunder [[H6963]] and lightning. [[H1300]] A thick [[H3515]] cloud [[H6051]] was upon [[H5921]] the mountain, [[H2022]] with a very loud [[H2389]] trumpet [[H7782]] blast, [[H6963]] so that all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] in the camp [[H4264]] trembled. [[H2729]]

### 17
Then Moses [[H4872]] brought the people [[H5971]] out [[H3318]] of [[H4480]] the camp [[H4264]] to meet [[H7125]] with God, [[H430]] and they stood [[H3320]] at the foot [[H8482]] of the mountain. [[H2022]]

### 18
Mount [[H2022]] Sinai [[H5514]] was completely [[H3605]] enveloped in smoke, [[H6225]] because [[H6440]] the LORD [[H3068]] had descended [[H3381]] on it [[H5921]] in fire. [[H784]] And smoke [[H6227]] rose [[H5927]] like the smoke [[H6227]] of a furnace, [[H3536]] and the whole [[H3605]] mountain [[H2022]] quaked [[H2729]] violently. [[H3966]]

### 19
And as [[H1961]] the sound [[H6963]] of the trumpet [[H7782]] grew louder [[H1980]] and louder, [[H3966]] Moses [[H4872]] spoke, [[H1696]] and God [[H430]] answered him [[H6030]] in the thunder. [[H6963]]

### 20
The LORD [[H3068]] descended [[H3381]] to [[H413]] the top [[H7218]] of [[H5921]] Mount [[H2022]] Sinai [[H5514]] [and] [[H3068]] called [[H7121]] Moses [[H4872]] to [[H413]] the summit. [[H7218]] So [Moses] [[H4872]] went up, [[H5927]]

### 21
and the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H559]] to [him], [[H4872]] “Go down [[H3381]] and warn [[H5749]] the people [[H5971]] not [[H6435]] to break through [[H2040]] to see [[H7200]] the LORD, [[H3068]] [lest] many [[H7227]] of them [[H4480]] perish. [[H5307]]

### 22
Even [[H1571]] the priests [[H3548]] who come near [[H5066]] the LORD [[H3068]] must consecrate themselves, [[H6942]] or [[H6435]] the LORD [[H3068]] will break out [[H6555]] against them.” 

### 23
But Moses [[H4872]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] the LORD, [[H3068]] “The people [[H5971]] cannot [[H3808]] come up [[H5927]] Mount [[H2022]] Sinai, [[H5514]] for [[H3588]] You [[H859]] solemnly warned [[H5749]] us,  ‘Put a boundary around [[H1379]] the mountain [[H2022]] and set it apart as holy.’” [[H6942]]

### 24
And the LORD [[H3068]] replied, [[H559]] “Go [[H1980]] down [[H3381]] and bring [[H5927]] Aaron [[H175]] with [[H5973]] you. [[H859]] But the priests [[H3548]] and the people [[H5971]] must not [[H408]] break through [[H2040]] to come up [[H5927]] to [[H413]] the LORD, [[H3068]] or [[H6435]] He will break out [[H6555]] against them.” 

### 25
So Moses [[H4872]] went down [[H3381]] to [[H413]] the people [[H5971]] and spoke [[H559]] to them. [[H413]]
