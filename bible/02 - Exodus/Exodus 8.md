### 1
Then the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] “Go [[H935]] to [[H413]] Pharaoh [[H6547]] and tell him that [[H559]] this is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] says: [[H559]] ‘Let My people [[H5971]] go, [[H7971]] so that they may worship Me. [[H5647]]

### 2
But if [[H518]] you [[H859]] refuse [[H3986]] to let them go, [[H7971]] I [[H595]] will plague [[H5062]] your whole country [[H1366]] with frogs. [[H6854]]

### 3
The Nile [[H2975]] will teem [[H8317]] with frogs, [[H6854]] and they will come [[H5927]] into your palace [[H1004]] and up to your bedroom [[H2315]] and onto [[H5921]] your bed, [[H4296]] into the houses [[H1004]] of your officials [[H5650]] and your people, [[H5971]] and into your ovens [[H8574]] and kneading bowls. [[H4863]]

### 4
The frogs [[H6854]] will come up on you [[H5927]] and your people [[H5971]] and all [[H3605]] your officials.’” [[H5650]]

### 5
And the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] “Tell [[H559]] Aaron, [[H175]] ‘Stretch out [[H5186]] your hand [[H3027]] with your staff [[H4294]] over [[H5921]] the rivers [[H5104]] and canals [[H2975]] and ponds, [[H98]] and cause the frogs [[H6854]] to come up [[H5927]] onto [[H5921]] the land [[H776]] of Egypt.’” [[H4714]]

### 6
So Aaron [[H175]] stretched out [[H5186]] his hand [[H3027]] over [[H5921]] the waters [[H4325]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] and the frogs [[H6854]] came up [[H5927]] and covered [[H3680]] the land [[H776]] of Egypt. [[H4714]]

### 7
But the magicians [[H2748]] did [[H6213]] the same thing [[H3651]] by their magic arts, [[H3909]] and they also brought frogs [[H6854]] up [[H5927]] onto [[H5921]] the land [[H776]] of Egypt. [[H4714]]

### 8
Pharaoh [[H6547]] summoned [[H7121]] Moses [[H4872]] and Aaron [[H175]] and said, [[H559]] “Pray [[H6279]] to [[H413]] the LORD [[H3068]] to take [[H5493]] the frogs [[H6854]] away from [[H4480]] me and my people. [[H5971]] Then I will let your people [[H5971]] go, [[H7971]] that they may sacrifice [[H2076]] to the LORD.” [[H3068]]

### 9
Moses [[H4872]] said [[H559]] to Pharaoh, [[H6547]] “You may have the honor [[H6286]] over me. [[H5921]] When [[H4970]] shall I pray [[H6279]] for you  and your officials [[H5650]] and your people [[H5971]] that the frogs [[H6854]] (except for those [[H7604]] in the Nile) [[H2975]] may be taken away [[H3772]] from [[H4480]] you and your houses?” [[H1004]]

### 10
“Tomorrow,” [[H4279]] [Pharaoh] answered. [[H559]] “It will be as you say,” [[H1697]] Moses replied, [[H559]] “so that [[H4616]] you may know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] there is no one [[H369]] like the LORD [[H3068]] our God. [[H430]]

### 11
The frogs [[H6854]] will depart [[H5493]] from you [[H4480]] and your houses [[H1004]] and your officials [[H5650]] and your people; [[H5971]] they will remain [[H7604]] only [[H7535]] in the Nile.” [[H2975]]

### 12
After Moses [[H4872]] and Aaron [[H175]] had left [[H3318]] Pharaoh, [[H6547]] Moses [[H4872]] cried out to [[H413]] the LORD [[H3068]] for help [[H6817]] with [[H1697]] the frogs [[H6854]] that [[H834]] He had brought [[H7760]] against Pharaoh. [[H6547]]

### 13
And the LORD [[H3068]] did [[H6213]] as Moses [[H4872]] requested, [[H1697]] and the frogs [[H6854]] in [[H4480]] the houses, [[H1004]] the courtyards, [[H2691]] and the fields [[H7704]] died. [[H4191]]

### 14
The people piled [[H6651]] them into countless heaps, [[H2563]] and there was a terrible stench [[H887]] in the land. [[H776]]

### 15
When Pharaoh [[H6547]] saw [[H7200]] there was [[H1961]] relief, however, [[H7309]] he hardened [[H3513]] his heart [[H3820]] and would not [[H3808]] listen [[H8085]] to [Moses and Aaron], [[H413]] just as [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] had said. [[H1696]]

### 16
Then the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] “Tell [[H559]] Aaron, [[H175]] ‘Stretch out [[H5186]] your staff [[H4294]] and strike [[H5221]] the dust [[H6083]] of the earth, [[H776]] that it may turn into [[H1961]] swarms of gnats [[H3654]] throughout [[H3605]] the land [[H776]] of Egypt.’” [[H4714]]

### 17
This they did, [[H6213]] and when Aaron [[H175]] stretched out [[H5186]] his hand [[H3027]] with his staff [[H4294]] and struck [[H5221]] the dust [[H6083]] of the earth, [[H776]] gnats [[H3654]] came upon [[H1961]] man [[H120]] and beast. [[H929]] All [[H3605]] the dust [[H6083]] of the earth [[H776]] turned into [[H1961]] gnats [[H3654]] throughout [[H3605]] the land [[H776]] of Egypt. [[H4714]]

### 18
The magicians [[H2748]] tried [[H6213]] to produce [[H3318]] gnats [[H3654]] using their magic arts, [[H3909]] but they could [[H3201]] not. [[H3808]] And the gnats [[H3654]] remained [[H1961]] on man [[H120]] and beast. [[H929]]

### 19
“This [[H1931]] is the finger [[H676]] of God,” [[H430]] the magicians [[H2748]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Pharaoh. [[H6547]] But Pharaoh’s [[H6547]] heart [[H3820]] was hardened, [[H2388]] and he would not [[H3808]] listen [[H8085]] to them, [[H413]] just as [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] had said. [[H1696]]

### 20
Then the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] “Get up early [[H7925]] in the morning, [[H1242]] and when Pharaoh [[H6547]] goes out [[H3318]] to the water, [[H4325]] stand [[H3320]] before him [[H6440]] and tell [[H559]] him that [[H413]] this is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] says: [[H559]] ‘Let My people [[H5971]] go, [[H7971]] so that they may worship Me. [[H5647]]

### 21
But [[H3588]] if [[H518]] you will not [[H369]] let My people [[H5971]] go, [[H7971]] I will send [[H7971]] swarms of flies [[H6157]] upon you  and your officials [[H5650]] and your people [[H5971]] and your houses. [[H1004]] The houses [[H1004]] of the Egyptians [[H4713]] and even [[H1571]] the ground [[H127]] where they [stand] [[H1992]] will be full [[H4390]] of flies. [[H6157]]

### 22
But on that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] I will give special treatment [[H6395]] to the land [[H776]] of Goshen, [[H1657]] where [[H834]] My people [[H5971]] live; [[H5975]] no [[H1115]] swarms [of flies] [[H6157]] will be [found] [[H1961]] there. [[H8033]] In this way [[H4616]] you will know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I, [[H589]] the LORD, [[H3068]] am in [[H7130]] the land. [[H776]]

### 23
I will make [[H7760]] a distinction [[H6304]] between [[H996]] My people [[H5971]] and your people. [[H5971]] This [[H2088]] sign [[H226]] will take place [[H1961]] tomorrow.’” [[H4279]]

### 24
And the LORD [[H3068]] did [[H6213]] so. [[H3651]] Thick [[H3515]] swarms of flies [[H6157]] poured [[H935]] into Pharaoh’s [[H6547]] palace [[H1004]] and into the houses [[H1004]] of his officials. [[H5650]] Throughout [[H3605]] Egypt [[H4714]] the land [[H776]] was ruined [[H7843]] by [[H6440]] swarms of flies. [[H6157]]

### 25
Then Pharaoh [[H6547]] summoned [[H7121]] Moses [[H4872]] and Aaron [[H175]] and said, [[H559]] “Go, [[H1980]] sacrifice [[H2076]] to your God [[H430]] within this land.” [[H776]]

### 26
But Moses [[H4872]] replied, [[H559]] “It would not [[H3808]] be right [[H3559]] to do [[H6213]] that, [[H3651]] because [[H3588]] the sacrifices we offer [[H2076]] to the LORD [[H3068]] our God [[H430]] would be detestable [[H8441]] to the Egyptians. [[H4713]] If [[H2005]] we offer sacrifices [[H2076]] that are [[H853]] detestable [[H8441]] before [[H5869]] the Egyptians, [[H4713]] will they not [[H3808]] stone us? [[H5619]]

### 27
We must make [[H1980]] a three-day [[H7969]] journey [[H1870]] into the wilderness [[H4057]] and sacrifice [[H2076]] to the LORD [[H3068]] our God [[H430]] as [[H834]] He commands us.” [[H559]]

### 28
Pharaoh [[H6547]] answered, [[H559]] “I [[H595]] will let you go [[H7971]] and sacrifice [[H2076]] to the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] in the wilderness, [[H4057]] but [[H7535]] you must not [[H3808]] go [[H1980]] very far. [[H7368]] Now pray [[H6279]] for me.” [[H1157]]

### 29
“As soon as I [[H595]] leave you,” [[H3318]] Moses [[H4872]] said, [[H559]] “I will pray [[H6279]] to [[H413]] the LORD, [[H3068]] so that tomorrow [[H4279]] the swarms of flies [[H6157]] will depart [[H5493]] from Pharaoh [[H6547]] and his officials [[H5650]] and his people. [[H5971]] But [[H7535]] Pharaoh [[H6547]] must not [[H408]] act deceitfully [[H2048]] again [[H3254]] by refusing [[H1115]] to let the people [[H5971]] go [[H7971]] and sacrifice [[H2076]] to the LORD.” [[H3068]]

### 30
Then Moses [[H4872]] left [[H3318]] Pharaoh [[H6547]] and prayed [[H6279]] to [[H413]] the LORD, [[H3068]]

### 31
and the LORD [[H3068]] did [[H6213]] as Moses [[H4872]] requested. [[H1697]] He removed [[H5493]] the swarms of flies [[H6157]] from Pharaoh [[H6547]] and his officials [[H5650]] and his people; [[H5971]] not [[H3808]] one [fly] [[H259]] remained. [[H7604]]

### 32
But Pharaoh [[H6547]] hardened [[H3513]] his heart [[H3820]] this [[H2063]] time [[H6471]] as well, [[H1571]] and he would not [[H3808]] let the people [[H5971]] go. [[H7971]]
