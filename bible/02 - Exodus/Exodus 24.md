###### 1
Then [the LORD] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] “Come up [[H5927]] to [[H413]] the LORD— [[H3068]] you [[H859]] and Aaron, [[H175]] Nadab [[H5070]] and Abihu, [[H30]] and seventy [[H7657]] of Israel’s [[H3478]] elders— [[H2205]] and you are to worship [[H7812]] at a distance. [[H7350]]

###### 2
Moses [[H4872]] alone [[H905]] shall approach [[H5066]] the LORD, [[H3068]] but the others [[H1992]] {must} not [[H3808]] come near. [[H5066]] And the people [[H5971]] may not [[H3808]] go up [[H5927]] with him.” [[H5973]]

###### 3
When Moses [[H4872]] came [[H935]] and told [[H5608]] the people [[H5971]] all [[H3605]] the words [[H1697]] and [[H3605]] ordinances [[H4941]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] [they] [[H5971]] all [[H3605]] responded [[H6030]] with one [[H259]] voice: [[H6963]] “All [[H3605]] the words [[H1697]] that [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] has spoken, [[H1696]] we will do.” [[H6213]]

###### 4
And Moses [[H4872]] wrote down [[H3789]] all [[H3605]] the words [[H1697]] of the LORD. [[H3068]] {Early} the next morning [[H1242]] he got up [[H7925]] and built [[H1129]] an altar [[H4196]] at the base of [[H8478]] the mountain, [[H2022]] along with twelve [[H8147]] pillars [[H4676]] for the twelve [[H8147]] tribes [[H7626]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

###### 5
Then he sent out [[H7971]] some young men [[H5288]] of Israel, [[H3478]] and they offered [[H5927]] burnt offerings [[H5930]] and sacrificed [[H2076]] young bulls [[H6499]] as peace [[H8002]] offerings [[H2077]] to the LORD. [[H3068]]

###### 6
Moses [[H4872]] took [[H3947]] half [[H2677]] of the blood [[H1818]] and put [[H7760]] it in basins, [[H101]] and the other half [[H2677]] he sprinkled [[H2236]] on [[H5921]] the altar. [[H4196]]

###### 7
Then he took [[H3947]] the Book [[H5612]] of the Covenant [[H1285]] and read it [[H7121]] to the people, [[H5971]] who replied, [[H559]] “All [[H3605]] that [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] has spoken [[H1696]] we will do, [[H6213]] and we will be obedient.” [[H8085]]

###### 8
So Moses [[H4872]] took [[H3947]] the blood, [[H1818]] sprinkled [[H2236]] it on [[H5921]] the people, [[H5971]] and said, [[H559]] “This [[H2009]] is the blood [[H1818]] of the covenant [[H1285]] that [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] has made [[H3772]] with you [[H5973]] in accordance with [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] these [[H428]] words.” [[H1697]]

###### 9
Then Moses [[H4872]] went up [[H5927]] with Aaron, [[H175]] Nadab [[H5070]] and Abihu, [[H30]] and seventy [[H7657]] of the elders [[H2205]] of Israel, [[H3478]]

###### 10
and they saw [[H7200]] the God [[H430]] of Israel. [[H3478]] Under [[H8478]] His feet [[H7272]] was a work [[H4639]] like a pavement [[H3840]] made of sapphire, [[H5601]] as clear [[H2892]] as the sky itself. [[H8064]]

###### 11
But [[H413]] God [[H430]] did not [[H3808]] lay [[H7971]] His hand [[H3027]] on the nobles [[H678]] of Israel; [[H3478]] they saw [[H2372]] Him, [[H853]] and they ate [[H398]] and drank. [[H8354]]

###### 12
Then the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] “Come up [[H5927]] to Me [[H413]] on the mountain [[H2022]] and stay [[H1961]] here, [[H8033]] so that I may give [[H5414]] you  the tablets [[H3871]] of stone, [[H68]] with the law [[H8451]] and commandments [[H4687]] I have written [[H3789]] for their instruction.” [[H3384]]

###### 13
So Moses [[H4872]] set out [[H6965]] with Joshua [[H3091]] his attendant [[H8334]] and went up [[H5927]] on [[H413]] the mountain [[H2022]] of God. [[H430]]

###### 14
And he said [[H559]] to the elders, [[H2205]] “Wait [[H3427]] here [[H2088]] for us until [[H5704]] we return [[H7725]] to you. [[H413]] Aaron [[H175]] and Hur [[H2354]] are here [[H2009]] with you. [[H5973]] Whoever [[H4310]] has a dispute [[H1697]] can go [[H5066]] to them.” [[H413]]

###### 15
When Moses [[H4872]] went up [[H5927]] on the mountain, [[H2022]] the cloud [[H6051]] covered it, [[H3680]]

###### 16
and the glory [[H3519]] of the LORD [[H3068]] settled [[H7931]] on [[H5921]] Mount [[H2022]] Sinai. [[H5514]] For six [[H8337]] days [[H3117]] the cloud [[H6051]] covered it, [[H3680]] and on the seventh [[H7637]] day [[H3117]] [the LORD] called [[H7121]] to [[H413]] Moses [[H4872]] from within [[H8432]] the cloud. [[H6051]]

###### 17
And the sight [[H4758]] of the glory [[H3519]] of the LORD [[H3068]] was like a consuming [[H398]] fire [[H784]] on the mountaintop [[H7218]] in the eyes [[H5869]] of the Israelites. [[H1121]]

###### 18
Moses [[H4872]] entered [[H935]] the cloud [[H6051]] as he went up [[H5927]] on [[H413]] the mountain, [[H2022]] and he [[H4872]] remained [[H1961]] on the mountain [[H2022]] forty [[H705]] days [[H3117]] and forty [[H705]] nights. [[H3915]]
