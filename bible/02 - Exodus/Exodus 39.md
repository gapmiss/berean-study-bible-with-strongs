From [[H4480]] the blue, [[H8504]] purple, [[H713]] and scarlet yarn [[H8438]] [the craftsmen] made [[H6213]] specially woven [[H8278]] garments [[H899]] for ministry [[H8334]] in the sanctuary, [[H6944]] as well as the holy [[H6944]] garments [[H899]] for Aaron, [[H175]] just as [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] had commanded [[H6680]] Moses. [[H4872]]

Bezalel made [[H6213]] the ephod [[H646]] out of gold, [[H2091]] with blue, [[H8504]] purple, [[H713]] and scarlet yarn, [[H8438]] and finely spun [[H7806]] linen. [[H8336]]

### 3
They hammered out [[H7554]] thin sheets [[H6341]] of gold [[H2091]] and cut [[H7112]] threads from them [[H6616]] to interweave [[H6213]] with the blue, [[H8504]] purple, [[H713]] and scarlet yarn, [[H8438]] and fine linen— [[H8336]] the work [[H4639]] of a skilled craftsman. [[H2803]]

### 4
They made [[H6213]] shoulder pieces [[H3802]] for [the ephod],  which were joined [[H2266]] to [[H5921]] two [[H8147]] of its corners [[H7118]] for fastening it. [[H2266]]

### 5
And the skillfully woven waistband [[H2805]] of [[H5921]] the ephod [[H642]] was of one piece with the ephod, [[H4480]] with the same [[H1931]] workmanship [[H4639]] of gold, [[H2091]] with blue, [[H8504]] purple, [[H713]] and scarlet yarn, [[H8438]] and finely spun [[H7806]] linen, [[H8336]] just as [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] had commanded [[H6680]] Moses.

and fastened [[H7760]] them on [[H5921]] the shoulder pieces [[H3802]] of the ephod [[H646]] as memorial [[H2146]] stones [[H68]] for the sons [[H1121]] of Israel, [[H3478]] as [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] had commanded [[H6680]] Moses. [[H4872]]

### 8
He also made [[H6213]] the breastpiece [[H2833]] of gold [[H2091]] like the ephod, [[H646]] using the work [[H4639]] of a skilled [[H2803]] craftsman, [[H4639]] with blue, [[H8504]] purple, [[H713]] and scarlet yarn, [[H8438]] and finely spun [[H7806]] linen. [[H8336]]

### 10
And they mounted [[H4390]] on it  four [[H702]] rows [[H2905]] of gemstones. [[H68]] The first [[H259]] row [had] [[H2905]] a ruby, [[H124]] a topaz, [[H6357]] and an emerald; [[H1304]]

### 13
and the fourth [[H7243]] row [had] [[H2905]] a beryl, [[H8658]] an onyx, [[H7718]] and a jasper. [[H3471]] These were mounted [[H4142]] in gold [[H2091]] filigree [[H4865]] settings. [[H4396]]

### 14
The twelve [[H8147]] stones [[H68]] corresponded to the names [[H8034]] of the sons [[H1121]] of Israel. [[H3478]] Each [[H376]] stone was engraved [[H6603]] like a seal [[H2368]] with [[H5921]] one of the names [[H8034]] of the twelve [[H8147]] tribes. [[H7626]]

### 15
For [[H5921]] the breastpiece [[H2833]] they made [[H6213]] braided [[H1383]] chains [[H8333]] of pure [[H2889]] gold [[H2091]] cord. [[H5688]]

### 16
They also fashioned [[H6213]] two [[H8147]] gold [[H2091]] filigree settings [[H4865]] and two [[H8147]] gold [[H2091]] rings, [[H2885]] and fastened [[H5414]] the two [[H8147]] rings [[H2885]] to [[H5921]] its [[H2833]] two [[H8147]] corners. [[H7098]]

### 17
Then they fastened [[H5414]] the two [[H8147]] gold [[H2091]] chains [[H5688]] to [[H5921]] the two [[H8147]] gold rings [[H2885]] at [[H5921]] the corners [[H7098]] of the breastpiece, [[H2833]]

### 18
and [[H853]] they fastened [[H5414]] the other [[H8147]] ends [[H7098]] of the two [[H8147]] chains [[H5688]] to [[H5921]] the two [[H8147]] filigree settings, [[H4865]] attaching [[H5414]] them to [[H5921]] the shoulder pieces [[H3802]] of the ephod [[H646]] at [[H413]] the front. [[H4136]]

### 21
Then they tied [[H7405]] the rings [[H2885]] of the breastpiece [[H2833]] to [[H413]] the rings [[H2885]] of the ephod [[H646]] with a cord [[H6616]] of blue yarn, [[H8504]] so that the breastpiece [[H2833]] was [[H1961]] above [[H5921]] the waistband [[H2805]] of the ephod [[H646]] and would not [[H3808]] come loose [[H2118]] from [[H5921]] the ephod, [[H646]] just as [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] had commanded [[H6680]] Moses. [[H4872]]

### 22

### 30
They also made [[H6213]] the plate [[H6731]] of the holy [[H6944]] crown [[H5145]] [of] pure [[H2889]] gold, [[H2091]] and they engraved [[H3789]] on it, [[H5921]] like an inscription [[H4385]] on a seal: [[H2368]] HOLY [[H6944]] TO THE LORD. [[H3068]]
