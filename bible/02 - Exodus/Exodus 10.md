### 1
Then the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] “Go [[H935]] to [[H413]] Pharaoh, [[H6547]] for [[H3588]] I [[H589]] have hardened [[H3513]] his heart [[H3820]] and the hearts [[H3820]] of his officials, [[H5650]] that [[H4616]] I may perform [[H7896]] these [[H428]] miraculous signs of Mine [[H226]] among them, [[H7130]]

### 2
and that [[H4616]] you may tell [[H5608]] your children [[H1121]] and grandchildren [[H1121]] how [[H834]] severely I dealt [[H5953]] with the Egyptians [[H4714]] when I performed [[H7760]] miraculous signs [[H226]] among them,  so that you may know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I [[H589]] am the LORD.” [[H3068]]

### 3
So Moses [[H4872]] and Aaron [[H175]] went [[H935]] to [[H413]] Pharaoh [[H6547]] and told [[H559]] him, [[H413]] “This is what [[H3541]] the LORD, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of the Hebrews, [[H5680]] says: [[H559]] ‘How long [[H5704]] will you refuse [[H3985]] to humble yourself [[H6031]] before Me? [[H6440]] Let My people [[H5971]] go, [[H7971]] so that they may worship Me. [[H5647]]

### 4
But [[H3588]] if [[H518]] you [[H859]] refuse [[H3986]] to let My people [[H5971]] go, [[H7971]] I will bring [[H935]] locusts [[H697]] into your territory [[H1366]] tomorrow. [[H4279]]

### 5
They will cover [[H3680]] the face [[H5869]] of the land [[H776]] so that no [[H3808]] one can [[H3201]] see [[H7200]] [it]. [[H776]] They will devour [[H398]] whatever is [[H3499]] left [[H7604]] after [[H6413]] the hail [[H1259]] and eat [[H398]] every [[H3605]] tree [[H6086]] that grows [[H6779]] in your  fields. [[H7704]]

### 6
They will fill [[H4390]] your houses [[H1004]] and the houses [[H1004]] of all [[H3605]] your officials [[H5650]] and [[H1004]] every [[H3605]] Egyptian— [[H4713]] something [[H834]] neither [[H3808]] your fathers [[H1]] nor your grandfathers [[H1]] have seen [[H7200]] since the day [[H3117]] they came into [[H1961]] this land.’” [[H127]] Then [Moses] turned [[H6437]] and left [[H3318]] Pharaoh’s presence. [[H6547]]

### 7
Pharaoh’s [[H6547]] officials [[H5650]] asked him, [[H559]] “How long [[H5704]] will this [[H2088]] man be [[H1961]] a snare to us? [[H4170]] Let the people [[H376]] go, [[H7971]] so that they may worship [[H5647]] the LORD [[H3068]] their God. [[H430]] Do you not yet realize [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] Egypt [[H4714]] is in ruins?” [[H6]]

### 8
So Moses [[H4872]] and Aaron [[H175]] were brought back [[H7725]] to [[H413]] Pharaoh. [[H6547]] “Go, [[H1980]] worship [[H5647]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God,” [[H430]] [he] said. [[H559]] “But who exactly [[H4310]] will be going?” [[H1980]]

### 9
“We will go [[H1980]] with our young [[H5288]] and old,” [[H2205]] Moses [[H4872]] replied. [[H559]] “We will go [[H1980]] with our sons [[H1121]] and daughters, [[H1323]] and with our flocks [[H6629]] and herds, [[H1241]] for [[H3588]] [we must hold] a feast [[H2282]] to the LORD.” [[H3068]]

### 10
Then [Pharaoh] [[H559]] told them, [[H413]] “May the LORD [[H3068]] be [[H1961]] with you [[H5973]] if I ever [[H834]] let you go [[H7971]] with your little ones. [[H2945]] Clearly [[H7200]] you are bent [[H5048]] on evil. [[H7451]]

### 11
No, [[H3808]] only the men [[H1397]] may go [[H1980]] and worship [[H5647]] the LORD, [[H3068]] since [[H3588]] that is what you [[H859]] have been requesting.” [[H1245]] And [Moses and Aaron] were driven [[H1644]] from [[H853]] Pharaoh’s [[H6547]] presence. [[H6440]]

### 12
Then the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] “Stretch out [[H5186]] your hand [[H3027]] over [[H5921]] the land [[H776]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] that the locusts [[H697]] may swarm [[H5927]] over [[H5921]] it [[H776]] and devour [[H398]] every [[H3605]] plant [[H6212]] in the land— [[H776]] everything [[H3605]] that [[H834]] the hail [[H1259]] has left behind.” [[H7604]]

### 13
So Moses [[H4872]] stretched out [[H5186]] his staff [[H4294]] over [[H5921]] the land [[H776]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] and throughout [[H3605]] that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] and night [[H3915]] the LORD [[H3068]] sent [[H5090]] an east [[H6921]] wind [[H7307]] across the land. [[H776]] By morning [[H1242]] the east [[H6921]] wind [[H7307]] had brought [[H5375]] the locusts. [[H697]]

### 14
The locusts [[H697]] swarmed [[H5927]] across [[H5921]] the land [[H776]] and settled [[H5117]] over the entire [[H3605]] territory [[H1366]] of Egypt. [[H4714]] Never [[H3808]] before [[H6440]] had there been [[H1961]] so [[H3651]] many [[H3515]] locusts, [[H697]] and never [[H3808]] again will there be. [[H1961]]

### 15
They covered [[H3680]] the face [[H5869]] of all [[H3605]] the land [[H776]] until [it] [[H776]] was black, [[H2821]] and they consumed [[H398]] all [[H3605]] the plants [[H6212]] on the ground [[H776]] and all [[H3605]] the fruit [[H6529]] on the trees [[H6086]] that [[H834]] the hail [[H1259]] had left behind. [[H3498]] Nothing [[H3808]] green [[H3418]] was left [[H3498]] on any tree [[H6086]] or plant [[H6212]] in all [[H3605]] the land [[H776]] of Egypt. [[H4714]]

### 16
Pharaoh [[H6547]] quickly [[H4116]] summoned [[H7121]] Moses [[H4872]] and Aaron [[H175]] and said, [[H559]] “I have sinned [[H2398]] against the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] and against you. 

### 17
Now [[H6258]] please [[H4994]] forgive [[H5375]] my sin [[H2403]] once more [[H389]] and appeal [[H6279]] to the LORD [[H3068]] your God, [[H430]] so that He will remove [[H5493]] this [[H2088]] death [[H4194]] from me.” [[H5921]]

### 18
So Moses left [[H3318]] Pharaoh’s [[H6547]] presence and appealed [[H6279]] to [[H413]] the LORD. [[H3068]]

### 19
And the LORD [[H3068]] changed the wind [[H2015]] to a very strong [[H2389]] west [[H3220]] wind [[H7307]] that carried off [[H5375]] the locusts [[H697]] and blew [[H8628]] them into the Red [[H5488]] Sea. [[H3220]] Not [[H3808]] a single [[H259]] locust [[H697]] remained [[H7604]] anywhere [[H3605]] in [[H1366]] Egypt. [[H4714]]

### 20
But the LORD [[H3068]] hardened [[H2388]] Pharaoh’s [[H6547]] heart, [[H3820]] and he would not [[H3808]] let the Israelites [[H1121]] go. [[H7971]]

### 21
Then the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] “Stretch out [[H5186]] your hand [[H3027]] toward [[H5921]] heaven, [[H8064]] so that darkness [[H2822]] will spread [[H1961]] over [[H5921]] the land [[H776]] of Egypt— [[H4714]] a palpable [[H4959]] darkness.” [[H2822]]

### 22
So Moses [[H4872]] stretched out [[H5186]] his hand [[H3027]] toward [[H5921]] heaven, [[H8064]] and total [[H653]] darkness [[H2822]] covered [[H1961]] all [[H3605]] the land [[H776]] of Egypt [[H4714]] for three [[H7969]] days. [[H3117]]

### 23
No [[H3808]] one [[H376]] could see [[H7200]] each other, [[H251]] and for three [[H7969]] days [[H3117]] no one [[H3808]] left [[H6965]] his place. [[H8478]] Yet all [[H3605]] the Israelites [[H1121]] had [[H1961]] light [[H216]] in their dwellings. [[H4186]]

### 24
Then Pharaoh [[H6547]] summoned [[H7121]] Moses [[H4872]] and said, [[H559]] “Go, [[H1980]] worship [[H5647]] the LORD. [[H3068]] Even [[H1571]] your little ones [[H2945]] may go [[H1980]] with you; [[H5973]] only [[H7535]] your flocks [[H6629]] and herds [[H1241]] must stay behind.” [[H3322]]

### 25
But Moses [[H4872]] replied, [[H559]] “You [[H859]] must also [[H1571]] provide [[H5414]] us with [[H3027]] sacrifices [[H2077]] and burnt offerings [[H5930]] to present [[H6213]] to the LORD [[H3068]] our God. [[H430]]

### 26
Even [[H1571]] our livestock [[H4735]] must go [[H1980]] with us; [[H5973]] not [[H3808]] a hoof [[H6541]] will be left behind, [[H7604]] for [[H3588]] we will need [[H3947]] some of [[H4480]] them to worship [[H5647]] the LORD [[H3068]] our God, [[H430]] and we will [[H587]] not [[H3808]] know [[H3045]] how [[H4100]] we are to worship [[H5647]] the LORD [[H3068]] until [[H5704]] we arrive.” [[H935]]

### 27
But the LORD [[H3068]] hardened [[H2388]] Pharaoh’s [[H6547]] heart, [[H3820]] and he was not willing [[H3808]] to let them go. [[H7971]]

### 28
“Depart [[H1980]] from me!” [[H5921]] Pharaoh [[H6547]] said to [Moses]. [[H559]] “Make sure [[H8104]] you never [[H408]] see [[H7200]] my face [[H6440]] again, [[H3254]] for [[H3588]] on the day [[H3117]] you see [[H7200]] my face, [[H6440]] you will die.” [[H4191]]

### 29
“As [[H3651]] you say,” [[H1696]] Moses [[H4872]] replied, [[H559]] “I will never [[H3808]] see [[H7200]] your face [[H6440]] again.” [[H3254]]
