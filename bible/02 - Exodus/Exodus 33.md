### 1
Then the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H1696]] to [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] “Leave [[H5927]] this place, [[H2088]] you [[H859]] and the people [[H5971]] you brought up [[H5927]] out of the land [[H776]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] [and] go [[H1980]] to [[H413]] the land [[H776]] I promised [[H7650]] to Abraham, [[H85]] Isaac, [[H3327]] and Jacob [[H3290]] when I said, [[H559]] I will give it [[H5414]] to your descendants. [[H2233]]

### 2
And I will send [[H7971]] an angel [[H4397]] before you [[H6440]] and drive out [[H1644]] the Canaanites, [[H3669]] Amorites, [[H567]] Hittites, [[H2850]] Perizzites, [[H6522]] Hivites, [[H2340]] and Jebusites. [[H2983]]

### 3
Go up to [[H413]] a land [[H776]] flowing [[H2100]] with milk [[H2461]] and honey. [[H1706]] But [[H3588]] I will not [[H3808]] go [[H5927]] with you, [[H7130]] because [[H3588]] you [[H859]] are a stiff-necked [[H7186]] people; [[H5971]] otherwise, [[H6435]] I might destroy [[H3615]] you on the way.” [[H1870]]

### 4
When the people [[H5971]] heard [[H8085]] these [[H2088]] bad [[H7451]] tidings, [[H1697]] they went into mourning, [[H56]] and no [[H3808]] one [[H376]] put on [[H7896]] any of his jewelry. [[H5716]]

### 5
For the LORD [[H3068]] had said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] “Tell [[H559]] the Israelites, [[H1121]] ‘You [[H859]] are a stiff-necked [[H7186]] people. [[H5971]] If I should go [[H5927]] with you [[H7130]] for a single [[H259]] moment, [[H7281]] I would destroy you. [[H3615]] Now [[H6258]] take off [[H3381]] your jewelry, [[H5716]] and I will decide [[H3045]] what [[H4100]] to do [[H6213]] with you. 

### 6
So the Israelites [[H1121]] remained stripped [[H5337]] of their jewelry [[H5716]] from Mount [[H2022]] Horeb [onward]. [[H2722]]

### 7
Now Moses [[H4872]] used to take [[H3947]] the tent [[H168]] and pitch [[H5186]] it  at a distance [[H7368]] outside [[H4480]] the camp. [[H4264]] He called [[H7121]] it the Tent [[H168]] of Meeting, [[H4150]] and [[H1961]] anyone [[H3605]] inquiring of [[H1245]] the LORD [[H3068]] would go [[H3318]] to [[H413]] the Tent [[H168]] of Meeting [[H4150]] outside [[H2351]] the camp. [[H4264]]

### 8
Then, [[H1961]] whenever Moses [[H4872]] went out [[H3318]] to [[H413]] the tent, [[H168]] all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] would stand [[H6965]] at the entrances [[H6607]] of their tents [[H168]] and watch [[H5027]] Moses [[H4872]] until [[H5704]] he entered [[H935]] the tent. [[H168]]

### 9
As [[H1961]] Moses [[H4872]] entered [[H935]] the tent, [[H168]] the pillar [[H5982]] of cloud [[H6051]] would come down [[H3381]] and remain [[H5975]] at the entrance, [[H6607]] and the LORD would speak [[H1696]] with [[H5973]] Moses. [[H4872]]

### 10
When all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] saw [[H7200]] the pillar [[H5982]] of cloud [[H6051]] standing [[H5975]] at the entrance [[H6607]] to the tent, [[H168]] they [[H3605]] would stand up [[H6965]] and worship, [[H7812]] each one [[H376]] at the entrance [[H6607]] to his tent. [[H168]]

### 11
Thus the LORD [[H3068]] would speak [[H1696]] to [[H413]] Moses [[H4872]] face [[H6440]] to [[H413]] face, [[H6440]] as [[H834]] a man [[H376]] speaks [[H1696]] with [[H413]] his friend. [[H7453]] Then Moses would return [[H7725]] to [[H413]] the camp, [[H4264]] but his young [[H5288]] assistant [[H8334]] Joshua [[H3091]] son [[H1121]] of Nun [[H5126]] would not [[H3808]] leave [[H4185]] the tent. [[H168]]

### 12
Moses [[H4872]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] the LORD, [[H3068]] “Look, [[H7200]] You [[H859]] have been telling me, [[H559]] ‘Lead [[H5927]] this [[H2088]] people up,’ [[H5971]] but You [[H859]] have not [[H3808]] let me know [[H3045]] whom [[H834]] You will send [[H7971]] with me. [[H5973]] Yet You [[H859]] have said, [[H559]] ‘I know [[H3045]] you by name, [[H8034]] and you have [[H1571]] found [[H4672]] favor [[H2580]] in My sight.’ [[H5869]]

### 13
Now [[H6258]] if [[H518]] indeed [[H4994]] I have found [[H4672]] favor [[H2580]] in Your sight, [[H5869]] please [[H4994]] let me know [[H3045]] Your ways, [[H1870]] that I may know You [[H3045]] and find [[H4672]] favor [[H2580]] in Your sight. [[H5869]] Remember [[H7200]] that [[H3588]] this [[H2088]] nation [[H1471]] is Your people.” [[H5971]]

### 14
And [the LORD] answered, [[H559]] “My presence [[H6440]] will go [with you], [[H1980]] and I will give you rest.” [[H5117]]

### 15
“If [[H518]] Your presence [[H6440]] does not [[H369]] go [with us],” [[H1980]] Moses replied, [[H559]] “do not [[H408]] lead us up [[H5927]] from here. [[H2088]]

### 16
For how then [[H4100]] can it be known [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] Your people [[H5971]] and I [[H589]] have found [[H4672]] favor [[H2580]] in Your sight, [[H5869]] unless [[H3808]] You go [[H1980]] with us? [[H5973]] [How else will] we [[H589]] be distinguished [[H6395]] from all [[H3605]] the other people [[H5971]] on [[H5921]] the face [[H6440]] of the earth?” [[H127]]

### 17
And the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] “I will do [[H6213]] this [[H2088]] very [[H1571]] thing [[H1697]] you have asked, [[H1696]] for [[H3588]] you have found [[H4672]] favor [[H2580]] in My sight, [[H5869]] and I know [[H3045]] you by name.” [[H8034]]

### 18
Then Moses said, [[H559]] “Please [[H4994]] show [[H7200]] me Your glory.” [[H3519]]

### 19
“I [[H589]] will cause all [[H3605]] My goodness [[H2898]] to pass [[H5674]] in [[H5921]] front of you,” [[H6440]] [the LORD] replied, [[H559]] “and I will proclaim [[H7121]] [My] name— [[H8034]] the LORD— [[H3068]] before you. [[H6440]] I will have mercy [[H2603]] on whom [[H834]] I have mercy, [[H2603]] and I will have compassion [[H7355]] on whom [[H834]] I have compassion.” [[H7355]]

### 20
And He added, [[H559]] “You cannot [[H3808]] see [[H7200]] My face, [[H6440]] for [[H3588]] no [[H3808]] one [[H120]] can see [Me] [[H7200]] and live.” [[H2425]]

### 21
The LORD [[H3068]] continued, [[H559]] “There [[H2009]] is a place [[H4725]] near Me [[H853]] where you are to stand [[H5324]] upon [[H5921]] a rock, [[H6697]]

### 22
and when [[H1961]] My glory [[H3519]] passes by, [[H5674]] I will put you [[H7760]] in a cleft [[H5366]] of the rock [[H6697]] and cover you [[H5526]] with My hand [[H3709]] until [[H5704]] I have passed by. [[H5674]]

### 23
Then I will take My hand [[H3709]] away, [[H5493]] and you will see [[H7200]] My back; [[H268]] but My face [[H6440]] must not [[H3808]] be seen.” [[H7200]]
