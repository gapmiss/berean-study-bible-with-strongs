### 20
Then the entire [[H3605]] congregation [[H5712]] of the Israelites [[H3478]] withdrew [[H3318]] from the presence [[H6440]] of Moses. [[H4872]]

### 21
And everyone [[H3605]] whose [[H834]] heart [[H3820]] stirred him [[H5375]] and [[H3605]] whose [[H834]] spirit [[H7307]] prompted [[H5068]] him [[H853]] came [[H935]] and brought [[H935]] an offering [[H8641]] to the LORD [[H3068]] for the work [[H4399]] on the Tent [[H168]] of Meeting, [[H4150]] for all [[H3605]] its services, [[H5656]] and for the sacred [[H6944]] garments.

The leaders [[H5387]] brought [[H935]] onyx [[H7718]] stones [[H68]] and gemstones [[H68]] to mount [[H4394]] on the ephod [[H646]] and breastpiece, [[H2833]]

### 28
as well as spices [[H1314]] and olive oil [[H8081]] for the light, [[H3974]] for the anointing [[H4888]] oil, [[H8081]] and for the fragrant [[H5561]] incense. [[H7004]]

### 29
So all [[H3605]] the men [[H376]] and women [[H802]] of the Israelites [[H1121]] whose [[H834]] hearts [[H3820]] prompted [[H5068]] them [[H853]] brought [[H935]] a freewill offering [[H5071]] to the LORD [[H3068]] for all [[H3605]] the work [[H4399]] that [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] through [[H3027]] Moses [[H4872]] had commanded [[H6680]] them to do. [[H6213]]

### 30
Then Moses [[H4872]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] the Israelites, [[H1121]] “See, [[H7200]] the LORD [[H3068]] has called [[H7121]] by name [[H8034]] Bezalel [[H1212]] son [[H1121]] of Uri, [[H221]] the son [[H1121]] of Hur, [[H2354]] of the tribe [[H4294]] of Judah. [[H3063]]

### 31
And He has filled [[H4390]] him [[H853]] with the Spirit [[H7307]] of God, [[H430]] with wisdom, [[H2451]] understanding, [[H1847]] and ability [[H8394]] in all kinds [[H3605]] of crafts, [[H4399]]
