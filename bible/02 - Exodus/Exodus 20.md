### 1
And God [[H430]] spoke [[H1696]] all [[H3605]] these [[H428]] words: [[H1697]]

### 2
“I [[H595]] am the LORD [[H3068]] your God, [[H430]] who [[H834]] brought you out [[H3318]] of the land [[H776]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] out of the house [[H1004]] of slavery. [[H5650]]

### 3
You  shall have [[H1961]] no [[H3808]] other [[H312]] gods [[H430]] before [[H5921]] Me. [[H6440]]

### 4
{You shall} not [[H3808]] make [[H6213]] for yourself  an idol [[H6459]] of any kind, [[H3605]] or an image [[H8544]] of anything [[H834]] in the heavens [[H8064]] above, [[H4605]] the earth [[H776]] below, [[H8478]] or the waters [[H4325]] under [[H8478]] the earth. [[H776]]

### 5
You shall not [[H3808]] bow down [[H7812]] to them  or [[H3808]] worship them; [[H5647]] for [[H3588]] I, [[H595]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God, [[H430]] am a jealous [[H7067]] God, [[H410]] visiting [[H6485]] the iniquity [[H5771]] of the fathers [[H1]] on [[H5921]] [their] children [[H1121]] to [[H5921]] the third [[H8029]] and fourth [generations] [[H7256]] of those who hate Me, [[H8130]]

### 6
but showing [[H6213]] loving devotion [[H2617]] to a thousand [generations] [[H505]] of those who love [[H157]] Me and keep [[H8104]] My commandments. [[H4687]]

### 7
You {shall} not [[H3808]] take [[H5375]] the name [[H8034]] of the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] in vain, [[H7723]] for [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] will not [[H3808]] leave anyone unpunished [[H5352]] who [[H834]] takes [[H5375]] His name [[H8034]] in vain. [[H7723]]

### 8
Remember [[H2142]] the Sabbath [[H7676]] day [[H3117]] by keeping it holy. [[H6942]]

### 9
Six [[H8337]] days [[H3117]] you shall labor [[H5647]] and do [[H6213]] all [[H3605]] your work, [[H4399]]

### 10
but the seventh [[H7637]] day [[H3117]] is a Sabbath [[H7676]] to the LORD [[H3068]] your God, [[H430]] on which you must not [[H3808]] do [[H6213]] any [[H3605]] work— [[H4399]] neither you, [[H859]] nor your son [[H1121]] or daughter, [[H1323]] nor your manservant [[H5650]] or maidservant [[H519]] or livestock, [[H929]] nor the foreigner [[H1616]] within [[H834]] your gates. [[H8179]]

### 11
For [[H3588]] [in] six [[H8337]] days [[H3117]] the LORD [[H3068]] made [[H6213]] the heavens [[H8064]] and the earth [[H776]] and the sea [[H3220]] and [[H853]] all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] [is] in them,  but on the seventh [[H7637]] day [[H3117]] He rested. [[H5117]] Therefore [[H5921]] the LORD [[H3068]] blessed [[H1288]] the Sabbath [[H7676]] day [[H3117]] and set it apart as holy. [[H6942]]

### 12
Honor [[H3513]] your father [[H1]] and mother, [[H517]] so that [[H4616]] your days [[H3117]] may be long [[H748]] in [[H5921]] the land [[H127]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] is giving [[H5414]] you. 

### 13
You shall not [[HThou shalt not kill.]] murder. [[H3808]] [[H7523]]

### 14
You shall not [[HThou shalt not commit adultery.]] commit adultery. [[H3808]] [[H5003]]

### 15
You shall not [[HThou shalt not steal.]] steal. [[H3808]] [[H1589]]

### 16
You shall not [[H3808]] bear [[H6030]] FALSE [[H8267]] witness [[H5707]] against your neighbor. [[H7453]]

### 17
You shall not [[H3808]] covet [[H2530]] your neighbor’s [[H7453]] house. [[H1004]] You shall not [[H3808]] covet [[H2530]] your neighbor’s [[H7453]] wife, [[H802]] or his manservant [[H5650]] or maidservant, [[H519]] or his ox [[H7794]] or donkey, [[H2543]] or anything [[H3605]] that [[H834]] belongs to your neighbor. [[H7453]]

### 18
All [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] witnessed [[H7200]] the thunder [[H6963]] and lightning, [[H3940]] the sound [[H6963]] of the trumpet, [[H7782]] and the mountain [[H2022]] in smoke. [[H6226]] And when the people [[H5971]] saw [this], [[H7200]] they trembled [[H5128]] and stood [[H5975]] at a distance. [[H7350]]

### 19
“Speak [[H1696]] to us [[H5973]] yourself [[H859]] and we will listen,” [[H8085]] they said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Moses. [[H4872]] “But do not [[H408]] let God [[H430]] speak [[H1696]] to us, [[H5973]] or [[H6435]] we will die.” [[H4191]]

### 20
“Do not [[H408]] be afraid,” [[H3372]] Moses [[H4872]] replied. [[H559]] “For [[H3588]] God [[H430]] has come [[H935]] to [[H5668]] test you, [[H5254]] so that [[H5668]] the fear of Him [[H3374]] may be before [[H5921]] you, [[H6440]] to keep [[H1115]] you from sinning.” [[H2398]]

### 21
And the people [[H5971]] stood [[H5975]] at a distance [[H7350]] as Moses [[H4872]] approached [[H5066]] the thick darkness [[H6205]] where [[H834]] God was. [[H430]]

### 22
Then the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] “This is what [[H3541]] you are to tell [[H559]] the Israelites: [[H1121]] ‘You [[H859]] have seen for yourselves [[H7200]] that [[H3588]] I have spoken [[H1696]] to [[H5973]] you from [[H4480]] heaven. [[H8064]]

### 23
You are not [[H3808]] to make [[H6213]] any gods [[H430]] to rival Me; [[H854]] you are not [[H3808]] to make [[H6213]] for yourselves  gods [[H430]] of silver [[H3701]] or gold. [[H2091]]

### 24
You are to make [[H6213]] for Me  an altar [[H4196]] of earth, [[H127]] and sacrifice [[H2076]] on it [[H5921]] your burnt offerings [[H5930]] and peace offerings, [[H8002]] your sheep and goats [[H6629]] and cattle. [[H1241]] In every [[H3605]] place [[H4725]] where [[H834]] I cause My name [[H8034]] to be remembered, [[H2142]] I will come [[H935]] to you [[H413]] and bless you. [[H1288]]

### 25
Now if [[H518]] you make [[H6213]] an altar [[H4196]] of stones [[H68]] for Me,  you must not [[H3808]] build [[H1129]] it [[H853]] with stones shaped by tools; [[H1496]] for if [[H3588]] you use [[H5130]] a chisel [[H2719]] on it, [[H5921]] you will defile it. [[H2490]]

### 26
And you must not [[H3808]] go up [[H5927]] to My altar [[H4196]] on steps, [[H4609]] lest [[H834]] your nakedness [[H6172]] be exposed [[H1540]] on it.’ [[H5921]]
