### 1
Then the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] “I will bring [[H935]] upon [[H5921]] Pharaoh [[H6547]] and [[H5921]] Egypt [[H4714]] one [[H259]] more [[H5750]] plague. [[H5061]] After [[H310]] that, [[H3651]] he will allow you to leave [[H7971]] this place. [[H2088]] And when he lets you go, [[H7971]] he will drive you out [[H1644]] completely. [[H3617]]

### 2
Now [[H4994]] announce [[H1696]] to the people [[H5971]] that men [[H376]] and women alike [[H802]] should ask their neighbors [[H7468]] for [[H7592]] articles [[H3627]] of silver [[H3701]] and gold.” [[H2091]]

### 3
And the LORD [[H3068]] gave [[H5414]] the people [[H5971]] favor [[H2580]] in the sight [[H5869]] of the Egyptians. [[H4714]] Moreover, [[H1571]] Moses [[H4872]] himself [[H376]] was highly [[H3966]] regarded [[H1419]] in Egypt [[H776]] by [[H5869]] Pharaoh’s [[H6547]] officials [[H5650]] and by the people. [[H5971]]

### 4
So Moses [[H4872]] declared, [[H559]] “This is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] says: [[H559]] ‘About midnight [[H2676]] I [[H589]] will go [[H3318]] throughout [[H8432]] Egypt, [[H4714]]

### 5
and every [[H3605]] firstborn son [[H1060]] in the land [[H776]] of Egypt [[H4714]] will die, [[H4191]] from the firstborn [[H1060]] of Pharaoh [[H6547]] who sits [[H3427]] on [[H5921]] his throne, [[H3678]] to [[H5704]] the firstborn [[H1060]] of the servant girl [[H8198]] behind [[H310]] the hand mill, [[H7347]] as well as the firstborn [[H1060]] of all [[H3605]] the cattle. [[H929]]

### 6
Then a great [[H1419]] cry [[H6818]] will go out [[H1961]] over all [[H3605]] the land [[H776]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] such as [[H3644]] never [[H3808]] has been heard before, [[H1961]] [and never] [[H3808]] will be [heard] again. [[H3254]]

### 7
But among all [[H3605]] the Israelites, [[H1121]] not [[H3808]] even a dog [[H3611]] will snarl [[H2782]] at man [[H376]] or beast.’ [[H929]] Then [[H4616]] you will know [[H3045]] that [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] makes a distinction [[H6395]] between [[H996]] Egypt [[H4714]] and Israel. [[H3478]]

### 8
All [[H3605]] these [[H428]] officials [[H5650]] of yours will come [[H3381]] and bow before me, [[H7812]] saying, [[H559]] ‘Go, [[H3318]] you [[H859]] and all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] who [[H834]] follow you!’ [[H7272]] After [[H310]] that, [[H3651]] I will depart.” [[H3318]] And hot [[H2750]] with anger, [[H639]] [Moses] left [[H3318]] Pharaoh’s [[H6547]] presence. [[H5973]]

### 9
The LORD [[H3068]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] “Pharaoh [[H6547]] will not [[H3808]] listen [[H8085]] to you, [[H413]] so that [[H4616]] My wonders [[H4159]] may be multiplied [[H7235]] in the land [[H776]] of Egypt.” [[H4714]]

### 10
Moses [[H4872]] and Aaron [[H175]] did [[H6213]] all [[H3605]] these [[H428]] wonders [[H4159]] before [[H6440]] Pharaoh, [[H6547]] but the LORD [[H3068]] hardened [[H2388]] Pharaoh’s [[H6547]] heart [[H3820]] so that he would not [[H3808]] let the Israelites [[H1121]] go out [[H7971]] of his land.
