###### 2
He overlaid [[H6823]] it with pure [[H2889]] gold, [[H2091]] both inside [[H1004]] and out, [[H2351]] and made [[H6213]] a gold [[H2091]] molding [[H2213]] all around it. [[H5439]]

###### 3
And he cast [[H3332]] four [[H702]] gold [[H2091]] rings [[H2885]] for [[H5921]] its four [[H702]] feet, [[H6471]] two [[H8147]] on [[H5921]] one [[H259]] side [[H6763]] and two [[H8147]] on [[H5921]] the other. [[H8145]]

###### 4
Then he made [[H6213]] poles [[H905]] of acacia [[H7848]] wood [[H6086]] and overlaid [[H6823]] them with gold. [[H2091]]

###### 5
He inserted [[H935]] the poles [[H905]] into the rings [[H2885]] on [[H5921]] the sides [[H6763]] of the ark [[H727]] for carrying [[H5375]] [it]. [[H727]]

###### 6

one [[H259]] cherub [[H3742]] on [[H4480]] one [[H2088]] end [[H7098]] of the mercy seat [[H3727]] and one [[H259]] on the other, [[H2088]] [all] made [[H6213]] from one piece. [[H7118]]

And the cherubim [[H3742]] had wings [[H3671]] that spread [[H6566]] upward. [[H4605]] They faced [[H6440]] each [[H376]] other [[H251]] and overshadowed [[H5526]] the mercy seat [[H3727]] with their wings, [[H3671]] their faces [[H6440]] looking toward [[H413]] the mercy seat. [[H3727]]

###### 10

###### 12
He also made [[H6213]] a rim [[H4526]] around [[H5439]] it  a handbreadth wide [[H2948]] and put [[H6213]] a gold [[H2091]] molding [[H2213]] on [[H5439]] the rim. [[H4526]]

###### 14
The rings [[H2885]] were placed [[H1961]] next to [[H5980]] the frame [[H4526]] as holders [[H1004]] for the poles [[H905]] used to carry [[H5375]] the table. [[H7979]]

Six [[H8337]] branches [[H7070]] extended [[H3318]] from the sides, [[H6654]] three [[H7969]] on one [[H259]] side [[H6654]] and three [[H7969]] on the other. [[H8145]]

###### 19
