### 1
Bezalel constructed [[H6213]] the altar [[H4196]] of burnt offering [[H5930]] from acacia [[H7848]] wood. [[H6086]] It was square, [[H7251]] five [[H2568]] cubits [[H520]] long, [[H753]] five [[H2568]] cubits [[H520]] wide, [[H7341]] and three [[H7969]] cubits [[H520]] high. [[H6967]]

### 2
He made [[H6213]] a horn [[H7161]] at each of [[H5921]] its four [[H702]] corners, [[H6438]] so that the horns [and altar] [[H7161]] were [[H1961]] of one piece, [[H4480]] and he overlaid [[H6823]] [the altar] with bronze. [[H5178]]

### 3
He made [[H6213]] all [[H3605]] the altar’s [[H4196]] utensils [[H3627]] of bronze— [[H5178]] its pots, [[H5518]] shovels, [[H3257]] basins, [[H4219]] meat forks, [[H4207]] and firepans. [[H4289]]

### 4
He made [[H6213]] a grate [[H4345]] of bronze [[H5178]] mesh [[H7568]] for the altar [[H4196]] under [[H8478]] its ledge, [[H3749]] halfway [[H2677]] up from the bottom. [[H4295]]

### 5
At the four [[H702]] corners [[H7099]] of the bronze [[H5178]] grate [[H4345]] he cast [[H3332]] four [[H702]] rings [[H2885]] as holders [[H1004]] for the poles. [[H905]]

### 6
And he made [[H6213]] the poles [[H905]] of acacia [[H7848]] wood [[H6086]] and overlaid [[H6823]] them with bronze. [[H5178]]

### 7
Then he inserted [[H935]] the poles [[H905]] into the rings [[H2885]] on [[H5921]] the sides [[H6763]] of the altar [[H4196]] for carrying [[H5375]] it. [[H853]] He made [[H6213]] [the altar] [[H853]] with boards [[H3871]] so that it was hollow. [[H5014]]

### 8
Next, he made [[H6213]] the bronze [[H5178]] basin [[H3595]] and its stand [[H3653]] from the mirrors [[H4759]] of the women who [[H834]] served [[H6633]] at the entrance [[H6607]] to the Tent [[H168]] of Meeting. [[H4150]]

### 9
Then he constructed [[H6213]] the courtyard. [[H2691]] The south [[H5045]] side [[H6285]] of the courtyard [[H2691]] was a hundred [[H3967]] cubits [long] [[H520]] [and had] curtains [[H7050]] of finely spun [[H7806]] linen, [[H8336]]

### 13
And the east [[H6924]] side, [[H6285]] toward the sunrise, [[H4217]] [was also] fifty [[H2572]] cubits [long]. [[H520]]

The curtains [[H7050]] of [[H413]] the one side [[H3802]] [of the entrance were] fifteen [[H2568]] cubits [long], [[H520]] with three [[H7969]] posts [[H5982]] and three [[H7969]] bases. [[H134]]

### 16
All [[H3605]] the curtains [[H7050]] around [[H5439]] the courtyard [[H2691]] were made of finely spun [[H7806]] linen. [[H8336]]
