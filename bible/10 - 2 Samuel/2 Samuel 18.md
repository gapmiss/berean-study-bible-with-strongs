### 1
Then David [[H1732]] reviewed [[H6485]] his troops [[H5971]] and appointed [[H7760]] over them [[H5921]] commanders [[H8269]] of hundreds [[H3967]] and of thousands. [[H505]]

### 2
He [[H1732]] sent out [[H7971]] the troops, [[H5971]] a third [[H7992]] under Joab, [[H3097]] a third [[H7992]] under Joab’s [[H3097]] brother [[H251]] Abishai [[H52]] son [[H1121]] of Zeruiah, [[H6870]] and a third [[H7992]] under Ittai [[H863]] the Gittite. [[H1663]] And the king [[H4428]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] the troops, [[H5971]] “I [[H589]] will surely march out [[H3318]] with you [[H5973]] as well. [[H1571]]

### 3
But the people [[H5971]] pleaded, [[H559]] “You must not [[H3808]] go out! [[H3318]] For [[H3588]] if [[H518]] we have to flee, [[H5127]] they will pay no attention [[H7760]] to us. [[H413]] Even if [[H518]] half of us [[H2677]] die, [[H4191]] they will not [[H3808]] care; [[H7760]] but [[H3588]] you are worth [[H3644]] ten [[H6235]] thousand of us. [[H505]] It is better [[H2896]] for now [[H6258]] if you support [[H5826]] us  from the city. [[H5892]]

### 4
“I will do [[H6213]] whatever [[H834]] seems best [[H3190]] to you,” [[H5869]] the king [[H4428]] replied. [[H559]] So he [[H4428]] stood [[H5975]] beside [[H413]] the gate, [[H8179]] while all [[H3605]] the troops [[H5971]] marched out [[H3381]] by hundreds [[H3967]] and thousands. [[H505]]

### 5
Now the king [[H4428]] had commanded [[H6680]] Joab, [[H3097]] Abishai, [[H52]] and Ittai, [[H863]] “Treat the young man [[H5288]] Absalom [[H53]] gently [[H328]] for my sake.”  And all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] heard [[H8085]] the king’s [[H4428]] orders [[H6680]] to each [[H3605]] of the commanders [[H8269]] regarding [[H5921]] Absalom. [[H53]]

### 6
So David’s army [[H5971]] marched [[H3318]] into the field [[H7704]] to engage [[H7125]] Israel [[H3478]] in the battle, [[H4421]] which took place [[H1961]] in the forest [[H3293]] of Ephraim. [[H669]]

### 7
There [[H8033]] the people [[H5971]] of Israel [[H3478]] were defeated [[H5062]] by [[H6440]] David’s [[H1732]] servants, [[H5650]] and the slaughter [[H4046]] was [[H1961]] great [[H1419]] that [[H1931]] day— [[H3117]] twenty [[H6242]] thousand [men]. [[H505]]

### 8
The battle [[H4421]] spread [[H6327]] over [[H5921]] the whole [[H3605]] countryside, [[H776]] and that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] the forest [[H3293]] devoured [[H398]] more [[H7235]] people [[H5971]] than [[H834]] the sword. [[H2719]]

### 9
Now Absalom [[H53]] was riding [[H7392]] on [[H5921]] his mule [[H6505]] when he [[H53]] met [[H7122]] the servants [[H5650]] of David, [[H1732]] and as the mule [[H6505]] went [[H935]] under [[H8478]] the tangled branches [[H7730]] of a large [[H1419]] oak, [[H424]] Absalom’s head [[H7218]] was caught fast [[H2388]] in the tree. [[H424]] The mule [[H6505]] under him [[H8478]] kept going, [[H5674]] so that he was suspended [[H5414]] in midair. [[H996]]

### 10
When one [[H259]] of the men [[H376]] saw this, [[H7200]] he told [[H5046]] Joab, [[H3097]] “I just [[H2009]] saw [[H7200]] Absalom [[H53]] hanging [[H8518]] in an oak tree!” [[H424]]

### 11
“You just [[H2009]] saw him!” [[H7200]] Joab [[H3097]] exclaimed. [[H559]] “Why [[H4069]] did you not [[H3808]] strike him [[H5221]] to the ground [[H776]] right there? [[H8033]] I would have given [[H5414]] you  ten [shekels] [[H6235]] of silver [[H3701]] and a [[H259]] warrior's belt!” [[H2290]]

### 12
The man [[H376]] replied, [[H559]] “Even if [[H3863]] a thousand [shekels] [[H505]] of silver [[H3701]] were weighed out [[H8254]] into [[H5921]] my hands, [[H3709]] I would not [[H3808]] raise [[H7971]] my hand [[H3027]] against [[H413]] the king’s [[H4428]] son. [[H1121]] For [[H3588]] we heard [[H241]] the king [[H4428]] command you [[H6680]] and Abishai [[H52]] and Ittai, [[H863]] ‘Protect [[H8104]] the young man [[H5288]] Absalom [[H53]] for my sake.’ [[H4310]]

### 13
If [[H176]] I had jeopardized [[H6213]] my own life— [[H5315]] and nothing [[H3808]] is hidden [[H3582]] from [[H4480]] the king— [[H4428]] you [[H859]] would have abandoned [[H3320]] me.” [[H5048]]

### 14
But Joab [[H3097]] declared, [[H559]] “I am not [[H3808]] going to wait [[H3176]] like this [[H3651]] with you!” [[H6440]] And he took [[H3947]] three [[H7969]] spears [[H7626]] in his hand [[H3709]] and thrust them [[H8628]] through the heart [[H3820]] of Absalom [[H53]] while he was still [[H5750]] alive [[H2416]] in the oak tree. [[H424]]

### 15
And ten [[H6235]] young men [[H5288]] who carried [[H5375]] Joab's [[H3097]] armor [[H3627]] surrounded [[H5437]] Absalom, [[H53]] struck [[H5221]] him, [[H853]] and killed him. [[H4191]]

### 16
Then Joab [[H3097]] blew [[H8628]] the trumpet, [[H7782]] and the troops [[H5971]] broke off [[H7725]] their pursuit [[H7291]] of Israel [[H3478]] because [[H3588]] Joab [[H3097]] had restrained them. [[H2820]]

### 17
They took [[H3947]] Absalom, [[H53]] cast [[H7993]] him into [[H413]] a large [[H1419]] pit [[H6354]] in the forest, [[H3293]] and piled [[H5324]] a huge [[H1419]] mound [[H1530]] of stones [[H68]] over him. [[H5921]] Meanwhile, all [[H3605]] the Israelites [[H3478]] fled, [[H5127]] each [[H376]] to his home. [[H168]]

### 18
During his lifetime, [[H2416]] Absalom [[H53]] had set up [[H5324]] for himself  a pillar [[H4678]] in the King’s [[H4428]] Valley, [[H6010]] for [[H3588]] he had said, [[H559]] “I have no [[H369]] son [[H1121]] to [[H5668]] preserve the memory [[H2142]] of my name.” [[H8034]] So he gave [[H7121]] the pillar [[H4678]] his name, [[H8034]] and to this [[H2088]] day [[H3117]] it is called [[H7121]] Absalom's [[H53]] Monument. [[H3027]]

### 19
Then Ahimaaz [[H290]] son [[H1121]] of Zadok [[H6659]] said, [[H559]] “Please [[H4994]] let me run [[H7323]] and tell the king [[H4428]] the good news [[H1319]] that [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] has avenged him [[H8199]] of [[H3027]] his enemies.” [[H341]]

### 20
But Joab [[H3097]] replied, [[H559]] “You [[H859]] are not [[H3808]] the man [[H376]] to take good news [[H1309]] today. [[H3117]] You may do [[H1319]] it another [[H312]] day, [[H3117]] but you must not [[H3808]] [do so] [[H1319]] today, [[H3117]] because [[H3588]] the king’s [[H4428]] son [[H1121]] is dead.” [[H4191]]

### 21
So Joab [[H3097]] said [[H559]] to a Cushite, [[H3569]] “Go, [[H1980]] tell [[H5046]] the king [[H4428]] what [[H834]] you have seen.” [[H7200]] The Cushite [[H3569]] bowed [[H7812]] to Joab [[H3097]] and took off running. [[H7323]]

### 22
Ahimaaz [[H290]] son [[H1121]] of Zadok, [[H6659]] however, persisted [[H3254]] and said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Joab, [[H3097]] “Regardless of whatever may happen, [[H4100]] please [[H4994]] let me [[H589]] also [[H1571]] run [[H7323]] behind [[H310]] the Cushite!” [[H3569]] “My son,” [[H1121]] Joab [[H3097]] replied, [[H559]] “why [[H4100]] do you [[H859]] want to run, [[H7323]] since you will not [[H369]] receive [[H4672]] a reward?” [[H1309]]

### 23
“No matter what, [[H4100]] I want to run!” [[H7323]] he replied. [[H1961]] “Then run!” [[H7323]] Joab told [[H559]] him.  So Ahimaaz [[H290]] ran [[H7323]] by way [[H1870]] of the plain [[H3603]] and outran [[H5674]] the Cushite. [[H3569]]

### 24
Now David [[H1732]] was sitting [[H3427]] between [[H996]] the two [[H8147]] gates [[H8179]] when the watchman [[H6822]] went up [[H1980]] to [[H413]] the roof [[H1406]] of the gateway [[H8179]] by [[H413]] the wall, [[H2346]] looked out, [[H5375]] and saw [[H7200]] a man [[H376]] running alone. [[H7323]]

### 25
So [he] [[H6822]] called out [[H7121]] and told [[H5046]] the king. [[H4428]] “If he is alone,” [[H518]] the king [[H4428]] replied, [[H559]] “he bears [[H6310]] good news.” [[H1309]] As the first runner drew [[H1980]] near, [[H7131]]

### 26
the watchman [[H6822]] saw [[H7200]] another [[H312]] man [[H376]] running, [[H7323]] and he called out [[H7121]] to [[H413]] the gatekeeper, [[H7778]] “Look! [[H2009]] Another man [[H376]] is running alone!” [[H7323]] “This [one] [[H2088]] also [[H1571]] brings news,” [[H1319]] said [[H559]] the king. [[H4428]]

### 27
The watchman [[H6822]] said, [[H559]] “The first man [[H7223]] appears [[H7200]] to me [[H589]] to be running [[H4794]] like Ahimaaz [[H290]] son [[H1121]] of Zadok.” [[H6659]] “This [[H2088]] is a good [[H2896]] man,” [[H376]] said [[H559]] the king. [[H4428]] “He comes [[H935]] with [[H413]] good [[H2896]] news.” [[H1309]]

### 28
Then Ahimaaz [[H290]] called out [[H7121]] to [[H413]] the king, [[H4428]] “All is well!” [[H7965]] And he bowed down [[H7812]] facedown [[H639]] before the king. [[H4428]] He continued, [[H559]] “Blessed [be] [[H1288]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God! [[H430]] He has delivered up [[H5462]] the men [[H376]] who [[H834]] raised [[H5375]] their hands [[H3027]] against my lord [[H113]] the king.” [[H4428]]

### 29
The king [[H4428]] asked, [[H559]] “Is the young man [[H5288]] Absalom [[H53]] safe?” [[H7965]] And Ahimaaz [[H290]] replied, [[H559]] “When Joab [[H3097]] sent [[H7971]] the king’s [[H4428]] servant [[H5650]] and your servant, [[H5650]] I saw [[H7200]] a great [[H1419]] tumult, [[H1995]] but I do not [[H3808]] know [[H3045]] what it was.” [[H4100]]

### 30
“Move aside,” [[H5437]] said [[H559]] the king, [[H4428]] “and stand [[H3320]] here.” [[H3541]] So he stepped [[H5975]] aside. [[H5437]]

### 31
Just then [[H2009]] the Cushite [[H3569]] came [[H935]] and said, [[H559]] “May my lord [[H113]] the king [[H4428]] hear the good news: [[H1319]] Today [[H3117]] the LORD [[H3068]] has avenged you [[H8199]] of [[H3027]] all [[H3605]] who rose up [[H6965]] against you!” [[H5921]]

### 32
The king [[H4428]] asked [[H559]] the Cushite, [[H3569]] “Is the young man [[H5288]] Absalom [[H53]] all right?” [[H7965]] And the Cushite [[H3569]] replied, [[H559]] “May what has become [[H1961]] of the young man [[H5288]] happen to the enemies [[H341]] of my lord [[H113]] the king [[H4428]] and to all [[H3605]] who [[H834]] rise up [[H6965]] against you [[H5921]] to harm you.” [[H7451]]

### 33
The king [[H4428]] was shaken [[H7264]] and went up [[H5927]] to [[H5921]] the gate [[H8179]] chamber [[H5944]] and wept. [[H1058]] And as [[H3541]] he walked, [[H1980]] he cried out, [[H559]] “O my son [[H1121]] Absalom! [[H53]] My son, [[H1121]] my son [[H1121]] Absalom! [[H53]] If only [[H4310]] I [[H589]] had died [[H4191]] instead of you, [[H8478]] O Absalom, [[H53]] my son, [[H1121]] my son! [[H1121]]
