###### 1
Then it was reported [[H5046]] to Joab, [[H3097]] “The king [[H4428]] is weeping [[H1058]] and mourning [[H56]] over [[H5921]] Absalom.” [[H53]]

###### 2
And that [[H1931]] day’s [[H3117]] victory [[H8668]] was turned [[H1961]] into mourning [[H60]] for all [[H3605]] the people, [[H5971]] because [[H3588]] on that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] [they] [[H5971]] were told, [[H8085]] “The king [[H4428]] is grieving [[H6087]] over [[H5921]] his son.” [[H1121]]

###### 3
So they [[H5971]] returned [[H935]] to the city [[H5892]] quietly [[H1589]] that [[H1931]] day, [[H3117]] as [[H834]] people [[H5971]] steal away [[H1589]] in humiliation [[H3637]] after fleeing [[H5127]] a battle. [[H4421]]

###### 4
But the king [[H4428]] covered [[H3813]] his face [[H6440]] and cried out [[H2199]] at the top [[H1419]] of his voice, [[H6963]] “O my son [[H1121]] Absalom! [[H53]] O Absalom, [[H53]] my son, [[H1121]] my son!” [[H1121]]

###### 5
Then Joab [[H3097]] went [[H935]] into [[H413]] the house [[H1004]] and said [[H559]] to the king, [[H4428]] “Today [[H3117]] you have disgraced [[H3001]] all [[H3605]] your servants [[H5650]] who have saved [[H4422]] your life [[H5315]] and the lives [[H5315]] of your sons [[H1121]] and daughters, [[H1323]] of your wives, [[H802]] and of your concubines. [[H6370]]

###### 6
You love [[H157]] those who hate you [[H8130]] and hate [[H8130]] those who love you! [[H157]] For you have made it clear [[H5046]] today [[H3117]] that [[H3588]] the commanders [[H8269]] and soldiers [[H5650]] mean nothing [[H369]] to you.  I know [[H3045]] today [[H3117]] that [[H3588]] if [[H3863]] Absalom [[H53]] were alive [[H2416]] and all [[H3605]] of us were dead, [[H4191]] it would have pleased you! [[H3477]]

###### 7
Now therefore [[H6258]] get up! [[H6965]] Go out [[H3318]] and speak [[H1696]] comfort to [[H3820]] your servants, [[H5650]] for [[H3588]] I swear [[H7650]] by the LORD [[H3068]] that if [[H3588]] you do not [[H369]] go out, [[H3318]] not [[H518]] a man [[H376]] will remain [[H3885]] with you [[H854]] tonight. [[H3915]] This [[H2063]] will be worse [[H7451]] for you  than all [[H3605]] the adversity [[H7451]] that [[H834]] has befallen [[H935]] you [[H5921]] from your youth [[H5271]] until [[H5704]] now! [[H6258]]

###### 8
So the king [[H4428]] got up [[H6965]] and sat [[H3427]] in the gate, [[H8179]] and all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] were told: [[H5046]] “Behold, [[H2009]] the king [[H4428]] is sitting [[H3427]] in the gate.” [[H8179]] So they [[H5971]] all [[H3605]] came [[H935]] before [[H6440]] the king. [[H4428]] Meanwhile, the Israelites [[H3478]] had fled, [[H5127]] each man [[H376]] to his home. [[H168]]

###### 9
And all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] throughout [[H3605]] the tribes [[H7626]] of Israel [[H3478]] were arguing, [[H1777]] “The king [[H4428]] delivered us [[H5337]] from the hand [[H3709]] of our enemies [[H341]] and [[H1931]] rescued us [[H4422]] from the hand [[H3709]] of the Philistines, [[H6430]] but now [[H6258]] he has fled [[H1272]] the land [[H776]] because [[H5921]] of Absalom. [[H53]]

###### 10
But Absalom, [[H53]] the man [[H834]] we anointed [[H4886]] over us, [[H5921]] has died [[H4191]] in battle. [[H4421]] So [[H6258]] why [[H4100]] do you [[H859]] say nothing [[H2790]] about restoring [[H7725]] the king?” [[H4428]]

###### 11
Then King [[H4428]] David [[H1732]] sent this message [[H7971]] to [[H413]] Zadok [[H6659]] and Abiathar, [[H54]] the priests: [[H3548]] “Say [[H1696]] to [[H413]] the elders [[H2205]] of Judah, [[H3063]] ‘Why [[H4100]] should you be [[H1961]] the last [[H314]] to restore [[H7725]] the king [[H4428]] to [[H413]] his palace, [[H1004]] since the talk [[H1697]] of all [[H3605]] Israel [[H3478]] has reached [[H935]] the king [[H4428]] at [[H413]] his quarters? [[H1004]]

###### 12
You [[H859]] are my brothers, [[H251]] my own flesh [[H1320]] and blood. [[H6106]] So why [[H4100]] should you [[H859]] be [[H1961]] the last [[H314]] to restore [[H7725]] the king?’ [[H4428]]

###### 13
And say [[H559]] to Amasa, [[H6021]] ‘Aren’t [[H3808]] you [[H859]] my flesh [[H1320]] and blood? [[H6106]] May God [[H430]] punish [[H3541]] me,  and ever so [[H3541]] severely, [[H3254]] if [[H518]] from this time [[H3605]] you are [[H1961]] not [[H3808]] the commander [[H8269]] of my [[H6440]] army [[H6635]] in place [[H8478]] of Joab!’” [[H3097]]

###### 14
So [Amasa] swayed [[H5186]] the hearts [[H3824]] of all [[H3605]] the men [[H376]] of Judah [[H3063]] as though they were one [[H259]] man, [[H376]] and they sent [[H7971]] word to [[H413]] the king: [[H4428]] “Return, [[H7725]] you [[H859]] and all [[H3605]] your servants.” [[H5650]]

###### 15
So the king [[H4428]] returned, [[H7725]] and when he arrived [[H935]] at [[H5704]] the Jordan, [[H3383]] [the men of] Judah [[H3063]] came [[H935]] to Gilgal [[H1537]] to [[H1980]] meet [[H7125]] [him] [[H4428]] and escort him [[H4428]] across [[H5674]] the Jordan. [[H3383]]

###### 16
Then Shimei [[H8096]] son [[H1121]] of Gera, [[H1617]] a Benjamite [[H1145]] from Bahurim, [[H980]] hurried [[H4116]] down with [[H5973]] the men [[H376]] of Judah [[H3063]] to meet [[H7125]] King [[H4428]] David, [[H1732]]

###### 17
along with a thousand [[H505]] men [[H376]] of Benjamin [[H1144]] and Ziba, [[H6717]] the steward [[H5288]] of the house [[H1004]] of Saul, [[H7586]] and his fifteen [[H2568]] sons [[H1121]] and twenty [[H6242]] servants. [[H5650]] They rushed down [[H6743]] to the Jordan [[H3383]] before [[H6440]] the king [[H4428]]

###### 18
and crossed [[H5674]] at the ford [[H5679]] to carry over [[H5674]] the king’s [[H4428]] household [[H1004]] and to do [[H6213]] what was good [[H2896]] in his sight. [[H5869]] When Shimei [[H8096]] son [[H1121]] of Gera [[H1617]] crossed [[H5674]] the Jordan, [[H3383]] he fell down [[H5307]] before [[H6440]] the king [[H4428]]

###### 19
and said, [[H559]] “My lord, [[H113]] do not [[H408]] hold [[H2803]] me guilty, [[H5771]] and do not [[H408]] remember [[H2142]] your servant’s [[H5650]] wrongdoing [[H5753]] on the day [[H3117]] my lord [[H113]] the king [[H4428]] left [[H3318]] Jerusalem. [[H3389]] May the king [[H4428]] not take [[H7760]] it to [[H413]] heart. [[H3820]]

###### 20
For [[H3588]] your servant [[H5650]] knows [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I [[H589]] have sinned, [[H2398]] so here I am [[H2009]] today [[H3117]] as the first [[H7223]] of all [[H3605]] the house [[H1004]] of Joseph [[H3130]] to come down [[H3381]] to meet [[H7125]] my lord [[H113]] the king.” [[H4428]]

###### 21
But Abishai [[H52]] son [[H1121]] of Zeruiah [[H6870]] said, [[H6030]] “Shouldn’t [[H3808]] Shimei [[H8096]] be put to death [[H4191]] for [[H8478]] this, [[H2063]] because [[H3588]] he cursed [[H7043]] the LORD’s [[H3068]] anointed?” [[H4899]]

###### 22
And David [[H1732]] replied, [[H559]] “Sons [[H1121]] of Zeruiah, [[H6870]] what [[H4100]] have I to do  with you,  that you should be [[H1961]] my  adversaries [[H7854]] today? [[H3117]] Should any man [[H376]] be put to death [[H4191]] in Israel [[H3478]] today? [[H3117]] Am I not [[H3808]] indeed [[H3588]] aware [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] today [[H3117]] I am [[H589]] king [[H4428]] over [[H5921]] Israel? [[H3478]]

###### 23
So the king [[H4428]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Shimei, [[H8096]] “You shall not [[H3808]] die.” [[H4191]] Then the king [[H4428]] swore an oath [[H7650]] to him. 

###### 24
Then Mephibosheth, [[H4648]] Saul’s [[H7586]] grandson, [[H1121]] went down [[H3381]] to meet [[H7125]] the king. [[H4428]] He had not [[H3808]] cared [[H6213]] for his feet [[H7272]] [or] [[H3808]] trimmed [[H6213]] his mustache [[H8222]] [or] [[H853]] washed [[H3526]] his clothes [[H899]] from [[H4480]] the day [[H3117]] the king [[H4428]] had left [[H1980]] until [[H5704]] the day [[H3117]] he returned [[H935]] safely. [[H7965]]

###### 25
And [[H1961]] he came [[H935]] from Jerusalem [[H3389]] to meet [[H7125]] the king, [[H4428]] [who] [[H4428]] asked [[H559]] him,  “Mephibosheth, [[H4648]] why [[H4100]] did you not [[H3808]] go [[H1980]] with me?” [[H5973]]

###### 26
“My lord [[H113]] the king,” [[H4428]] he replied, [[H559]] “because [[H3588]] [I] [[H5650]] am lame, [[H6455]] [I] [[H5650]] said, [[H559]] ‘I will have my donkey [[H2543]] saddled [[H2280]] so that I may ride [[H7392]] on it [[H5921]] and go [[H1980]] with [[H854]] the king.’ [[H4428]] But my servant [Ziba] [[H5650]] deceived me, [[H7411]]

###### 27
and he has slandered [[H7270]] your servant [[H5650]] to [[H413]] my lord [[H113]] the king. [[H4428]] Yet my lord [[H113]] the king [is] [[H4428]] like the Angel [[H4397]] of God, [[H430]] so do [[H6213]] [what is] good [[H2896]] in your eyes. [[H5869]]

###### 28
For [[H3588]] all [[H3605]] the house [[H1004]] of my grandfather [[H1]] deserves death [[H4194]] from my lord [[H113]] the king, [[H4428]] yet you have set [[H7896]] your servant [[H5650]] among those who eat [[H398]] at your table. [[H7979]] What [[H4100]] further [[H5750]] right, then, [[H6666]] do I have [[H3426]] to keep [[H5750]] appealing [[H2199]] to [[H413]] the king?” [[H4428]]

###### 29
The king [[H4428]] replied, [[H559]] “Why [[H4100]] say [[H1696]] any more? [[H5750]] I hereby declare [[H559]] that you [[H859]] and Ziba [[H6717]] are to divide [[H2505]] the land.” [[H7704]]

###### 30
And Mephibosheth [[H4648]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] the king, [[H4428]] “Instead, [[H1571]] since [[H310]] my lord [[H113]] the king [[H4428]] has safely [[H7965]] come [[H935]] to [[H413]] his own house, [[H1004]] let Ziba take [[H3947]] it all!” [[H3605]]

###### 31
Now Barzillai [[H1271]] the Gileadite [[H1569]] had come down [[H3381]] from Rogelim [[H7274]] to cross [[H5674]] the Jordan [[H3383]] with [[H854]] the king [[H4428]] and send him on his way [[H7971]] [from there]. [[H3383]]

###### 32
Barzillai [[H1271]] was quite [[H3966]] old, [[H2204]] eighty [[H8084]] years [[H8141]] of age, [[H1121]] and since [[H3588]] he was a very [[H3966]] wealthy [[H1419]] man, [[H376]] he [[H1931]] had provided [[H3557]] for the king [[H4428]] while he stayed [[H7871]] in Mahanaim. [[H4266]]

###### 33
The king [[H4428]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Barzillai, [[H1271]] “Cross over [[H5674]] with me, [[H854]] and I will provide [[H3557]] for you [[H853]] at my side [[H5978]] in Jerusalem.” [[H3389]]

###### 34
But Barzillai [[H1271]] replied, [[H559]] “How many [[H4100]] years [[H3117]] of my life [remain], [[H2416]] that [[H3588]] I should go up [[H5927]] to Jerusalem [[H3389]] with [[H854]] the king? [[H4428]]

###### 35
I am [[H595]] now [[H3117]] eighty [[H8084]] years old. [[H1121]] Can I discern [[H3045]] what is good [[H2896]] and what is not? [[H7451]] Can your servant [[H5650]] taste [[H2938]] what [[H834]] he eats [[H398]] or drinks? [[H8354]] Can I still [[H5750]] hear [[H8085]] the voice [[H6963]] of singing men [[H7891]] and women? [[H7891]] Why [[H4100]] should your servant [[H5650]] be [[H1961]] an added [[H5750]] burden [[H4853]] to [[H413]] my lord [[H113]] the king? [[H4428]]

###### 36
Your servant [[H5650]] could go with [[H854]] the king [[H4428]] only a short distance [[H4592]] past [[H5674]] the Jordan; [[H3383]] why [[H4100]] should the king [[H4428]] repay [[H1580]] me with such [[H2063]] a reward? [[H1578]]

###### 37
Please [[H4994]] let your servant [[H5650]] return, [[H7725]] that I may die [[H4191]] in my own city [[H5892]] near [[H5973]] the tomb [[H6913]] of my father [[H1]] and mother. [[H517]] But here [[H2009]] is your servant [[H5650]] Chimham. [[H3643]] Let him cross over [[H5674]] with [[H5973]] my lord [[H113]] the king, [[H4428]] and do [[H6213]] for him  what [[H834]] is good [[H2896]] in your sight. [[H5869]]

###### 38
The king [[H4428]] replied, [[H559]] “Chimham [[H3643]] will cross over [[H5674]] with me, [[H854]] and I [[H589]] will do [[H6213]] for him  what seems good [[H2896]] in your sight, [[H5869]] and I will do [[H6213]] for you  whatever [[H3605]] you desire [[H977]] of me.” [[H5921]]

###### 39
So all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] crossed [[H5674]] the Jordan, [[H3383]] and then the king [[H4428]] crossed over. [[H5674]] The king [[H4428]] kissed [[H5401]] Barzillai [[H1271]] and blessed him, [[H1288]] and Barzillai returned [[H7725]] home. [[H4725]]

###### 40
Then the king [[H4428]] went on [[H5674]] to Gilgal, [[H1537]] and Chimham [[H3643]] crossed over [[H5674]] with him. [[H5973]] All [[H3605]] the troops [[H5971]] of Judah [[H3063]] and [[H1571]] half [[H2677]] the troops [[H5971]] of Israel [[H3478]] escorted the king. [[H4428]]

###### 41
Soon [[H2009]] all [[H3605]] the men [[H376]] of Israel [[H3478]] came [[H935]] to [[H413]] the king [[H4428]] and asked, [[H559]] “Why [[H4069]] did our brothers, [[H251]] the men [[H376]] of Judah, [[H3063]] take you away secretly [[H1589]] and bring the king [[H4428]] and his household [[H1004]] across [[H5674]] the Jordan, [[H3383]] together with [[H5973]] all [[H3605]] of David’s [[H1732]] men? [[H376]]

###### 42
And all [[H3605]] the men [[H376]] of Judah [[H3063]] replied [[H6030]] to [[H5921]] the men [[H376]] of Israel, [[H3478]] “[We did this] because [[H3588]] the king [[H4428]] is our [[H413]] relative. [[H7138]] Why [[H4100]] does this [[H2088]] anger you? [[H2734]] Have we ever eaten [[H398]] at [[H4480]] the king's [expense] [[H4428]] or [[H518]] received [[H5375]] anything [[H5379]] for ourselves?” 

###### 43
“We have ten [[H6235]] shares [[H3027]] in the king,” [[H4428]] answered [[H6030]] the men [[H376]] of Israel, [[H3478]] “so we have more claim [[H1571]] to David [[H1732]] than you. [[H4480]] Why [[H4069]] then do you despise us? [[H7043]] Were we not [[H3808]] the first [[H7223]] to speak [[H1697]] of restoring [[H7725]] our king?” [[H4428]] But the men [[H376]] of Judah [[H3063]] pressed even harder [[H7185]] [than] [[H1697]] the men [[H376]] of Israel. [[H3478]]
