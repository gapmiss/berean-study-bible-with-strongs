###### 1
Some time later, [[H1961]] Absalom [[H53]] provided for [[H6213]] himself  a chariot [[H4818]] with horses [[H5483]] and fifty [[H2572]] men [[H376]] to run [[H7323]] before him. [[H6440]]

###### 2
He [[H53]] would get up early [[H7925]] and stand [[H5975]] beside [[H5921]] the road [[H1870]] leading to the city gate. [[H8179]] Whenever anyone [[H3605]] had [[H1961]] a grievance [[H7379]] to bring [[H935]] before [[H413]] the king [[H4428]] for a decision, [[H4941]] Absalom [[H53]] would call out [[H7121]] and ask, [[H559]] “What [[H335]] city [[H5892]] are you from?” [[H859]] And if he replied, [[H559]] “Your servant [is] [[H5650]] from one [[H259]] of the tribes [[H7626]] of Israel,” [[H3478]]

###### 3
Absalom [[H53]] would say, [[H559]] “Look, [[H7200]] your claims [[H1697]] are good [[H2896]] and right, [[H5228]] but the king [[H4428]] [has] no deputy [[H369]] to hear [[H8085]] you.” 

###### 4
And [he] [[H53]] would add, [[H559]] “If only [[H4310]] someone would appoint [[H7760]] me judge [[H8199]] in the land, [[H776]] then everyone [[H3605]] with [[H834]] a grievance [[H7379]] or dispute [[H4941]] could come [[H935]] to me, [[H5921]] and I would give him justice.” [[H6663]]

###### 5
Also, when [[H1961]] anyone [[H376]] approached [[H7126]] to bow down [[H7812]] to him,  Absalom would reach out [[H7971]] his hand, [[H3027]] take hold [[H2388]] of him,  and kiss [[H5401]] him. 

###### 6
Absalom [[H53]] did [[H6213]] this [[H2088]] to all [[H3605]] the Israelites [[H3478]] who [[H834]] came [[H935]] to [[H413]] the king [[H4428]] for justice. [[H4941]] In this way he [[H53]] stole [[H1589]] the hearts [[H3820]] of the men [[H376]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

###### 7
After [[H7093]] four [[H705]] years [[H8141]] had passed, [[H1961]] Absalom [[H53]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] the king, [[H4428]] “Please [[H4994]] let me go [[H1980]] to Hebron [[H2275]] to fulfill [[H7999]] a vow [[H5088]] I have made [[H5087]] to the LORD. [[H3068]]

###### 8
For [[H3588]] your servant [[H5650]] made [[H5087]] a vow [[H5088]] while dwelling [[H3427]] in Geshur [[H1650]] of Aram, [[H758]] saying: [[H559]] ‘If [[H518]] indeed [[H7725]] the LORD [[H3068]] brings me back [[H7725]] to Jerusalem, [[H3389]] I will worship [[H5647]] the LORD in Hebron.’” [[H3068]]

###### 9
“Go [[H1980]] in peace,” [[H7965]] said [[H559]] the king. [[H4428]] So [Absalom] arose [[H6965]] and went [[H1980]] to Hebron. [[H2275]]

###### 10
Then Absalom [[H53]] sent [[H7971]] spies [[H7270]] throughout [[H3605]] the tribes [[H7626]] of Israel [[H3478]] with this message: [[H559]] “When you hear [[H8085]] the sound [[H6963]] of the trumpet, [[H7782]] you are to say, [[H559]] ‘Absalom [[H53]] reigns [[H4427]] in Hebron!’” [[H2275]]

###### 11
Two hundred [[H3967]] men [[H376]] from Jerusalem [[H3389]] accompanied [[H1980]] Absalom. [[H53]] They had been invited as guests [[H7121]] and they went along [[H1980]] innocently, [[H8537]] for they knew [[H3045]] nothing [[H3808]] about [[H3605]] the matter. [[H1697]]

###### 12
While [Absalom] was offering [[H2076]] the sacrifices, [[H2077]] [he] [[H53]] sent for [[H7971]] Ahithophel [[H302]] the Gilonite, [[H1526]] David’s [[H1732]] counselor, [[H3289]] [to come] from his hometown [[H5892]] of Giloh. [[H1542]] So the conspiracy [[H7195]] gained [[H1961]] strength, [[H533]] and Absalom's [[H53]] following [[H5971]] kept [[H1980]] increasing. [[H7227]]

###### 13
Then a messenger [[H5046]] came [[H935]] to [[H413]] David [[H1732]] and reported, [[H559]] “The hearts [[H3820]] of the men [[H376]] of Israel [[H3478]] are [[H1961]] with [[H310]] Absalom.” [[H53]]

###### 14
And David [[H1732]] said [[H559]] to all [[H3605]] the servants [[H5650]] with [[H854]] him in Jerusalem, [[H3389]] “Arise [[H6965]] and let us flee, [[H1272]] or [[H3588]] we will not [[H3808]] escape [[H6413]] from [[H6440]] Absalom! [[H53]] We must leave [[H1980]] quickly, [[H4116]] or [[H6435]] he will soon [[H4116]] overtake us, [[H5381]] heap [[H5080]] disaster [[H7451]] on us, [[H5921]] and put [[H5221]] the city [[H5892]] to [[H6310]] the sword. [[H2719]]

###### 15
The king’s [[H4428]] servants [[H5650]] replied, [[H559]] “Whatever [[H3605]] our lord [[H113]] the king [[H4428]] decides, [[H977]] we are your servants.” [[H5650]]

###### 16
Then the king [[H4428]] set out, [[H3318]] and his entire [[H3605]] household [[H1004]] followed him. [[H7272]] But he [[H4428]] left behind [[H5800]] ten [[H6235]] concubines [[H6370]] to take care of [[H8104]] the palace. [[H1004]]

###### 17
So the king [[H4428]] set out [[H3318]] with all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] following him. [[H7272]] [He] stopped [[H5975]] at  the last house, [[H1023]]

###### 18
and all [[H3605]] his servants [[H5650]] marched [[H5674]] past [[H5921]] him— [[H3027]] all [[H3605]] the Cherethites [[H3774]] and [[H3605]] Pelethites, [[H6432]] and [[H3605]] six [[H8337]] hundred [[H3967]] Gittites [[H1663]] who [[H834]] had followed [[H935]] him [[H7272]] from Gath. [[H1661]]

###### 19
Then the king [[H4428]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Ittai [[H863]] the Gittite, [[H1663]] “Why [[H4100]] should you [[H859]] also [[H1571]] go [[H1980]] with us? [[H854]] Go back [[H7725]] and stay [[H3427]] with [[H5973]] the new king, [[H4428]] since [[H3588]] you are [[H859]] both a foreigner [[H5237]] and [[H1571]] an exile [[H1540]] from your homeland. [[H4725]]

###### 20
In fact, you arrived [[H935]] [only] yesterday; [[H8543]] should I make you [[H5128]] wander around [[H1980]] with us [[H5973]] today [[H3117]] while I [[H589]] do not know [[H1980]] where [[H834]] I [[H589]] am going? [[H1980]] Go back [[H7725]] and take [[H7725]] your brothers [[H251]] with you. [[H5973]] May the LORD show you loving devotion [[H2617]] and faithfulness.” [[H571]]

###### 21
But Ittai [[H863]] answered [[H6030]] the king, [[H4428]] “As surely as the LORD [[H3068]] lives, [[H2416]] and as my lord [[H113]] the king [[H4428]] lives, [[H2416]] wherever [[H4725]] my lord [[H113]] the king [[H4428]] may be, [[H1961]] whether [[H518]] it means life [[H2416]] or [[H518]] death, [[H4194]] there will [[H8033]] your servant [[H5650]] be!” [[H1961]]

###### 22
“March on then,” [[H5674]] said [[H559]] David [[H1732]] to [[H413]] Ittai. [[H863]] So Ittai [[H863]] the Gittite [[H1663]] marched past [[H5674]] with all [[H3605]] his men [[H376]] and all [[H3605]] the little ones [[H2945]] who [were] [[H834]] with him. [[H854]]

###### 23
Everyone [[H3605]] in the countryside [[H776]] was weeping [[H1058]] loudly [[H6963]] as all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] passed by. [[H5674]] And as the king [[H4428]] crossed [[H5674]] the Kidron [[H6939]] Valley, [[H5158]] all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] also passed [[H5674]] toward [[H5921]] the way [[H1870]] of the wilderness. [[H4057]]

###### 24
Zadok [[H6659]] was also [[H1571]] there, [[H2009]] and all [[H3605]] the Levites [[H3881]] with [[H854]] him were carrying [[H5375]] the ark [[H727]] of the covenant [[H1285]] of God. [[H430]] And they set down [[H3332]] the ark [[H727]] of God, [[H430]] and Abiathar [[H54]] offered [[H5927]] sacrifices until [[H5704]] the people [[H5971]] had finished [[H8552]] passing [[H5674]] out of the city. [[H5892]]

###### 25
Then the king [[H4428]] said [[H559]] to Zadok, [[H6659]] “Return [[H7725]] the ark [[H727]] of God [[H430]] to the city. [[H5892]] If [[H518]] I find [[H4672]] favor [[H2580]] in the eyes [[H5869]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] He will bring me back [[H7725]] and let me see [[H7200]] [both] it [[H853]] and [[H853]] His dwelling place {again}. [[H5116]]

###### 26
But if [[H518]] He should say, [[H559]] ‘I do not [[H3808]] delight [[H2654]] in you,’  then here I am; [[H2005]] let Him do [[H6213]] to me  whatever [[H834]] seems good [[H2896]] to Him.” [[H5869]]

###### 27
The king [[H4428]] also said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Zadok [[H6659]] the priest, [[H3548]] “[Are you not] a seer? [[H7200]] Return [[H7725]] to the city [[H5892]] in peace [[H7965]] with your son [[H1121]] Ahimaaz [[H290]] and Jonathan [[H3083]] the son [[H1121]] of Abiathar. [[H54]] [You and Abiathar take] your two [[H8147]] sons [[H1121]] with you. [[H854]]

###### 28
See, [[H7200]] I will [[H595]] wait [[H4102]] at the fords [[H5679]] of the wilderness [[H4057]] until [[H5704]] word [[H1697]] comes [[H935]] from you [[H5973]] to inform [[H5046]] me.” 

###### 29
So Zadok [[H6659]] and Abiathar [[H54]] returned [[H7725]] the ark [[H727]] of God [[H430]] to Jerusalem [[H3389]] and stayed [[H3427]] there. [[H8033]]

###### 30
But David [[H1732]] continued up [[H5927]] the [Mount of] Olives, [[H2132]] weeping [[H1058]] as he went up. [[H5927]] His head [[H7218]] was covered, [[H2645]] and he [[H1931]] was walking [[H1980]] barefoot. [[H3182]] And all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] with him [[H854]] covered [[H2645]] their heads [[H7218]] and went up, [[H5927]] weeping [[H1058]] as they went. [[H5927]]

###### 31
Now someone told [[H5046]] David: [[H1732]] “Ahithophel [is] [[H302]] among the conspirators [[H7194]] with [[H5973]] Absalom.” [[H53]] So David [[H1732]] pleaded, [[H559]] “O LORD, [[H3068]] please [[H4994]] turn the counsel [[H6098]] of Ahithophel [[H302]] into foolishness!” [[H5528]]

###### 32
When [[H1961]] David [[H1732]] came [[H935]] to [[H5704]] the summit, [[H7218]] where [[H834]] he used to worship [[H7812]] God, [[H430]] Hushai [[H2365]] the Archite [[H757]] was there [[H2009]] to meet him [[H7125]] with his robe [[H3801]] torn [[H7167]] and dust [[H127]] on [[H5921]] his head. [[H7218]]

###### 33
David [[H1732]] said to him, [[H559]] “If [[H518]] you go on [[H5674]] with me, [[H854]] you will be [[H1961]] a burden [[H4853]] to me, [[H5921]]

###### 34
but if [[H518]] you return [[H7725]] to the city [[H5892]] and say [[H559]] to Absalom, [[H53]] ‘I [[H589]] will be [[H1961]] your servant, [[H5650]] my king! [[H4428]] In the past [[H227]] I [[H589]] was your father’s [[H1]] servant, [[H5650]] but now [[H6258]] I [[H589]] will be your servant,’ [[H5650]] then you can thwart [[H6565]] the counsel [[H6098]] of Ahithophel [[H302]] for me. 

###### 35
Will not [[H3808]] Zadok [[H6659]] and Abiathar [[H54]] the priests [[H3548]] be there [[H8033]] with you? [[H5973]] Report [[H5046]] [to them] [[H6659]] everything [[H3605]] you hear [[H8085]] from the king’s [[H4428]] palace. [[H1004]]

###### 36
Indeed, [[H2009]] their two [[H8147]] sons, [[H1121]] Ahimaaz [[H290]] [son] of Zadok [[H6659]] and Jonathan [[H3083]] [son] of Abiathar, [[H54]] are there [[H8033]] with them. [[H5973]] Send [[H7971]] them [[H3027]] to me [[H413]] with everything [[H3605]] you hear.” [[H8085]]

###### 37
So David's [[H1732]] friend [[H7463]] Hushai [[H2365]] arrived [[H935]] in Jerusalem [[H3389]] just as Absalom [[H53]] was entering [[H935]] the city. [[H5892]]
