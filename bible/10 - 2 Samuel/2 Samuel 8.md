Some time later, [[H1961]] David [[H1732]] defeated [[H5221]] the Philistines, [[H6430]] subdued them, [[H3665]] and took [[H3947]] Metheg-ammah [[H4965]] from the hand [[H3027]] of the Philistines. [[H6430]]

### 2
[David] also defeated [[H5221]] the Moabites, [[H4124]] made them lie down [[H7901]] on the ground, [[H776]] and he measured them off [[H4058]] with a cord. [[H2256]] He measured off [[H4058]] with two [[H8147]] lengths [[H2256]] those to be put to death, [[H4191]] and with one [[H4393]] length [[H2256]] those to be spared. [[H2421]] So the Moabites [[H4124]] became [[H1961]] subject [[H5650]] to David [[H1732]] and brought him [[H5375]] tribute. [[H4503]]

### 3
David [[H1732]] also defeated [[H5221]] Hadadezer [[H1909]] son [[H1121]] of Rehob, [[H7340]] king [[H4428]] of Zobah, [[H6678]] who had marched out [[H1980]] to restore [[H7725]] his dominion [[H3027]] along the Euphrates [[H6578]] River. [[H5104]]

### 4
David [[H1732]] captured [[H3920]] from him [[H4480]] a thousand [chariots], [[H505]] seven [[H7651]] thousand [[H3967]] charioteers, [[H6571]] and twenty [[H6242]] thousand [[H505]] foot soldiers, [[H376]] and he [[H1732]] hamstrung [[H6131]] all [[H3605]] the horses [[H7393]] except a hundred [[H3967]] he kept [[H3498]] for the chariots. [[H7393]]

### 5
When the Arameans [[H758]] of Damascus [[H1834]] came [[H935]] to help [[H5826]] King [[H4428]] Hadadezer [[H1909]] of Zobah, [[H6678]] David [[H1732]] struck down [[H5221]] twenty-two [[H6242]] thousand [[H505]] men. [[H376]]

### 6
Then he [[H1732]] placed [[H7760]] garrisons [[H5333]] in Aram [[H758]] of Damascus, [[H1834]] and the Arameans [[H758]] became [[H1961]] subject [[H5650]] to David [[H1732]] and brought him [[H5375]] tribute. [[H4503]] So the LORD [[H3068]] made David [[H1732]] victorious [[H3467]] wherever [[H3605]] he went. [[H1980]]

### 7
And David [[H1732]] took [[H3947]] the gold [[H2091]] shields [[H7982]] that [[H834]] belonged [[H1961]] to [[H413]] the officers [[H5650]] of Hadadezer [[H1909]] and brought them [[H935]] to Jerusalem. [[H3389]]

### 8
And from Betah [[H984]] and Berothai, [[H1268]] cities [[H5892]] of Hadadezer, [[H1909]] King [[H4428]] David [[H1732]] took [[H3947]] a great [[H3966]] amount [[H7235]] of bronze. [[H5178]]

### 9
When King [[H4428]] Toi [[H8583]] of Hamath [[H2574]] heard [[H8085]] that [[H3588]] David [[H1732]] had defeated [[H5221]] the entire [[H3605]] army [[H2426]] of Hadadezer, [[H1909]]

### 10
he [[H8583]] sent [[H7971]] his son [[H1121]] Joram [[H3141]] to greet [[H7592]] King [[H4428]] David [[H1732]] and bless him [[H1288]] for [[H5921]] fighting [[H3898]] against Hadadezer [[H1909]] and defeating him. [[H5221]] For [[H3588]] Toi [[H8583]] and Hadadezer [[H1909]] had been [[H1961]] at war. [[H4421]] [Joram] brought [[H1961]] with him [[H3027]] articles [[H3627]] of silver [[H3701]] and [[H3627]] gold [[H2091]] and [[H3627]] bronze, [[H5178]]

### 11
and [[H1571]] King [[H4428]] David [[H1732]] dedicated [[H6942]] these [[H853]] to the LORD, [[H3068]] along with [[H5973]] the silver [[H3701]] and gold [[H2091]] he had dedicated [[H6942]] from all [[H3605]] the nations [[H1471]] he had subdued— [[H3533]]

from Edom [[H758]] and Moab, [[H4124]] from the Ammonites [[H1121]] and Philistines [[H6430]] and Amalekites, [[H6002]] and from the spoil [[H7998]] of Hadadezer [[H1909]] son [[H1121]] of Rehob, [[H7340]] king [[H4428]] of Zobah. [[H6678]]

### 13
And David [[H1732]] made [[H6213]] a name for himself [[H8034]] when he returned [[H7725]] from striking down [[H5221]] eighteen [[H8083]] thousand [[H505]] Edomites [[H758]] in the Valley of Salt. [[H1516]]

### 14
He placed [[H7760]] garrisons [[H5333]] throughout [[H3605]] Edom, [[H123]] and all [[H3605]] the Edomites [[H123]] were [[H1961]] subject [[H5650]] to David. [[H1732]] So the LORD [[H3068]] made David [[H1732]] victorious [[H3467]] wherever [[H3605]] he went. [[H1980]]

### 15
Thus David [[H1732]] reigned [[H4427]] over [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] Israel [[H3478]] and administered [[H6213]] justice [[H4941]] and righteousness [[H6666]] for all [[H3605]] his people: [[H5971]]
