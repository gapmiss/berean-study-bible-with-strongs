### 1
Now during the reign [[H3117]] of David [[H1732]] there was [[H1961]] a famine [[H7458]] for three [[H7969]] successive years, [[H8141]] and David [[H1732]] sought [[H1245]] the face [[H6440]] of the LORD. [[H3068]] And the LORD [[H3068]] said, [[H559]] “It is because of [[H413]] the blood [[H1818]] shed by Saul [[H7586]] and his family, [[H1004]] because [[H834]] he killed [[H4191]] the Gibeonites.” [[H1393]]

### 2
At this, David [[H4428]] summoned [[H7121]] the Gibeonites [[H1393]] and spoke [[H559]] to them. [[H413]] (Now the Gibeonites [[H1393]] were [[H1992]] not [[H3808]] Israelites, [[H1121]] but [[H3588]] a remnant [[H3499]] of the Amorites. [[H567]] The Israelites [[H1121]] had taken an oath concerning them, [[H7650]] but in his zeal [[H7065]] for Israel [[H1121]] and Judah, [[H3063]] Saul [[H7586]] had sought [[H1245]] to kill them.) [[H5221]]

### 3
So David [[H1732]] asked [[H559]] the Gibeonites, [[H1393]] “What [[H4100]] shall I do [[H6213]] for you?  How [[H4100]] can I make amends [[H3722]] so that you may bless [[H1288]] the inheritance [[H5159]] of the LORD?” [[H3068]]

### 4
The Gibeonites [[H1393]] said to him, [[H559]] “We need no [[H369]] silver [[H3701]] or gold [[H2091]] from [[H5973]] Saul [[H7586]] or [[H5973]] his house, [[H1004]] nor [[H369]] should you [[H376]] put to death [[H4191]] anyone in Israel [[H3478]] for us.”  “Whatever [[H4100]] you [[H859]] ask, [[H559]] I will do for you,” [[H6213]] he replied. [[H559]]

### 5
And they answered [[H559]] the king, [[H4428]] “As for the man [[H376]] who [[H834]] consumed us [[H3615]] and [[H834]] plotted [[H1819]] against us  to exterminate us [[H8045]] from existing [[H3320]] within any [[H3605]] border [[H1366]] of Israel, [[H3478]]

### 6
let seven [[H7651]] of his male descendants [[H1121]] be delivered [[H5414]] to us  so that we may hang them [[H3363]] before the LORD [[H3068]] in Gibeah [[H1390]] of Saul, [[H7586]] the chosen [[H972]] of the LORD.” [[H3068]] “I [[H589]] will give them to you,” [[H5414]] said [[H559]] the king. [[H4428]]

### 7
Now the king [[H4428]] spared [[H2550]] Mephibosheth [[H4648]] son [[H1121]] of Jonathan, [[H3083]] the son [[H1121]] of Saul, [[H7586]] because of [[H5921]] the oath [[H7621]] before the LORD [[H3068]] between [[H996]] David [[H1732]] and [[H996]] Jonathan [[H3083]] son [[H1121]] of Saul. [[H7586]]

### 8
But the king [[H4428]] took [[H3947]] Armoni [[H764]] and Mephibosheth, [[H4648]] the two [[H8147]] sons [[H1121]] whom [[H834]] Rizpah [[H7532]] daughter [[H1323]] of Aiah [[H345]] had borne [[H3205]] to Saul, [[H7586]] and the five [[H2568]] sons [[H1121]] whom [[H834]] Merab [[H4324]] daughter [[H1323]] of Saul [[H7586]] had borne [[H3205]] to Adriel [[H5741]] son [[H1121]] of Barzillai [[H1271]] the Meholathite, [[H4259]]

### 9
and he delivered them [[H5414]] into the hands [[H3027]] of the Gibeonites, [[H1393]] and they hanged them [[H3363]] on the hill [[H2022]] before [[H6440]] the LORD. [[H3068]] So all seven of them [[H7651]] fell [[H5307]] together; [[H3162]] they [[H1992]] were put to death [[H4191]] in the first [[H7223]] days [[H3117]] of the harvest, [[H7105]] at the beginning [[H8462]] of the barley [[H8184]] harvest. [[H7105]]

### 10
And Rizpah [[H7532]] the daughter [[H1323]] of Aiah [[H345]] took [[H3947]] sackcloth [[H8242]] and spread it out [[H5186]] for herself  on [[H413]] a rock. [[H6697]] From [[H4480]] the beginning [[H8462]] of the harvest [[H7105]] until [[H5704]] the rain [[H4325]] from heaven [[H8064]] poured down [[H5413]] on the bodies, [[H5921]] she did not allow [[H5414]] the birds [[H5775]] of the air [[H8064]] to rest [[H5117]] on them [[H5921]] by day, [[H3119]] nor [[H853]] the beasts [[H2416]] of the field [[H7704]] by night. [[H3915]]

### 11
When David [[H1732]] was told [[H5046]] what [[H834]] Saul’s [[H7586]] concubine [[H6370]] Rizpah, [[H7532]] daughter [[H1323]] of Aiah, [[H345]] had done, [[H6213]]

### 12
he [[H1732]] went [[H1980]] and took [[H3947]] the bones [[H6106]] of Saul [[H7586]] and his son [[H1121]] Jonathan [[H3083]] from [[H853]] the men [[H1167]] of Jabesh-gilead, [[H3003]] [who] [[H834]] had stolen [[H1589]] them [[H853]] from the public square [[H7339]] of  Beth-shan [[H1052]] where [[H834]] the Philistines [[H6430]] had hung [the bodies] [[H8518]] after [[H3117]] [they] [[H6430]] had struck down [[H5221]] Saul [[H7586]] at Gilboa. [[H1533]]

### 13
[So David had] the bones [[H6106]] of Saul [[H7586]] and [[H853]] his son [[H1121]] Jonathan [[H3083]] brought [[H5927]] from there, [[H8033]] [along with] [[H622]] the bones [[H6106]] of those who had been hanged. [[H3363]]

### 14
And they buried [[H6912]] the bones [[H6106]] of Saul [[H7586]] and his son [[H1121]] Jonathan [[H3083]] in Zela [[H6762]] in the land [[H776]] of Benjamin, [[H1144]] in the tomb [[H6913]] of Saul’s father [[H1]] Kish. [[H7027]] After [[H310]] they had done [[H6213]] everything [[H3605]] the king [[H4428]] had commanded, [[H6680]] God [[H430]] answered their prayers [[H6279]] for the land. [[H776]]

### 15
Once again [[H5750]] the Philistines [[H6430]] waged war [[H4421]] against [[H854]] Israel, [[H3478]] and David [[H1732]] and his servants [[H5650]] went down [[H3381]] and fought [[H3898]] against [[H854]] the Philistines; [[H6430]] but David [[H1732]] became exhausted. [[H5774]]

### 16
Then Ishbi-benob, [[H3430]] a descendant [[H3211]] of Rapha, [[H7497]] whose bronze [[H5178]] spear [[H7013]] weighed [[H4948]] three [[H7969]] hundred [[H3967]] [shekels] [[H4948]] and who [[H1931]] was bearing [[H2296]] a new [sword], [[H2319]] resolved [[H559]] to kill [[H5221]] David. [[H1732]]

### 17
But Abishai [[H52]] son [[H1121]] of Zeruiah [[H6870]] came to his aid, [[H5826]] struck [[H5221]] the Philistine, [[H6430]] and killed him. [[H4191]] Then [[H227]] David’s [[H1732]] men [[H376]] swore [[H7650]] to him,  “You must never [[H3808]] again [[H5750]] go out [[H3318]] with us [[H854]] to battle, [[H4421]] so that the lamp [[H5216]] of Israel [[H3478]] may not [[H3808]] be extinguished. [[H3518]]

### 18
Some time later, [[H310]] there was [[H1961]] another [[H5750]] battle [[H4421]] with [[H5973]] the Philistines [[H6430]] at Gob. [[H1359]] At that time [[H227]] Sibbecai [[H5444]] the Hushathite [[H2843]] killed [[H5221]] Saph, [[H5593]] one [[H834]] of the descendants [[H3211]] of Rapha. [[H7497]]

### 19
Once again [[H5750]] there was [[H1961]] a battle [[H4421]] with [[H5973]] the Philistines [[H6430]] at Gob, [[H1359]] and Elhanan [[H445]] son [[H1121]] of Jair [[H3296]] the Bethlehemite [[H1022]] killed [[H5221]] [the brother of] Goliath [[H1555]] the Gittite, [[H1663]] the shaft [[H6086]] of whose spear [[H2595]] was like a weaver’s [[H707]] beam. [[H4500]]

### 20
And there was [[H1961]] still another [[H5750]] battle [[H4421]] at Gath, [[H1661]] where there was a man [[H376]] of  [great] stature [[H4067]] with [[H1961]] six [[H8337]] fingers [[H676]] on each hand [[H3027]] and six [[H8337]] toes [[H676]] on each foot— [[H7272]] twenty-four [[H6242]] in all. [[H4557]] He [[H1931]] too [[H1571]] was descended [[H3205]] from Rapha, [[H7497]]

### 21
and when he taunted [[H2778]] Israel, [[H3478]] Jonathan [[H3083]] the son [[H1121]] of David's [[H1732]] brother [[H251]] Shimei [[H8096]] killed him. [[H5221]]

### 22
So these [[H428]] four [[H702]] descendants [[H3205]] of Rapha [[H7497]] in Gath [[H1661]] fell [[H5307]] at the hands [[H3027]] of David [[H1732]] and his servants. [[H5650]]
