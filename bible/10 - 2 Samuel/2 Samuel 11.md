###### 1
In the spring, [[H8666]] at the time when [[H6256]] kings [[H4428]] march out to war, [[H3318]] David [[H1732]] sent [[H7971]] Joab [[H3097]] with [[H853]] his servants [[H5650]] and [[H853]] the whole [army] [[H3605]] of Israel. [[H3478]] They destroyed [[H7843]] the Ammonites [[H1121]] and besieged [[H6696]] Rabbah, [[H7237]] but David [[H1732]] remained [[H3427]] in Jerusalem. [[H3389]]

###### 2
One evening [[H6153]] David [[H1732]] got up [[H6965]] from [[H5921]] his bed [[H4904]] and strolled around [[H1980]] on [[H5921]] the roof [[H1406]] of the palace. [[H1004]] And from [[H5921]] the roof [[H1406]] he saw [[H7200]] a woman [[H802]] bathing— [[H7364]] a very [[H3966]] beautiful [[H2896]] woman. [[H802]]

###### 3
So David [[H1732]] sent [[H7971]] and inquired [[H1875]] about the woman, [[H802]] and he was told, [[H559]] “This [[H2063]] is Bathsheba, [[H1339]] the daughter [[H1323]] of Eliam [[H463]] and the wife [[H802]] of Uriah [[H223]] the Hittite.” [[H2850]]

###### 4
Then David [[H1732]] sent [[H7971]] messengers [[H4397]] to get her, [[H3947]] and when she came [[H935]] to him, [[H413]] he slept [[H7901]] with her. [[H5973]] (Now she [[H1931]] had just purified herself [[H6942]] from her uncleanness.) [[H2932]] Then she returned [[H7725]] home. [[H1004]]

###### 5
And the woman [[H802]] conceived [[H2029]] and sent word [[H7971]] to David, [[H1732]] saying, [[H559]] “I [[H595]] am pregnant.” [[H2030]]

###### 6
At this, David [[H1732]] sent orders [[H7971]] to [[H413]] Joab: [[H3097]] “Send me [[H7971]] Uriah [[H223]] the Hittite.” [[H2850]] So Joab [[H3097]] sent [[H7971]] [him] [[H223]] to [[H413]] David. [[H1732]]

###### 7
When Uriah [[H223]] came [[H935]] to him, [[H413]] David [[H1732]] asked [[H7592]] how Joab [[H3097]] and the troops [[H5971]] were doing [[H7965]] with the war. [[H4421]]

###### 8
Then [he] [[H1732]] said [[H559]] to Uriah, [[H223]] “Go down [[H3381]] to your house [[H1004]] and wash [[H7364]] your feet.” [[H7272]] So Uriah [[H223]] left [[H3318]] the palace, [[H1004]] and a gift [[H4864]] from the king [[H4428]] followed [[H3318]] him. [[H310]]

###### 9
But Uriah [[H223]] slept [[H7901]] at the door [[H6607]] of the palace [[H1004]] with [[H854]] all [[H3605]] his master’s [[H113]] servants; [[H5650]] he did not [[H3808]] go down [[H3381]] to [[H413]] his house. [[H1004]]

###### 10
When David [[H1732]] was told, [[H5046]] “Uriah [[H223]] did not [[H3808]] go [[H3381]] home,” [[H1004]] [he] [[H1732]] questioned [[H559]] Uriah, [[H223]] “Have you not [[H3808]] just come [[H935]] from a journey? [[H1870]] Why [[H4069]] did you not [[H3808]] go [[H3381]] home?” [[H1004]]

###### 11
Uriah [[H223]] answered, [[H559]] “The ark [[H727]] and Israel [[H3478]] and Judah [[H3063]] are dwelling [[H3427]] in tents, [[H5521]] and my master [[H113]] Joab [[H3097]] and his [[H113]] soldiers [[H5650]] are camped [[H2583]] in [[H5921]] the open field. [[H6440]] How can I [[H589]] go [[H935]] to [[H413]] my house [[H1004]] to eat [[H398]] and drink [[H8354]] and sleep [[H7901]] with [[H5973]] my wife? [[H802]] As surely as you live, [[H2416]] and [as] your soul [[H5315]] lives, [[H2416]] I will not [[H518]] do [[H6213]] such a thing! [[H1697]]

###### 12
“Stay [[H3427]] here [[H2088]] one more day,” [[H3117]] David [[H1732]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Uriah, [[H223]] “and tomorrow [[H4279]] I will send you back.” [[H7971]] So Uriah [[H223]] stayed [[H3427]] in Jerusalem [[H3389]] that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] and the next. [[H4283]]

###### 13
Then David [[H1732]] invited [[H7121]] Uriah to eat [[H398]] and drink [[H8354]] with him, [[H6440]] and he got [Uriah] drunk. [[H7937]] And in the evening [[H6153]] he went out [[H3318]] to lie down [[H7901]] on his cot [[H4904]] with [[H5973]] his master’s [[H113]] servants, [[H5650]] but he did not [[H3808]] go [[H3381]] home. [[H1004]]

###### 14
The next morning [[H1242]] David [[H1732]] wrote [[H3789]] a letter [[H5612]] to [[H413]] Joab [[H3097]] and sent [[H7971]] it with Uriah. [[H223]]

###### 15
In the letter [[H5612]] he wrote: [[H3789]] “Put [[H3051]] Uriah [[H223]] at [[H413]] the front [[H4136]] of the fiercest [[H2389]] battle; [[H4421]] then withdraw [[H7725]] from him, [[H310]] so that he may be struck down [[H5221]] and die.” [[H4191]]

###### 16
So as [[H1961]] Joab [[H3097]] besieged [[H8104]] the city, [[H5892]] he assigned [[H5414]] Uriah [[H223]] to [[H413]] a place [[H4725]] where [[H834]] he saw [[H3045]] the strongest enemy soldiers. [[H376]]

###### 17
And when the men [[H582]] of the city [[H5892]] came out [[H3318]] and fought [[H3898]] against [[H854]] Joab, [[H3097]] some of [[H4480]] David’s [[H1732]] servants [[H5650]] fell, [[H5307]] and Uriah [[H223]] the Hittite [[H2850]] also [[H1571]] died. [[H4191]]

###### 18
Joab [[H3097]] sent [[H7971]] to David [[H1732]] a full account [[H3605]] of the battle [[H4421]]

###### 19
and instructed [[H6680]] the messenger, [[H4397]] “When you have finished [[H3615]] giving [[H1696]] the king [[H4428]] all [[H3605]] the details [[H1697]] of the battle, [[H4421]]

###### 20
if [[H518]] the king’s [[H4428]] anger [[H2534]] flares, [[H5927]] he may ask you, [[H559]] ‘Why [[H4069]] did you get so close [[H5066]] to [[H413]] the city [[H5892]] to fight? [[H3898]] Did you not [[H3808]] realize [[H3045]] they would shoot [[H3384]] from atop [[H5921]] the wall? [[H2346]]

###### 21
Who [was the one] [[H4310]] to strike [[H5221]] Abimelech [[H40]] son [[H1121]] of Jerubbesheth? [[H3380]] Was it not [[H3808]] a woman [[H802]] who dropped [[H7993]] an upper millstone [[H6400]] on him [[H5921]] from [[H5921]] the wall, [[H2346]] so that he died [[H4191]] in Thebez? [[H8405]] Why [[H4100]] did you get so close [[H5066]] to [[H413]] the wall?’ [[H2346]] If so, then you are to say, [[H559]] ‘Your servant [[H5650]] Uriah [[H223]] the Hittite [[H2850]] is dead [[H4191]] as well.’ [[H1571]]

###### 22
So the messenger [[H4397]] set out [[H1980]] and reported [[H5046]] to David [[H1732]] all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] Joab [[H3097]] had sent him to say. [[H7971]]

###### 23
The messenger [[H4397]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] David, [[H1732]] “The men [[H376]] overpowered us [[H1396]] and came out [[H3318]] against [[H413]] us in the field, [[H7704]] but we drove them back [[H1961]] to [[H5704]] the entrance [[H6607]] of the gate. [[H8179]]

###### 24
Then the archers [[H3372]] shot [[H3372]] at [[H413]] your servants [[H5650]] from [[H5921]] the wall, [[H2346]] and some of the king’s [[H4428]] servants [[H5650]] were killed. [[H4191]] And your servant [[H5650]] Uriah [[H223]] the Hittite [[H2850]] is dead [[H4191]] as well.” [[H1571]]

###### 25
Then David [[H1732]] told [[H559]] the messenger, [[H4397]] “Say [[H559]] this [[H3541]] to [[H413]] Joab: [[H3097]] ‘Do not [[H408]] let this [[H2088]] matter [[H1697]] upset [[H7489]] you, [[H5869]] for [[H3588]] the sword [[H2719]] devours [[H398]] one [[H2088]] as well as another. [[H2090]] Strengthen [[H2388]] your attack [[H4421]] against [[H413]] the city [[H5892]] and demolish it. [[H2040]] Encourage him [with these words]. [[H2388]]

###### 26
When Uriah’s [[H223]] wife [[H802]] heard [[H8085]] that [[H3588]] her husband [[H376]] was dead, [[H4191]] she mourned [[H5594]] for [[H5921]] him. [[H1167]]

###### 27
And when the [time of] mourning [[H60]] was over, [[H5674]] David [[H1732]] had her brought [[H622]] to [[H413]] his house, [[H1004]] and she became [[H1961]] his  wife [[H802]] and bore [[H3205]] him  a son. [[H1121]] But the thing [[H1697]] that [[H834]] David [[H1732]] had done [[H6213]] was evil [[H7489]] in the sight [[H5869]] of the LORD. [[H3068]]
