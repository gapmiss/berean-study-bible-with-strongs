###### 1
When David [[H1732]] had gone [[H5674]] a little [[H4592]] beyond the summit, [[H7218]] Ziba [[H6717]] the servant [[H5288]] of  Mephibosheth [[H4648]] was there [[H2009]] to meet him. [[H7122]] He had a pair [[H6776]] of saddled [[H2280]] donkeys [[H2543]] loaded with [[H5921]] two hundred [loaves] [[H3967]] of bread, [[H3899]] a hundred [[H3967]] clusters of raisins, [[H6778]] a hundred [[H3967]] summer fruits, [[H7019]] and a skin [[H5035]] of wine. [[H3196]]

###### 2
“Why [[H4100]] do you have these?” [[H428]] said [[H559]] the king [[H4428]] to [[H413]] Ziba. [[H6717]] Ziba [[H6717]] replied, [[H559]] “The donkeys [[H2543]] are for the king’s [[H4428]] household [[H1004]] to ride, [[H7392]] the bread [[H3899]] and summer fruit [[H7019]] are for the young men [[H5288]] to eat, [[H398]] and the wine [[H3196]] is to refresh those [[H8354]] who become exhausted [[H3287]] in the wilderness.” [[H4057]]

###### 3
“Where [[H346]] is your master’s [[H113]] grandson?” [[H1121]] asked [[H559]] the king. [[H4428]] And Ziba [[H6717]] answered, [[H559]] “Indeed, [[H2009]] he is staying [[H3427]] in Jerusalem, [[H3389]] for [[H3588]] he has said, [[H559]] ‘Today, [[H3117]] the house [[H1004]] of Israel [[H3478]] will restore [[H7725]] to me  the kingdom [[H4468]] of my grandfather.’” [[H1]]

###### 4
So the king [[H4428]] said [[H559]] to Ziba, [[H6717]] “All [[H3605]] that [belongs] [[H834]] to Mephibosheth [[H4648]] is now yours!” [[H2009]] “I humbly bow before you,” [[H7812]] said [[H559]] Ziba. [[H6717]] “May I find [[H4672]] favor [[H2580]] in your eyes, [[H5869]] my lord [[H113]] the king!” [[H4428]]

###### 5
As King [[H4428]] David [[H1732]] approached [[H935]] Bahurim, [[H980]] a man [[H376]] from the family [[H4940]] of the house [[H1004]] of Saul [[H7586]] was just [[H2009]] coming out. [[H3318]] His name [[H8034]] was Shimei [[H8096]] son [[H1121]] of Gera, [[H1617]] and as he approached, [[H3318]] he kept yelling out curses. [[H7043]]

###### 6
He threw stones [[H5619]] at David [[H1732]] and at all [[H3605]] the servants [[H5650]] of the king, [[H4428]] though the troops [[H5971]] and all [[H3605]] the mighty men [were] [[H1368]] on David’s [[H1732]] right [[H3225]] and left. [[H8040]]

###### 7
And as [[H3541]] he yelled curses, [[H7043]] Shimei [[H8096]] said, [[H559]] “Get out, [[H3318]] get out, [[H3318]] you worthless [[H1100]] man [[H376]] of bloodshed! [[H1818]]

###### 8
The LORD [[H3068]] has paid you back [[H7725]] for all [[H3605]] the blood [[H1818]] of the house [[H1004]] of Saul, [[H7586]] in whose [[H834]] place [[H8478]] you have reigned, [[H4427]] and the LORD [[H3068]] has handed the kingdom [[H4410]] over to [[H5414]] your son [[H1121]] Absalom. [[H53]] See, [[H2005]] you have come to ruin [[H7451]] because [[H3588]] you are [[H859]] a man [[H376]] of bloodshed! [[H1818]]

###### 9
Then Abishai [[H52]] son [[H1121]] of Zeruiah [[H6870]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] the king, [[H4428]] “Why [[H4100]] should this [[H2088]] dead [[H4191]] dog [[H3611]] curse [[H7043]] my lord [[H113]] the king? [[H4428]] Let me go over [[H5674]] and cut off his head!” [[H7218]]

###### 10
But the king [[H4428]] replied, [[H559]] “What [[H4100]] have I  to do with you,  O sons [[H1121]] of Zeruiah? [[H6870]] If [[H3588]] he curses me [[H7043]] because [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] told him, [[H559]] ‘Curse [[H7043]] David,’ [[H1732]] who [[H4310]] can ask, [[H559]] ‘Why [[H4069]] did you do [[H6213]] this?’” [[H3651]]

###### 11
Then David [[H1732]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Abishai [[H52]] and all [[H3605]] his servants, [[H5650]] “Behold, [[H2009]] my own son, [[H1121]] my own flesh and blood, [[H4578]] seeks [[H1245]] my life. [[H5315]] How much more, [[H3588]] then, [[H6258]] [this] Benjamite! [[H1145]] Leave him alone [[H3240]] and let him curse me, [[H7043]] for the LORD [[H3068]] has told [[H559]] him  so. [[H3588]]

###### 12
Perhaps [[H194]] the LORD [[H3068]] will see [[H7200]] my affliction [[H5771]] and repay [[H7725]] me  with good [[H2896]] for [[H8478]] the cursing [I receive] [[H7045]] today.” [[H3117]]

###### 13
So David [[H1732]] and his men [[H376]] proceeded [[H1980]] along the road [[H1870]] as Shimei [[H8096]] went [[H1980]] along the ridge [[H6763]] of the hill [[H2022]] opposite him. [[H5980]] As Shimei went, [[H1980]] he yelled curses, [[H7043]] threw stones, [[H5619]] and flung [[H6080]] dust [[H6083]] at [David]. [[H5980]]

###### 14
Finally, the king [[H4428]] and all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] with him [[H854]] arrived, [[H935]] exhausted. [[H5889]] And there [[H8033]] he refreshed himself. [[H5314]]

###### 15
Then Absalom [[H53]] and all [[H3605]] the men [[H376]] of Israel [[H3478]] came [[H935]] to Jerusalem, [[H3389]] and Ahithophel [was] [[H302]] with him. [[H854]]

###### 16
And [[H1961]] David’s [[H1732]] friend [[H7463]] Hushai [[H2365]] the Archite [[H757]] went [[H935]] to [[H413]] Absalom [[H53]] and said [[H559]] to [[H413]] [him], [[H53]] “Long live [[H2421]] the king! [[H4428]] Long live [[H2421]] the king!” [[H4428]]

###### 17
“Is this [[H2088]] the loyalty [[H2617]] [you show] [[H854]] your friend?” [[H7453]] Absalom [[H53]] replied. [[H559]] “Why [[H4100]] did you not [[H3808]] go [[H1980]] with [[H854]] your friend?” [[H7453]]

###### 18
“Not at all,” [[H3808]] Hushai [[H2365]] answered. [[H559]] “For [[H3588]] the one [[H834]] chosen [[H977]] by the LORD, [[H3068]] by the [[H2088]] people, [[H5971]] and by all [[H3605]] the men [[H376]] of Israel— [[H3478]] his [[H3808]] I will be, [[H1961]] and with him [[H854]] I will remain. [[H3427]]

###### 19
Furthermore, [[H8145]] whom [[H4310]] should I [[H589]] serve [[H5647]] if not [[H3808]] the son? [[H1121]] As [[H834]] I served [[H5647]] in your father’s [[H1]] presence, [[H6440]] so also [[H3651]] I will serve [[H1961]] in yours.” [[H6440]]

###### 20
Then Absalom [[H53]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Ahithophel, [[H302]] “Give me [[H3051]] counsel. [[H6098]] What [[H4100]] should we do?” [[H6213]]

###### 21
Ahithophel [[H302]] replied, [[H559]] “Sleep with [[H935]] your father’s [[H1]] concubines [[H6370]] whom [[H834]] he has left [[H3240]] to keep [[H8104]] the palace. [[H1004]] When all [[H3605]] Israel [[H3478]] hears [[H8085]] that [[H3588]] you have become a stench [[H887]] to [[H854]] your father, [[H1]] then the hands [[H3027]] of all [[H3605]] who are [[H834]] with you [[H854]] will be strengthened. [[H2388]]

###### 22
So they pitched [[H5186]] a tent [[H168]] for Absalom [[H53]] on [[H5921]] the roof, [[H1406]] and he [[H53]] slept with [[H935]] his father’s [[H1]] concubines [[H6370]] in the sight [[H5869]] of all [[H3605]] Israel. [[H3478]]

###### 23
Now in those [[H1992]] days [[H3117]] the advice [[H6098]] of Ahithophel [[H302]] was like [[H834]] the consultation [[H7592]] of the word [[H1697]] of God. [[H430]] Such [[H3651]] was the regard [[H3605]] that both [[H1571]] David [[H1732]] and [[H1571]] Absalom [[H53]] had for Ahithophel’s [[H302]] advice. [[H6098]]
