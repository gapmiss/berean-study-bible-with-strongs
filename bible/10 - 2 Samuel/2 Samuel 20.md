###### 1
Now a worthless [[H1100]] man [[H376]] named [[H8034]] Sheba [[H7652]] son [[H1121]] of Bichri, [[H1075]] a Benjamite, [[H3228]] happened [[H7122]] to be there, [[H8033]] and he blew [[H8628]] the ram’s horn [[H7782]] and shouted: [[H559]] “We have no [[H369]] share [[H2506]] in David, [[H1732]] no [[H3808]] inheritance [[H5159]] in Jesse’s [[H3448]] son. [[H1121]] Every man [[H376]] to his tent, [[H168]] O Israel! [[H3478]]

###### 2
So all [[H3605]] the men [[H376]] of Israel [[H3478]] deserted [[H5927]] David [[H1732]] to follow [[H310]] Sheba [[H7652]] son [[H1121]] of Bichri. [[H1075]] But the men [[H376]] of Judah [[H3063]] stayed by [[H1692]] their king [[H4428]] all the way [[H5704]] from the Jordan [[H3383]] to Jerusalem. [[H3389]]

###### 3
When David [[H1732]] returned [[H935]] to [[H413]] his palace [[H1004]] in Jerusalem, [[H3389]] he [[H4428]] took [[H3947]] the ten [[H6235]] concubines [[H6370]] he had left [[H3240]] to care for [[H8104]] the palace [[H1004]] and placed [[H5414]] them under guard. [[H4931]] He provided for them, [[H3557]] but he no longer [[H3808]] slept with [[H413]] them. [[H935]] They were [[H1961]] confined [[H6887]] until [[H5704]] the day [[H3117]] of their death, [[H4194]] living [[H2424]] as widows. [[H491]]

###### 4
Then the king [[H4428]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Amasa, [[H6021]] “Summon [[H2199]] the men [[H376]] of Judah [[H3063]] to come to me  within three [[H7969]] days, [[H3117]] and be here [[H6311]] yourself.” [[H859]]

###### 5
So Amasa [[H6021]] went [[H1980]] to summon [[H2199]] Judah, [[H3063]] but he took longer [[H309]] than [[H4480]] the time [[H4150]] allotted him. [[H3259]]

###### 6
And David [[H1732]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Abishai, [[H52]] “Now [[H6258]] Sheba [[H7652]] the son [[H1121]] of Bichri [[H1075]] will do us more harm [[H3415]] than [[H4480]] Absalom. [[H53]] Take [[H3947]] your lord’s [[H113]] servants [[H5650]] and pursue him, [[H7291]] or [[H6435]] he will secure [[H4672]] fortified [[H1219]] cities [[H5892]] and elude [[H5337]] us. [[H5869]]

###### 7
So Joab’s [[H3097]] men, [[H376]] along with the Cherethites, [[H3774]] the Pelethites, [[H6432]] and all [[H3605]] the mighty men, [[H1368]] marched out of [[H3318]] Jerusalem [[H3389]] in pursuit [[H7291]] of Sheba [[H7652]] son [[H1121]] of Bichri. [[H1075]]

###### 8
[And while] they [[H1992]] were at [[H5973]] the great [[H1419]] stone [[H68]] in Gibeon, [[H1391]] Amasa [[H6021]] joined [[H935]] them. [[H6440]] Now Joab [[H3097]] was dressed [[H2296]] in military attire, [[H4055]] and over [[H5921]] it was a belt [[H2290]] around [[H5921]] his waist [[H4975]] with a dagger [[H2719]] in its sheath. [[H8593]] As he [[H1931]] stepped forward, [[H3318]] the sword fell out. [[H5307]]

###### 9
“Are you [[H859]] well, [[H7965]] my brother?” [[H251]] Joab [[H3097]] asked [[H559]] Amasa. [[H6021]] And with his right [[H3225]] hand [[H3027]] Joab [[H3097]] grabbed [[H270]] Amasa [[H6021]] by the beard [[H2206]] to kiss [[H5401]] him. 

###### 10
Amasa [[H6021]] was not [[H3808]] on guard [[H8104]] against the dagger [[H2719]] in Joab’s [[H3097]] hand, [[H3027]] and Joab stabbed [[H5221]] him in [[H413]] the stomach [[H2570]] and spilled out his intestines [[H4578]] on the ground. [[H776]] And Joab did not need [[H3808]] to strike him again, [[H8138]] for Amasa was dead. [[H4191]] Then Joab [[H3097]] and his brother [[H251]] Abishai [[H52]] pursued [[H7291]] Sheba [[H7652]] son [[H1121]] of Bichri. [[H1075]]

###### 11
One [[H376]] of Joab's [[H3097]] young men [[H5288]] stood [[H5976]] near Amasa [[H5921]] and said, [[H559]] “Whoever [[H4310]] favors [[H2654]] Joab, [[H3097]] and whoever [[H4310]] is for David, [[H1732]] [let him] follow [[H310]] Joab!” [[H3097]]

###### 12
But Amasa [[H6021]] wallowed [[H1556]] in his blood [[H1818]] in the middle [[H8432]] of the road, [[H4546]] and when the man [[H376]] saw [[H7200]] that all [[H3605]] the troops [[H5971]] were stopping there, [[H5975]] he dragged [[H5437]] [the body] [[H6021]] off [[H4480]] the road [[H4546]] into a field [[H7704]] and threw [[H7993]] a garment [[H899]] over it. [[H5921]]

###### 13
As soon as [[H834]] [Amasa's body] was removed [[H3014]] from [[H4480]] the road, [[H4546]] all [[H3605]] the men [[H376]] went on [[H5674]] with [[H310]] Joab [[H3097]] to pursue [[H7291]] Sheba [[H7652]] son [[H1121]] of Bichri. [[H1075]]

###### 14
Sheba passed [[H5674]] through all [[H3605]] the tribes [[H7626]] of Israel [[H3478]] toward Abel-Beth-Maacah, [[H59]] through the entire [[H3605]] [region of] the Berites, [[H1276]] who gathered together [[H7035]] and followed [[H935]] him. [[H310]]

###### 15
And Joab’s troops came [[H935]] and besieged [[H6696]] [Sheba] [[H5921]] in Abel-Beth-Maacah [[H59]] and built [[H8210]] a siege ramp [[H5550]] against the outer rampart [[H2426]] of the city. [[H5892]] As all [[H3605]] the troops [[H5971]] with [[H854]] Joab [[H3097]] were battering [[H7843]] the wall [[H2346]] to topple it, [[H5307]]

###### 16
a wise [[H2450]] woman [[H802]] called out [[H7121]] from [[H4480]] the city, [[H5892]] “Listen! [[H8085]] Listen! [[H8085]] Please [[H4994]] tell [[H559]] Joab [[H3097]] to come [[H7126]] here [[H2008]] so that I may speak [[H1696]] with him.” [[H413]]

###### 17
When he had come near [[H7126]] to her, [[H413]] the woman [[H802]] asked, [[H559]] “Are you [[H859]] Joab?” [[H3097]] “I [am],” [[H589]] he replied. [[H559]] “Listen [[H8085]] to the words [[H1697]] of your servant,” [[H519]] she said. [[H559]] “I am [[H595]] listening,” [[H8085]] he answered. [[H559]]

###### 18
Then [the woman] said, [[H559]] “Long ago [[H7223]] they used to say, [[H1696]] ‘Seek counsel [[H7592]] at Abel,’ [[H59]] and that is how [[H3651]] disputes were settled. [[H8552]]

###### 19
I [am] [[H595]] [among the] peaceable [[H7999]] [and] faithful [[H539]] in Israel, [[H3478]] but you are [[H859]] trying [[H1245]] to destroy [[H4191]] a city [[H5892]] that is a mother [[H517]] in Israel. [[H3478]] Why [[H4100]] would you swallow up [[H1104]] the LORD’s [[H3068]] inheritance?” [[H5159]]

###### 20
“Far be it!” [[H2486]] Joab [[H3097]] declared. [[H559]] “Far be it [[H2486]] from me  to [[H518]] swallow up [[H1104]] or [[H518]] destroy! [[H7843]]

###### 21
That [is] [[H1697]] not [[H3808]] the case. [[H3651]] But [[H3588]] a man [[H376]] named [[H8034]] Sheba [[H7652]] son [[H1121]] of Bichri, [[H1075]] from the hill country [[H2022]] of Ephraim, [[H669]] has lifted [[H5375]] up his hand [[H3027]] against the king, [[H4428]] against David. [[H1732]] Deliver [[H5414]] him [[H853]] alone, [[H905]] and I will depart [[H1980]] from [[H5921]] the city. [[H5892]] Look, [[H2009]] the woman [[H802]] replied, [[H559]] his head [[H7218]] will be thrown [[H7993]] to you [[H413]] over [[H1157]] the wall. [[H2346]]

###### 22
Then the woman [[H802]] went [[H935]] to [[H413]] all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] with her wise counsel, [[H2451]] and they cut off [[H3772]] the head [[H7218]] of Sheba [[H7652]] son [[H1121]] of Bichri [[H1075]] and threw [[H7993]] it to [[H413]] Joab. [[H3097]] So he blew [[H8628]] the trumpet [[H7782]] and [his men] dispersed [[H6327]] from [[H5921]] the city, [[H5892]] each [[H376]] to his own home. [[H168]] And Joab [[H3097]] returned [[H7725]] to [[H413]] the king [[H4428]] in Jerusalem. [[H3389]]

###### 23
Now Joab [[H3097]] was over [[H413]] the whole [[H3605]] army [[H6635]] of Israel; [[H3478]] Benaiah [[H1141]] son [[H1121]] of Jehoiada [[H3077]] was over [[H5921]] the Cherethites [[H3746]] and [[H5921]] Pelethites; [[H6432]]

###### 24
Adoniram [[H151]] was in charge of [[H5921]] forced labor; [[H4522]] Jehoshaphat [[H3092]] son [[H1121]] of Ahilud [[H286]] was the recorder; [[H2142]]

###### 25
Sheva [[H7724]] was the scribe; [[H5608]] Zadok [[H6659]] and Abiathar [[H54]] were priests; [[H3548]]

###### 26
and [[H1571]] Ira [[H5896]] the Jairite [[H2972]] was [[H1961]] David’s [[H1732]] priest. [[H3548]]
