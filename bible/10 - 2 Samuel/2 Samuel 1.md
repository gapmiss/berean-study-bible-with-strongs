###### 1
After [[H310]] the death [[H4191]] of Saul, [[H7586]] David [[H1732]] returned [[H7725]] from the slaughter [[H5221]] of the Amalekites [[H6002]] and stayed [[H3427]] in Ziklag [[H6860]] two [[H8147]] days. [[H3117]]

###### 2
On the third [[H7992]] day [[H3117]] a man [[H376]] with torn [[H7167]] clothes [[H899]] and dust [[H127]] on [[H5921]] his head [[H7218]] arrived [[H935]] from [[H4480]] Saul’s [[H7586]] camp. [[H4264]] When he came [[H935]] to [[H413]] David, [[H1732]] he fell [[H5307]] to the ground [[H776]] to pay him homage. [[H7812]]

###### 3
“Where [[H335]] have you come from?” [[H935]] David [[H1732]] asked. [[H559]] “I have escaped [[H4422]] from the Israelite [[H3478]] camp,” [[H4264]] he replied. [[H559]]

###### 4
“What [[H4100]] was the outcome?” [[H1961]] David [[H1732]] asked. [[H559]] “Please [[H4994]] tell me.” [[H5046]] “The troops [[H5971]] fled [[H5127]] from [[H4480]] the battle,” [[H4421]] he replied. [[H559]] “Many [[H7235]] of [[H4480]] [them] [[H5971]] fell [[H5307]] and died. [[H4191]] And [[H1571]] Saul [[H7586]] and his son [[H1121]] Jonathan [[H3083]] are also dead.” [[H4191]]

###### 5
David [[H1732]] asked [[H559]] the young man [[H5288]] who had brought him the report, [[H5046]] “How [[H349]] do you know [[H3045]] Saul [[H7586]] and his son [[H1121]] Jonathan [[H3083]] are dead?” [[H4191]]

###### 6
“I happened [[H7122]] to be on Mount [[H2022]] Gilboa,” [[H1533]] he [[H5288]] replied, [[H559]] “and there [[H2009]] was Saul, [[H7586]] leaning [[H8172]] on [[H5921]] his spear, [[H2595]] with [[H2009]] the chariots [[H7393]] and the cavalry [[H6571]] closing in on him. [[H1692]]

###### 7
When he turned around [[H6437]] and saw me, [[H7200]] he called out [[H7121]] and I answered, [[H559]] ‘Here I am!’ [[H2005]]

###### 8
‘Who [[H4310]] are you?’ [[H859]] he asked. [[H559]] So I told [[H559]] him, [[H413]] ‘I am [[H595]] an Amalekite.’ [[H6003]]

###### 9
Then he begged me, [[H559]] ‘Stand [[H5975]] over [[H5921]] me and kill me, [[H4191]] for [[H3588]] agony [[H7661]] has seized me [[H270]] but [[H3588]] my life [[H5315]] still [[H3605]] lingers.’ [[H5750]]

###### 10
So I stood [[H5975]] over [[H5921]] him and killed him, [[H4191]] because [[H3588]] I knew [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] after [[H310]] he had fallen [[H5307]] he could not [[H3808]] survive. [[H2421]] And I took [[H3947]] the crown [[H5145]] that [[H834]] was on [[H5921]] his head [[H7218]] and the band [[H685]] that [[H834]] was on [[H5921]] his arm, [[H2220]] and I have brought [[H935]] them here [[H2008]] to [[H413]] my lord. [[H113]]

###### 11
Then David [[H1732]] took hold [[H2388]] of his clothes [[H899]] and tore them, [[H7167]] and all [[H3605]] the men [[H376]] who [were] [[H834]] with him [[H854]] did the same. [[H1571]]

###### 12
They mourned [[H5594]] and wept [[H1058]] and fasted [[H6684]] until [[H5704]] evening [[H6153]] for [[H5921]] Saul [[H7586]] and [[H5921]] his son [[H1121]] Jonathan, [[H3083]] and for the people [[H5971]] of the LORD [[H3069]] and the house [[H1004]] of Israel, [[H3478]] because [[H3588]] they had fallen [[H5307]] by the sword. [[H2719]]

###### 13
And David [[H1732]] inquired [[H559]] of [[H413]] the young man [[H5288]] who had brought him the report, [[H5046]] “Where [[H335]] are you from?” [[H859]] “I am the son [[H1121]] of a foreigner,” [[H1616]] he answered. [[H559]] “I am [[H595]] an Amalekite.” [[H6003]]

###### 14
So David [[H1732]] asked [[H559]] him, [[H413]] “Why [[H349]] were you not [[H3808]] afraid [[H3372]] to lift [[H7971]] your hand [[H3027]] to destroy [[H7843]] the LORD’s [[H3068]] anointed?” [[H4899]]

###### 15
Then David [[H1732]] summoned [[H7121]] one [[H259]] of the young men [[H5288]] and said, [[H559]] “Go, [[H5066]] execute him!” [[H6293]] So he struck him down, [[H5221]] and he died. [[H4191]]

###### 16
For David [[H1732]] had said [[H559]] to the Amalekite, [[H413]] “Your blood [[H1818]] [be] on [[H5921]] your own head [[H7218]] because [[H3588]] your own mouth [[H6310]] testified [[H6030]] against you,  saying, [[H559]] ‘I [[H595]] killed [[H4191]] the LORD’s [[H3068]] anointed.’” [[H4899]]

###### 17
Then David [[H1732]] took up [[H6969]] this [[H2063]] lament [[H7015]] for [[H5921]] Saul [[H7586]] and his son [[H1121]] Jonathan, [[H3083]]

###### 18
and he ordered [[H559]] that the sons [[H1121]] of Judah [[H3063]] be taught [[H3925]] [the Song of] the Bow. [[H7198]] It is written [[H3789]] in [[H5921]] the Book [[H5612]] of Jashar: [[H3477]]

###### 19
“Your glory, [[H6643]] O Israel, [[H3478]] lies slain [[H2491]] on [[H5921]] your heights. [[H1116]] How [[H349]] the mighty [[H1368]] have fallen! [[H5307]]

###### 20
Tell [it] [[H5046]] not [[H408]] in Gath; [[H1661]] proclaim [it] [[H1319]] not [[H408]] in the streets [[H2351]] of Ashkelon, [[H831]] lest [[H6435]] the daughters [[H1323]] of the Philistines [[H6430]] rejoice, [[H8055]] and the daughters [[H1323]] of the uncircumcised [[H6189]] exult. [[H5937]]

###### 21
O mountains [[H2022]] of Gilboa, [[H1533]] may you have [[H5921]] no [[H408]] dew [[H2919]] or rain, [[H4306]] no fields [[H7704]] [yielding] offerings [of grain]. [[H8641]] For [[H3588]] there [[H8033]] the shield [[H4043]] of the mighty [[H1368]] was defiled, [[H1602]] the shield [[H4043]] of Saul, [[H7586]] no longer [[H1097]] anointed [[H4899]] with oil. [[H8081]]

###### 22
From the blood [[H1818]] of the slain, [[H2491]] from the fat [[H2459]] of the mighty, [[H1368]] the bow [[H7198]] of Jonathan [[H3083]] did not [[H3808]] retreat, [[H7734]] and the sword [[H2719]] of Saul [[H7586]] did not [[H3808]] return [[H7725]] empty. [[H7387]]

###### 23
Saul [[H7586]] and Jonathan, [[H3083]] beloved [[H157]] and delightful [[H5273]] in life, [[H2416]] were not [[H3808]] divided [[H6504]] in death. [[H4194]] They were swifter [[H7043]] than eagles, [[H5404]] they were stronger [[H1396]] than lions. [[H738]]

###### 24
O daughters [[H1323]] of Israel, [[H3478]] weep [[H1058]] for [[H413]] Saul, [[H7586]] who clothed you [[H3847]] in scarlet [[H8144]] and [[H5973]] luxury, [[H5730]] who decked [[H5927]] your garments [[H3830]] with [[H5921]] ornaments [[H5716]] of gold. [[H2091]]

###### 25
How [[H349]] the mighty [[H1368]] have fallen [[H5307]] in the thick [[H8432]] of battle! [[H4421]] Jonathan [[H3083]] lies slain [[H2491]] on [[H5921]] your heights. [[H1116]]

###### 26
I grieve [[H6887]] for you, [[H5921]] Jonathan, [[H3083]] my brother. [[H251]] You were delightful [[H5276]] to me;  your love [[H160]] to me  was extraordinary, [[H6381]] surpassing the love [[H160]] of women. [[H802]]

###### 27
How [[H349]] the mighty [[H1368]] have fallen [[H5307]] and the weapons [[H3627]] of war [[H4421]] have perished!” [[H6]]
