### 1
Then the LORD [[H3068]] sent [[H7971]] Nathan [[H5416]] to [[H413]] David, [[H1732]] and when he arrived, [[H935]] he said, [[H559]] “There were [[H1961]] two [[H8147]] men [[H582]] in a certain [[H259]] city, [[H5892]] one [[H259]] rich [[H6223]] and the other [[H259]] poor. [[H7326]]

### 2
The rich [[H6223]] man had [[H1961]] a great number of [[H7235]] sheep [[H6629]] and cattle, [[H1241]]

### 3
but the poor [[H7326]] man had nothing [[H369]] except [[H3588]] one [[H259]] small [[H6996]] ewe lamb [[H3535]] that [[H834]] he had bought. [[H7069]] He raised it, [[H2421]] and it grew up [[H1431]] with him [[H5973]] and his children. [[H1121]] It shared [[H3162]] his food [[H6595]] and drank [[H8354]] from his cup; [[H3563]] it slept [[H7901]] in his arms [[H2436]] and was [[H1961]] like a daughter [[H1323]] to him. 

### 4
Now a traveler [[H1982]] came [[H935]] to the rich [[H6223]] man, [[H376]] who refrained from taking [[H3947]] one of his own sheep [[H6629]] or cattle [[H1241]] to prepare [[H6213]] for the traveler [[H732]] who had come [[H935]] to him.  Instead, he took [[H3947]] the poor [[H7326]] man’s [[H376]] lamb [[H3535]] and prepared it [[H6213]] for his guest.” [[H376]]

### 5
David [[H1732]] burned [[H2734]] with anger [[H639]] against the man [[H376]] and said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Nathan: [[H5416]] “As surely as the LORD [[H3068]] lives, [[H2416]] the man [[H376]] who did [[H6213]] this [[H2063]] deserves to die! [[H4194]]

### 6
Because [[H6118]] he has done [[H6213]] this [[H2088]] thing [[H1697]] and shown no [[H3808]] pity, [[H2550]] he must pay [[H7999]] for the lamb [[H3535]] four times over.” [[H706]]

### 7
Then Nathan [[H5416]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] David, [[H1732]] “You [[H859]] are that man! [[H376]] This is what [[H3541]] the LORD, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] says: [[H559]] ‘I [[H595]] anointed [[H4886]] you king [[H4428]] over [[H5921]] Israel, [[H3478]] and I [[H595]] delivered you [[H5337]] from the hand [[H3027]] of Saul. [[H7586]]

### 8
I gave [[H5414]] your master’s [[H113]] house to you [[H1004]] and your master’s [[H113]] wives [[H802]] into your arms. [[H2436]] I gave [[H5414]] you  the house [[H1004]] of Israel [[H3478]] and Judah, [[H3063]] and if [[H518]] that was not enough, [[H4592]] I would have given [[H3254]] you  even more. [[H2007]]

### 9
Why [[H4069]] then have you despised [[H959]] the command [[H1697]] of the LORD [[H3068]] by doing [[H6213]] evil [[H7451]] in His sight? [[H5869]] You struck down [[H5221]] Uriah [[H223]] the Hittite [[H2850]] with the sword [[H2719]] and took [[H3947]] his wife [[H802]] as your own, [[H802]] for you have slain him [[H2026]] with the sword [[H2719]] of the Ammonites. [[H1121]]

### 10
Now, therefore, [[H6258]] the sword [[H2719]] will never [[H3808]] depart [[H5493]] from your house, [[H1004]] because [[H6118]] you have despised Me [[H959]] and have taken [[H3947]] the wife [[H802]] of Uriah [[H223]] the Hittite [[H2850]] to be [[H1961]] your own.’ [[H802]]

### 11
This is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] says: [[H559]] ‘I will raise up [[H6965]] adversity [[H7451]] against you [[H5921]] from your own house. [[H1004]] Before your very eyes [[H5869]] I will take [[H3947]] your wives [[H802]] and give [[H5414]] them to another, [[H7453]] and he will lie [[H7901]] with them [[H5973]] in broad daylight. [[H802]]

### 12
You [[H859]] have acted [[H6213]] in secret, [[H5643]] but I [[H589]] will do [[H6213]] this thing [[H2088]] in broad daylight [[H8121]] before [[H5048]] all [[H3605]] Israel.’” [[H3478]]

### 13
Then David [[H1732]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Nathan, [[H5416]] “I have sinned [[H2398]] against the LORD.” [[H3068]] “The LORD [[H3068]] has taken away [[H5674]] your sin,” [[H2403]] Nathan [[H5416]] replied. [[H559]] “You will not [[H3808]] die. [[H4191]]

### 14
Nevertheless, [[H657]] because [[H3588]] by [[H2088]] this deed [[H1697]] you have treated [[H5006]] the LORD [[H3068]] with utter contempt, [[H5006]] the son [[H1121]] born [[H3209]] to you  will surely [[H4191]] die.” [[H4191]]

### 15
After Nathan [[H5416]] had gone [[H1980]] home, [[H1004]] the LORD [[H3068]] struck [[H5062]] the child [[H3206]] that [[H834]] Uriah’s [[H223]] wife [[H802]] had borne [[H3205]] to David, [[H1732]] and he became ill. [[H605]]

### 16
David [[H1732]] pleaded [[H1245]] with God [[H430]] for [[H1157]] the boy. [[H5288]] He [[H1732]] fasted [[H6684]] and went into his house [[H935]] and spent the night [[H3885]] lying [in sackcloth] [[H7901]] on the ground. [[H776]]

### 17
The elders [[H2205]] of his household [[H1004]] stood [[H6965]] beside him [[H5921]] to help him up [[H6965]] from [[H4480]] the ground, [[H776]] but he was unwilling [[H3808]] and would not [[H3808]] eat [[H1254]] anything with them. [[H854]]

### 18
On the seventh [[H7637]] day [[H3117]] the child [[H3206]] died. [[H4191]] But David’s [[H1732]] servants [[H5650]] were afraid [[H3372]] to tell [[H5046]] him  that [[H3588]] the child [[H3206]] was dead, [[H4191]] for [[H3588]] they said, [[H559]] “Look, [[H2009]] while the child [[H3206]] was [[H1961]] alive, [[H2416]] we spoke [[H1696]] to him, [[H413]] and he would not [[H3808]] listen to us. [[H8085]] So how [[H349]] can we tell [[H559]] him [[H413]] the child [[H3206]] is dead? [[H4191]] He may even harm himself. [[H6213]]

### 19
When David [[H1732]] saw [[H7200]] that [[H3588]] his servants [[H5650]] were whispering to each other, [[H3907]] he [[H1732]] perceived [[H995]] that [[H3588]] the child [[H3206]] was dead. [[H4191]] So he [[H1732]] asked [[H559]] his servants, [[H5650]] “Is the child [[H3206]] dead?” [[H4191]] “He is dead,” [[H4191]] they replied. [[H559]]

### 20
Then David [[H1732]] got up [[H6965]] from the ground, [[H776]] washed [[H7364]] and anointed himself, [[H5480]] changed [[H2498]] his clothes, [[H8071]] and went into [[H935]] the house [[H1004]] of the LORD [[H3068]] and worshiped. [[H7812]] Then he went [[H935]] to [[H413]] his own house, [[H1004]] and at his request [[H7592]] they set [[H7760]] food [[H3899]] before him,  and he ate. [[H398]]

### 21
“What [is] [[H4100]] this [[H2088]] you have done?” [[H6213]] his servants [[H5650]] asked. [[H559]] “While [[H5668]] the child [[H3206]] was alive, [[H2416]] you fasted [[H6684]] and wept, [[H1058]] but when [[H834]] he [[H3206]] died, [[H4191]] you got up [[H6965]] and ate.” [[H398]]

### 22
[David] answered, [[H559]] “While [[H5750]] the child [[H3206]] was alive, [[H2416]] I fasted [[H6684]] and wept, [[H1058]] for [[H3588]] I said, [[H559]] ‘Who [[H4310]] knows? [[H3045]] The LORD [[H3068]] may be gracious [[H2603]] to me [[H3206]] and let him live.’ [[H2416]]

### 23
But now [[H6258]] that he is dead, [[H4191]] why [[H4100]] should I [[H589]] fast? [[H6684]] Can [[H3201]] I bring him back [[H7725]] again? [[H5750]] I will [[H589]] go [[H1980]] to him, [[H413]] but he [[H1931]] will not [[H3808]] return [[H7725]] to me.” [[H413]]

### 24
Then David [[H1732]] comforted [[H5162]] his wife [[H802]] Bathsheba, [[H1339]] and he went [[H935]] to her [[H413]] and lay [[H7901]] with her. [[H5973]] So she gave birth to [[H3205]] a son, [[H1121]] and they named him [[H7121]] Solomon. [[H8010]] Now the LORD [[H3068]] loved [the child] [[H157]]

### 25
and sent [[H7971]] [word] through [[H3027]] Nathan [[H5416]] the prophet [[H5030]] to name him [[H7121]] Jedidiah [[H3041]] because [[H5668]] the LORD [loved him]. [[H3068]]

### 26
Meanwhile, Joab [[H3097]] fought [[H3898]] against Rabbah [[H7237]] of the Ammonites [[H1121]] and captured [[H3920]] the royal [[H4410]] fortress. [[H5892]]

### 27
Then Joab [[H3097]] sent [[H7971]] messengers [[H4397]] to [[H413]] David [[H1732]] to say, [[H559]] “I have fought [[H3898]] against Rabbah [[H7237]] and have also [[H1571]] captured [[H3920]] the water supply. [[H4325]]

### 28
Now, therefore, [[H6258]] assemble [[H622]] the rest [[H3499]] of the troops, [[H5971]] lay siege [[H2583]] to [[H5921]] the city, [[H5892]] and capture it. [[H3920]] Otherwise [[H6435]] I [[H589]] will capture [[H3920]] the city, [[H5892]] and it will be named [[H7121]] after me.” [[H8034]]

### 29
So David [[H1732]] assembled [[H622]] all [[H3605]] the troops [[H5971]] and went [[H1980]] to Rabbah; [[H7237]] and he fought [[H3898]] against it  and captured it. [[H3920]]

### 30
Then he took [[H3947]] the crown [[H5850]] from [[H5921]] the head [[H7218]] of their king. [[H4428]] It weighed [[H4948]] a talent [[H3603]] of gold [[H2091]] and was set with precious [[H3368]] stones, [[H68]] and it was [[H1961]] placed on [[H5921]] David’s [[H1732]] head. [[H7218]] And David took [[H3318]] a great amount [[H7235]] of plunder [[H7998]] from the city. [[H5892]]

### 31
[David] brought out [[H3318]] the people [[H5971]] who [were] [[H834]] there  and put [them to work] [[H7760]] with saws, [[H4050]] iron [[H1270]] picks, [[H2757]] and axes, [[H4037]] and he made them work [[H5674]] at the brick kilns. [[H4404]] He did [[H6213]] the same [[H3651]] to all [[H3605]] the Ammonite [[H1121]] cities. [[H5892]] Then [David] [[H1732]] and all [[H3605]] his troops [[H5971]] returned [[H7725]] to Jerusalem.
