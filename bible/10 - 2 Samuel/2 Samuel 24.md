[[2 Samuel 23|←]] • [[1 Kings 1|→]]

###### 1
Again [[H3254]] the anger [[H639]] of the LORD [[H3068]] burned [[H2734]] against Israel, [[H3478]] and He stirred up [[H5496]] David [[H1732]] against them,  saying, [[H559]] “Go, [[H1980]] take a census [[H4487]] of Israel [[H3478]] and Judah.” [[H3063]]

###### 2
So the king [[H4428]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Joab [[H3097]] the commander [[H8269]] of his army, [[H2428]] who [was] [[H834]] with him, [[H854]] “Go [[H7751]] now [[H4994]] throughout [[H3605]] the tribes [[H7626]] of Israel [[H3478]] from Dan [[H1835]] to [[H5704]] Beersheba [[H884]] and register [[H6485]] the troops, [[H5971]] so that I may know [[H3045]] their number.” [[H4557]]

###### 3
But Joab [[H3097]] replied [[H559]] to [[H413]] the king, [[H4428]] “May the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] multiply [[H3254]] the troops [[H5971]] a hundred [[H3967]] times [[H6471]] over [[H1992]] and may the eyes [[H5869]] of my lord [[H113]] the king [[H4428]] see [it]. [[H7200]] But why [[H4100]] does my lord [[H113]] the king [[H4428]] want [[H2654]] to do such [[H2088]] a thing? [[H1697]]

###### 4
Nevertheless, the king's [[H4428]] word [[H1697]] prevailed [[H2388]] against [[H413]] Joab [[H3097]] and against [[H5921]] the commanders [[H8269]] of the army. [[H2428]] So Joab [[H3097]] and the commanders [[H8269]] of the army [[H2428]] departed [[H3318]] from the presence [[H6440]] of the king [[H4428]] to count [[H6485]] the troops [[H5971]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

###### 5
They crossed [[H5674]] the Jordan [[H3383]] and camped [[H2583]] near Aroer, [[H6177]] south [[H3225]] of the town [[H5892]] in the middle [[H8432]] of the valley, [[H5158]] and proceeded toward Gad [[H1410]] and Jazer. [[H3270]]

###### 6
Then they went [[H935]] to Gilead [[H1568]] and to [[H413]] the land [[H776]] of Tahtim-hodshi [[H8483]] and continued [[H935]] on to Dan-jaan [[H1842]] and around [[H5439]] to [[H413]] Sidon. [[H6721]]

###### 7
They went [[H935]] toward the fortress [[H4013]] of Tyre [[H6865]] and all [[H3605]] the cities [[H5892]] of the Hivites [[H2340]] and Canaanites. [[H3669]] Finally, they went on [[H3318]] to [[H413]] the Negev [[H5045]] of Judah, [[H3063]] [to] Beersheba. [[H884]]

###### 8
At the end [[H7097]] of nine [[H8672]] months [[H2320]] and twenty [[H6242]] days, [[H3117]] having gone [[H7751]] through the whole [[H3605]] land, [[H776]] they returned [[H935]] to Jerusalem. [[H3389]]

###### 9
And Joab [[H3097]] reported [[H5414]] to the king [[H4428]] the total [[H4557]] number [[H4662]] of the troops. [[H5971]] In Israel [[H3478]] there were [[H1961]] 800,000 [[H8083]] valiant warriors [[H376]] who drew [[H8025]] the sword, [[H2719]] and in Judah [[H3063]] there were 500,000. [[H2568]]

###### 10
After [[H310]] [David] had numbered [[H5608]] the troops, [[H5971]] [his] [[H1732]] conscience [[H3820]] was stricken [[H5221]] and he [[H1732]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] the LORD, [[H3068]] “I have sinned [[H2398]] greatly [[H3966]] in what [[H834]] I have done. [[H6213]] Now, [[H6258]] O LORD, [[H3068]] I beg You [[H4994]] to take away [[H5674]] the iniquity [[H5771]] of Your servant, [[H5650]] for [[H3588]] I have acted very [[H3966]] foolishly. [[H5528]]

###### 11
When David [[H1732]] got up [[H6965]] in the morning, [[H1242]] a revelation [[H1697]] from the LORD [[H3068]] had come [[H1961]] to [[H413]] Gad [[H1410]] the prophet, [[H5030]] David’s [[H1732]] seer: [[H2374]]

###### 12
“Go [[H1980]] and tell [[H1696]] David [[H1732]] that this is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] says: [[H559]] ‘I [[H595]] am offering [[H5190]] you three [options]. [[H7969]] Choose [[H977]] one [[H259]] of them, [[H1992]] and I will carry it out [[H6213]] against you.’” 

###### 13
So Gad [[H1410]] went [[H935]] and said [[H5046]] to [[H413]] David, [[H1732]] “Shall you endure [[H935]] three [[H7651]] years [[H8141]] of famine [[H7458]] on your land, [[H776]] or [[H518]] three [[H7969]] months [[H2320]] of fleeing [[H5127]] the pursuit [[H7291]] of [[H6440]] your enemies, [[H6862]] or [[H518]] three [[H7969]] days [[H3117]] of [[H1961]] plague [[H1698]] upon your land? [[H776]] Now then, [[H6258]] think it over [[H3045]] and decide [[H7200]] how [[H4100]] I should reply [[H1697]] to Him who sent me. [[H7971]]

###### 14
David [[H1732]] answered [[H559]] Gad, [[H1410]] “I am  deeply [[H3966]] distressed. [[H6862]] Please, [[H4994]] let us fall [[H5307]] into the hands [[H3027]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] for [[H3588]] His mercies [are] [[H7356]] great; [[H7227]] but do not [[H408]] let me fall [[H5307]] into the hands [[H3027]] of men.” [[H120]]

###### 15
So the LORD [[H3068]] sent [[H5414]] a plague [[H1698]] on Israel [[H3478]] from that morning [[H1242]] until [[H5704]] the appointed [[H4150]] time, [[H6256]] and of [[H4480]] the people [[H5971]] from Dan [[H1835]] to [[H5704]] Beersheba, [[H884]] seventy [[H7657]] thousand [[H505]] men [[H376]] died. [[H4191]]

###### 16
But when the angel [[H4397]] stretched [[H7971]] out his hand [[H3027]] to destroy [[H7843]] Jerusalem, [[H3389]] the LORD [[H3068]] relented [[H5162]] from [[H413]] the calamity [[H7451]] and said [[H559]] to the angel [[H4397]] who was destroying [[H7843]] the people, [[H5971]] “Enough, [[H7227]] withdraw [[H7503]] your hand [[H3027]] now!” [[H6258]] At that time the angel [[H4397]] of the LORD [[H3068]] was [[H1961]] by [[H5973]] the threshing floor [[H1637]] of Araunah [[H728]] the Jebusite. [[H2983]]

###### 17
When David [[H1732]] saw [[H7200]] the angel [[H4397]] striking down [[H5221]] the people, [[H5971]] he said [[H559]] to [[H413]] the LORD, [[H3068]] “Surely [[H2009]] I, [the shepherd], [[H595]] have sinned [[H2398]] and [[H595]] acted wickedly. [[H5753]] But these [[H428]] sheep, [[H6629]] what [[H4100]] have they done? [[H6213]] Please, [[H4994]] let Your hand [[H3027]] fall upon [[H1961]] me  and my fathers [[H1]] house. [[H1004]]

###### 18
And that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] Gad [[H1410]] came [[H935]] to [[H413]] David [[H1732]] and said [[H559]] to him,  “Go up [[H5927]] and build [[H6965]] an altar [[H4196]] to the LORD [[H3068]] on the threshing floor [[H1637]] of Araunah [[H728]] the Jebusite.” [[H2983]]

###### 19
So David [[H1732]] went up [[H5927]] at the word [[H1697]] of Gad, [[H1410]] just as [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] had commanded. [[H6680]]

###### 20
When Araunah [[H728]] looked out [[H8259]] and saw [[H7200]] the king [[H4428]] and his servants [[H5650]] coming [[H5674]] toward him, [[H5921]] he [[H728]] went out [[H3318]] and bowed [[H7812]] facedown [[H639]] before the king. [[H4428]]

###### 21
“Why [[H4069]] has my lord [[H113]] the king [[H4428]] come [[H935]] to [[H413]] his servant?” [[H5650]] Araunah [[H728]] said. [[H559]] “To buy [[H7069]] your threshing floor,” [[H1637]] David [[H1732]] replied, [[H559]] “that I may build [[H1129]] an altar [[H4196]] to the LORD, [[H3068]] so that the plague [[H4046]] on [[H5921]] the people [[H5971]] may be halted.” [[H6113]]

###### 22
Araunah [[H728]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] David, [[H1732]] “My lord [[H113]] the king [[H4428]] may take [[H3947]] whatever [seems] good [[H2896]] and offer it up. [[H5927]] Here are the oxen [[H1241]] for a burnt offering [[H5930]] and the threshing sledges [[H4173]] and ox [[H1241]] yokes [[H3627]] for the wood. [[H6086]]

###### 23
O king, [[H4428]] Araunah [[H728]] gives [[H5414]] all these [[H3605]] to the king.” [[H4428]] [He] also [[H728]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] the king, [[H4428]] “May the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] accept you.” [[H7521]]

###### 24
“No,” [[H3808]] replied [[H559]] the king, [[H4428]] “I insist on paying [[H7069]] a price, [[H4242]] for I will not [[H3808]] offer [[H5927]] to the LORD [[H3068]] my God [[H430]] burnt offerings [[H5930]] that cost me nothing.” [[H2600]] So David [[H1732]] bought [[H7069]] the threshing floor [[H1637]] and the oxen [[H1241]] for fifty [[H2572]] shekels [[H8255]] of silver. [[H3701]]

###### 25
And [[H1732]] there [[H8033]] he built [[H1129]] an altar [[H4196]] to the LORD [[H3068]] and offered [[H5927]] burnt offerings [[H5930]] and peace offerings. [[H8002]] Then the LORD [[H3068]] answered the prayers [[H6279]] on behalf of the land, [[H776]] and the plague [[H4046]] on [[H5921]] Israel [[H3478]] was halted. [[H6113]]
