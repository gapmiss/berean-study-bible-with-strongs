### 1
These [[H428]] are the last [[H314]] words [[H1697]] of David: [[H1732]] “The oracle [[H5002]] of David [[H1732]] son [[H1121]] of Jesse, [[H3448]] the oracle [[H5002]] of the man [[H1397]] raised [[H6965]] on high, [[H5920]] the one anointed [[H4899]] by the God [[H430]] of Jacob, [[H3290]] and the sweet [[H5273]] psalmist [[H2158]] of Israel: [[H3478]]

### 2
The Spirit [[H7307]] of the LORD [[H3068]] spoke through me; [[H1696]] His word [[H4405]] was on [[H5921]] my tongue. [[H3956]]

### 3
The God [[H430]] of Israel [[H3478]] spoke; [[H559]] the Rock [[H6697]] of Israel [[H3478]] said to me, [[H1696]] ‘He who rules [[H4910]] the people [[H120]] with justice, [[H6662]] who rules [[H4910]] in the fear [[H3374]] of God, [[H430]]

### 4
is like the light [[H216]] of the morning [[H1242]] at sunrise [[H8121]] of a cloudless [[H3808]] dawn, [[H1242]] the glistening [[H5051]] after the rain [[H4306]] on the sprouting grass [[H1877]] of the earth.’ [[H776]]

### 5
Is not [[H3808]] my house [[H1004]] right [[H3651]] with [[H5973]] God? [[H410]] For [[H3588]] He has established [[H7760]] with me  an everlasting [[H5769]] covenant, [[H1285]] ordered [[H6186]] and secured [[H8104]] in every part. [[H3605]] Will He not [[H3808]] bring about [[H6779]] my full [[H3605]] salvation [[H3468]] and my every [[H3605]] desire? [[H2656]]

### 6
But the worthless [[H1100]] are all [[H3605]] like thorns [[H6975]] raked aside, [[H5074]] for [[H3588]] they can never [[H3808]] be gathered [[H3947]] by hand. [[H3027]]

### 7
The man [[H376]] [who] touches [[H5060]] them  must be armed [[H4390]] with iron [[H1270]] or with the shaft [[H6086]] of a spear. [[H2595]] The fire [[H784]] will burn them to ashes [[H8313]] in [the] place [where they lie].” [[H7675]]

### 8
These [[H428]] are the names [[H8034]] of David’s [[H1732]] mighty men: [[H1368]] Josheb-basshebeth [[H3427]] the Tahchemonite [[H8461]] was chief [[H7218]] of the Three. [[H7991]] He [[H1931]] wielded [[H5722]] his spear [[H6112]] against [[H5921]] eight [[H8083]] hundred [men], [[H3967]] whom he killed [[H2491]] at one [[H259]] time. [[H6471]]

### 9
Next in command was [[H310]] Eleazar [[H499]] son [[H1121]] of Dodo [[H1734]] the Ahohite. [[H266]] As one of the three [[H7969]] mighty men, [[H1368]] he [went] with [[H5973]] David [[H1732]] to taunt [[H2778]] the Philistines [[H6430]] who had gathered [[H622]] for battle [[H4421]] [at Pas-dammim]. [[H8033]] The men [[H376]] of Israel [[H3478]] retreated, [[H5927]]

### 10
but Eleazar [[H1931]] stood his ground [[H6965]] and struck [[H5221]] the Philistines [[H6430]] until [[H5704]] his hand [[H3027]] grew weary [[H3021]] and stuck [[H1692]] to [[H413]] his sword. [[H2719]] The LORD [[H3068]] brought about [[H6213]] a great [[H1419]] victory [[H8668]] that [[H1931]] day. [[H3117]] Then the troops [[H5971]] returned [[H7725]] to him, [[H310]] but only [[H389]] to plunder the dead. [[H6584]]

### 11
And after him [[H310]] was Shammah [[H8037]] son [[H1121]] of Agee [[H89]] the Hararite. [[H2043]] When the Philistines [[H6430]] had banded together [[H622]] near [[H2416]] a field [[H2513]] full of [[H4395]] lentils, [[H5742]] [Israel's] troops [[H5971]] fled [[H5127]] from [[H6440]] [them]. [[H6430]]

### 12
But Shammah took his stand [[H3320]] in the middle [[H8432]] of the field, [[H2513]] defended it, [[H5337]] and struck down [[H5221]] the Philistines. [[H6430]] So the LORD [[H3068]] brought about [[H6213]] a great [[H1419]] victory. [[H8668]]

### 13
At [[H413]] harvest time, [[H7105]] three [[H7970]] of the thirty [[H7970]] chief men [[H7218]] went down [[H3381]] to [[H413]] David [[H1732]] at [[H413]] the cave [[H4631]] of Adullam, [[H5725]] while a company [[H2416]] of Philistines [[H6430]] was encamped [[H2583]] in the Valley [[H6010]] of Rephaim. [[H7497]]

### 14
At that time [[H227]] David [[H1732]] was in the stronghold, [[H4686]] and the garrison [[H4673]] of the Philistines [[H6430]] was at Bethlehem. [[H1035]]

### 15
David [[H1732]] longed [for water] [[H183]] and said, [[H559]] “Oh, that someone [[H4310]] would get me a drink [[H8248]] of water [[H4325]] from the well [[H877]] near the gate [[H8179]] of Bethlehem!” [[H1035]]

### 16
So the three [[H7969]] mighty men [[H1368]] broke [[H1234]] through the Philistine [[H6430]] camp, [[H4264]] drew [[H7579]] water [[H4325]] from the well [[H877]] near the gate [[H8179]] of Bethlehem, [[H1035]] and brought [it] [[H935]] back to [[H413]] David. [[H1732]] But he refused [[H3808]] to drink it; [[H8354]] instead, he poured it out [[H5258]] to the LORD, [[H3068]]

### 17
saying, [[H559]] “Far be it [[H2486]] from me,  O LORD, [[H3068]] to do [[H6213]] this! [[H2063]] Is [this not] the blood [[H1818]] of the men [[H582]] who risked their lives?” [[H5315]] So he refused [[H3808]] to drink it. [[H8354]] Such [[H428]] were the exploits [[H6213]] of the three [[H7969]] mighty men. [[H1368]]

### 18
Now Abishai, [[H52]] the brother [[H251]] of Joab [[H3097]] and son [[H1121]] of Zeruiah, [[H6870]] was chief [[H7218]] of the Three, [[H7992]] and he [[H1931]] lifted [[H5782]] his spear [[H2595]] against [[H5921]] three [[H7969]] hundred [men], [[H3967]] killed [them], [[H2491]] and won  a name [[H8034]] along with [the] Three. [[H7969]]

### 19
Was he not [[H3588]] more honored [[H3513]] than [[H4480]] the Three? [[H7969]] And he became [[H1961]] their commander, [[H8269]] even though he was not [[H3808]] included [[H935]] among the Three. [[H7969]]

### 20
And Benaiah [[H1141]] son [[H1121]] of Jehoiada [[H3077]] [was] a valiant [[H2416]] warrior [[H376]] from Kabzeel, [[H6909]] a man of many [[H7227]] exploits. [[H6467]] [He] [[H1931]] struck down [[H5221]] two [[H8147]] champions [[H739]] of Moab, [[H4124]] and on a snowy [[H7950]] day [[H3117]] he [[H1931]] went down [[H3381]] into [[H8432]] a pit [[H953]] and killed [[H5221]] a lion. [[H738]]

### 21
He [[H1931]] also killed [[H5221]] an Egyptian, [[H4713]] a huge [[H4758]] man. [[H376]] Although the Egyptian [[H4713]] had a spear [[H2595]] in his hand, [[H3027]] Benaiah went against [[H3381]] him [[H413]] with a club, [[H7626]] snatched [[H1497]] the spear [[H2595]] from [his] [[H4713]] hand, [[H3027]] and killed [the Egyptian] [[H2026]] with his own spear. [[H2595]]

### 22
These [[H428]] were the exploits [[H6213]] of Benaiah [[H1141]] son [[H1121]] of Jehoiada, [[H3077]] who won  a name [[H8034]] alongside the three [[H7969]] mighty men. [[H1368]]

### 23
He was the most honored [[H3513]] of the Thirty, [[H7970]] but he did not [[H3808]] become [[H935]] one of the Three. [[H7969]] And David [[H1732]] appointed [[H7760]] him over [[H413]] his guard. [[H4928]]

### 24
Now [these were members of] the Thirty: [[H7970]] Asahel [[H6214]] the brother [[H251]] of Joab, [[H3097]] Elhanan [[H445]] son [[H1121]] of Dodo [[H1734]] of Bethlehem, [[H1035]]
