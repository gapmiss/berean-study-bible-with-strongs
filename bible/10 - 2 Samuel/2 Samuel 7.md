# 2 Samuel 7

[[2 Samuel 6|←]] • [[2 Samuel 8|→]]

---

###### 1
After [[H1961]] the king [[H4428]] had settled [[H3427]] into his palace [[H1004]] and the LORD [[H3068]] had given him rest [[H5117]] from all [[H3605]] his enemies [[H341]] around him, [[H5439]]

###### 2
[he] [[H4428]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Nathan [[H5416]] the prophet, [[H5030]] “Here [[H7200]] I am, [[H595]] living [[H3427]] in a house [[H1004]] of cedar, [[H730]] while the ark [[H727]] of God [[H430]] remains [[H3427]] in [[H8432]] a tent.” [[H3407]]

###### 3
So Nathan [[H5416]] told [[H559]] the king, [[H4428]] “Go [[H1980]] and do [[H6213]] all [[H3605]] that [is] [[H834]] in your heart, [[H3824]] for [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] is with you.” [[H5973]]

###### 4
But that [[H1931]] night [[H3915]] the word [[H1697]] of the LORD [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] to [[H413]] Nathan, [[H5416]] saying, [[H559]]

###### 5
“Go [[H1980]] and tell [[H559]] My servant [[H5650]] David [[H1732]] that this is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] says: [[H559]] Are you the one [[H859]] to build [[H1129]] for Me  a house [[H1004]] to dwell in? [[H3427]]

###### 6
For [[H3588]] I have not [[H3808]] dwelt [[H3427]] in a house [[H1004]] from the day [[H3117]] I brought [[H5927]] the Israelites [[H1121]] out of Egypt [[H4714]] until [[H5704]] this [[H2088]] day, [[H3117]] but I have [[H1961]] moved about [[H1980]] with a tent [[H168]] as My dwelling. [[H4908]]

###### 7
In all [[H3605]] My journeys [[H1980]] with all [[H3605]] the Israelites, [[H1121]] have I ever asked [[H1696]] any [[H259]] [of the leaders], [[H7626]] whom [[H834]] I commanded [[H6680]] to shepherd [[H7462]] My people [[H5971]] Israel, [[H3478]] ‘Why [[H4100]] have you not [[H3808]] built [[H1129]] Me  a house [[H1004]] of cedar?’ [[H730]]

###### 8
Now [[H6258]] then, [[H3541]] you are to tell [[H559]] My servant [[H5650]] David [[H1732]] that this is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts [[H6635]] says: [[H559]] I [[H589]] took you [[H3947]] from [[H4480]] the pasture, [[H5116]] from following [[H310]] the flock, [[H6629]] to be [[H1961]] the ruler [[H5057]] over [[H5921]] My people [[H5971]] Israel. [[H3478]]

###### 9
I have been [[H1961]] with you [[H5973]] wherever [[H834]] you have gone, [[H1980]] and I have cut off [[H3772]] all [[H3605]] your enemies [[H341]] from before you. [[H6440]] Now I will make [[H6213]] for you  a name [[H8034]] like [[H8034]] the greatest [[H1419]] in the land. [[H776]]

###### 10
And I will provide [[H7760]] a place [[H4725]] for My people [[H5971]] Israel [[H3478]] and will plant them [[H5193]] so that they may dwell in [[H7931]] a place of their own [[H8478]] and be disturbed [[H7264]] no [[H3808]] more. [[H5750]] No [[H3808]] longer [[H3254]] will the sons [[H1121]] of wickedness [[H5766]] oppress them [[H6031]] as they did [[H834]] at the beginning [[H7223]]

###### 11
and [have done] since [[H4480]] the day [[H3117]] I appointed [[H6680]] judges [[H8199]] over [[H5921]] My people [[H5971]] Israel. [[H3478]] I will give you rest [[H5117]] from all [[H3605]] your enemies. [[H341]] The LORD [[H3068]] declares [[H5046]] to you  that He Himself [[H3068]] will establish [[H6213]] a house [[H1004]] for you. 

###### 12
And when [[H3588]] your days [[H3117]] are fulfilled [[H4390]] and you rest [[H7901]] with [[H854]] your fathers, [[H1]] I will raise up [[H6965]] your offspring [[H2233]] after you, [[H310]] who [[H834]] will come [[H3318]] from your own body, [[H4578]] and I will establish [[H3559]] his kingdom. [[H4467]]

###### 13
He [[H1931]] will build [[H1129]] a house [[H1004]] for My name, [[H8034]] and I will establish [[H3559]] the throne [[H3678]] of his kingdom [[H4467]] forever. [[H5704]]

###### 14
I [[H589]] will be [[H1961]] his  Father, [[H1]] and he [[H1931]] will be [[H1961]] My  son. [[H1121]] When [[H834]] he does wrong, [[H5753]] I will discipline him [[H3198]] with the rod [[H7626]] of men [[H376]] and with the blows [[H5061]] of the sons [[H1121]] of men. [[H120]]

###### 15
But My loving devotion [[H2617]] will never [[H3808]] depart from him [[H5493]] as [[H834]] I removed [[H5493]] it from [[H4480]] Saul, [[H7586]] whom [[H834]] I moved out of [[H5493]] your way. [[H6440]]

###### 16
Your house [[H1004]] and kingdom [[H4467]] will endure [[H539]] forever [[H5769]] before [[H6440]] Me, [[H5704]] and your throne [[H3678]] will be [[H1961]] established [[H3559]] forever.” [[H5704]]

###### 17
According to all [[H3605]] these [[H428]] words [[H1697]] and this [[H2088]] entire [[H3605]] vision, [[H2384]] so [[H3651]] Nathan [[H5416]] spoke [[H1696]] to [[H413]] David. [[H1732]]

###### 18
Then King [[H4428]] David [[H1732]] went in, [[H935]] sat [[H3427]] before [[H6440]] the LORD, [[H3068]] and said, [[H559]] “Who [[H4310]] am I, [[H595]] O Lord [[H136]] GOD, [[H3069]] and what [[H4310]] is my house, [[H1004]] that [[H3588]] You have brought me [[H935]] this far? [[H1988]]

###### 19
And as if [[H5750]] this [[H2063]] was a small thing [[H6994]] in Your eyes, [[H5869]] O Lord [[H136]] GOD, [[H3068]] You have also [[H1571]] spoken [[H1696]] about [[H413]] the future [[H7350]] of the house [[H1004]] of Your servant. [[H5650]] [Is] this [[H2063]] Your custom [[H8452]] with man, [[H120]] O Lord [[H136]] GOD? [[H3068]]

###### 20
What [[H4100]] more [[H3254]] can David [[H1732]] say [[H1696]] to You? [[H413]] For You [[H859]] know [[H3045]] Your servant, [[H5650]] O Lord [[H136]] GOD. [[H3069]]

###### 21
For the sake [[H5668]] of Your word [[H1697]] and according to Your own heart, [[H3820]] You have accomplished [[H6213]] this [[H2063]] great thing [[H1420]] and revealed it [[H3045]] to Your servant. [[H5650]]

###### 22
How [[H5921]] great You are, [[H1431]] O Lord [[H136]] GOD! [[H3069]] For [[H3588]] [there is] none [[H369]] like You, [[H3644]] and there is no [[H369]] God [[H430]] besides You, [[H2108]] according to everything [[H3605]] we have heard [[H8085]] with our own ears. [[H241]]

###### 23
And who [[H4310]] is like Your people [[H5971]] Israel— [[H3478]] the one [[H259]] nation [[H1471]] on earth [[H776]] whom [[H834]] God [[H430]] went out [[H1980]] to redeem [[H6299]] as a people [[H5971]] for Himself,  to make [[H7760]] a name [[H8034]] for Himself,  and to perform [[H6213]] for them  great [[H1420]] and awesome wonders [[H3372]] by driving out nations [[H1471]] and their gods [[H430]] from before [[H6440]] Your people, [[H5971]] whom [[H834]] You redeemed [[H6299]] for Yourself  from Egypt? [[H4714]]

###### 24
For You have established [[H3559]] Your people [[H5971]] Israel [[H3478]] as Your very own  forever, [[H5704]] and You, [[H859]] O LORD, [[H3068]] have become [[H1961]] their God. [[H430]]

###### 25
And now, [[H6258]] O LORD [[H3068]] God, [[H430]] confirm [[H6965]] forever [[H5704]] the word [[H1697]] You have spoken [[H1696]] concerning [[H5921]] Your servant [[H5650]] and his house. [[H1004]] Do [[H6213]] as [[H834]] You have promised, [[H1696]]

###### 26
so that Your name [[H8034]] will be magnified [[H1431]] forever [[H5704]] when it is said, [[H559]] ‘The LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts [[H6635]] is God [[H430]] over [[H5921]] Israel.’ [[H3478]] And the house [[H1004]] of Your servant [[H5650]] David [[H1732]] will be [[H1961]] established [[H3559]] before You. [[H6440]]

###### 27
For [[H3588]] You, [[H859]] O LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts, [[H6635]] the God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] have revealed [this] [[H1540]] to Your servant [[H5650]] when You said, [[H559]] ‘I will build [[H1129]] a house for you.’ [[H1004]] Therefore [[H5921]] Your servant [[H5650]] has found [[H4672]] the courage [[H3820]] to offer [[H6419]] this [[H2063]] prayer [[H8605]] to You. [[H413]]

###### 28
And now, [[H6258]] O Lord [[H136]] GOD, [[H3069]] You [[H859]] are [[H1931]] God! [[H430]] Your words [[H1697]] are [[H1961]] true, [[H571]] and You have promised [[H1696]] this [[H2063]] goodness [[H2896]] to [[H413]] Your servant. [[H5650]]

###### 29
Now therefore, [[H6258]] may it please You [[H2974]] to bless [[H1288]] the house [[H1004]] of Your servant, [[H5650]] that it may continue [[H1961]] forever [[H5769]] before You. [[H6440]] For [[H3588]] You, [[H859]] O Lord [[H136]] GOD, [[H3069]] have spoken, [[H1696]] and with Your blessing [[H1293]] the house [[H1004]] of Your servant [[H5650]] will be blessed forever. [[H1288]]
