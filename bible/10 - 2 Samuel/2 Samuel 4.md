### 1
Now when [Ish-bosheth] son [[H1121]] of Saul [[H7586]] heard [[H8085]] that [[H3588]] Abner [[H74]] had died [[H4191]] in Hebron, [[H2275]] he lost [[H7503]] courage, [[H3027]] and all [[H3605]] Israel [[H3478]] was dismayed. [[H926]]

### 2
Saul’s [[H7586]] son [[H1121]] had two [[H8147]] men [[H376]] who were leaders [[H8269]] of raiding parties: [[H1416]] One [was] [[H259]] named [[H8034]] Baanah [[H1196]] and the other [[H8145]] Rechab; [[H7394]] [they were] the sons [[H1121]] of Rimmon [[H7417]] the Beerothite [[H886]] of the tribe [[H1121]] of Benjamin [[H1144]] ( [[H3588]] Beeroth [[H881]] is also [[H1571]] considered [[H2803]] part of [[H5921]] Benjamin, [[H1144]]

### 3
because the Beerothites [[H886]] fled [[H1272]] to Gittaim [[H1664]] and live [[H1961]] there [[H8033]] as foreigners [[H1481]] to [[H5704]] this very [[H2088]] day). [[H3117]]

### 4
And Jonathan [[H3083]] son [[H1121]] of Saul [[H7586]] had a son [who was] [[H1121]] lame in [[H5223]] [his] feet. [[H7272]] He was [[H1961]] five [[H2568]] years old [[H1121]] when the report [[H8052]] about Saul [[H7586]] and Jonathan [[H3083]] came [[H935]] from Jezreel. [[H3157]] His nurse [[H539]] picked him up [[H5375]] and fled, [[H5127]] but as she was hurrying [[H2648]] to escape, [[H5127]] he fell [[H5307]] and became lame. [[H6452]] His name [[H8034]] was Mephibosheth. [[H4648]]

### 5
Now Rechab [[H7394]] and Baanah, [[H1196]] the sons [[H1121]] of Rimmon [[H7417]] the Beerothite, [[H886]] set out [[H1980]] and arrived [[H935]] at [[H413]] the house [[H1004]] of Ish-bosheth [[H378]] in the heat [[H2527]] of the day, [[H3117]] while the king [[H1931]] was taking his midday [[H6672]] nap. [[H7901]]

### 6
They entered [[H935]] the interior [[H8432]] of the house [[H1004]] as if to get [[H3947]] some wheat, [[H2406]] and they stabbed him [[H5221]] in [[H413]] the stomach. [[H2570]] Then Rechab [[H7394]] and his brother [[H251]] Baanah [[H1196]] slipped away. [[H4422]]

### 7
They had entered [[H935]] the house [[H1004]] while Ish-bosheth [[H1931]] was lying [[H7901]] on [[H5921]] his bed, [[H4296]] and having stabbed [[H5221]] and killed him, [[H4191]] they beheaded [[H5493]] him, [[H7218]] took [[H3947]] his head, [[H7218]] and traveled [[H1980]] all [[H3605]] night [[H3915]] by way [[H1870]] of the Arabah. [[H6160]]

### 8
They brought [[H935]] the head [[H7218]] of  Ish-bosheth [[H378]] to [[H413]] David [[H1732]] at Hebron [[H2275]] and said [[H559]] to [[H413]] the king, [[H4428]] “Here is [[H2009]] the head [[H7218]] of Ish-bosheth [[H378]] son [[H1121]] of Saul, [[H7586]] your enemy [[H341]] who [[H834]] sought [[H1245]] your life. [[H5315]] Today [[H3117]] the LORD [[H3068]] has granted [[H5414]] vengeance [[H5360]] to my lord [[H113]] the king [[H4428]] against Saul [[H7586]] and his offspring. [[H2233]]

### 9
But David [[H1732]] answered [[H6030]] Rechab [[H7394]] and his brother [[H251]] Baanah, [[H1196]] sons [[H1121]] of Rimmon [[H7417]] the Beerothite, [[H886]] “As surely as the LORD [[H3068]] lives, [[H2416]] who [[H834]] has redeemed [[H6299]] my life [[H5315]] from all [[H3605]] distress, [[H6869]]

### 10
when [[H3588]] someone told [[H5046]] me,  ‘Look, [[H2009]] Saul [[H7586]] is dead’ [[H4191]] and thought [[H5869]] he [[H1931]] was [[H1961]] a bearer of good news, [[H1319]] I seized [[H270]] him  and put him to death [[H2026]] at Ziklag. [[H6860]] That [[H834]] was his reward [[H5414]] for [his] news! [[H1309]]

### 11
How much more, [[H637]] when [[H3588]] wicked [[H7563]] men [[H376]] kill [[H2026]] a righteous [[H6662]] man [[H376]] in his own house [[H1004]] [and] on [[H5921]] his own bed, [[H4904]] shall I not now [[H6258]] require [[H1245]] his blood [[H1818]] from [[H4480]] your hands [[H3027]] and wipe you off [[H1197]] the earth!” [[H776]]

### 12
So David [[H1732]] commanded [[H6680]] his young men, [[H5288]] and they killed [Rechab and Baanah]. [[H2026]] They cut off [[H7112]] their hands [[H3027]] and feet [[H7272]] and hung [[H8518]] their bodies by [[H5921]] the pool [[H1295]] in Hebron, [[H2275]] but they took [[H3947]] the head [[H7218]] of Ish-bosheth [[H378]] and buried [[H6912]] it in Abner’s [[H74]] tomb [[H6913]] in Hebron.
