### 1
Furthermore, Ahithophel [[H302]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Absalom, [[H53]] “Let me choose [[H977]] twelve [[H8147]] thousand [[H505]] men [[H376]] and set out [[H6965]] tonight [[H3915]] in pursuit of [[H7291]] David. [[H1732]]

### 2
I will attack [[H935]] him while he [[H1931]] is weak [[H7504]] and weary; [[H3023]] I will throw him into a panic, [[H2729]] and all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] with him [[H854]] will flee; [[H5127]] I will strike down [[H5221]] only [[H905]] the king [[H4428]]

### 3
and bring all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] back [[H7725]] to you. [[H413]] When everyone [[H3605]] returns [[H7725]] except the man [[H376]] you [[H859]] seek, [[H1245]] all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] will be [[H1961]] at peace.” [[H7965]]

### 4
This proposal [[H1697]] seemed [[H5869]] good [[H3474]] to Absalom [[H53]] and all [[H3605]] the elders [[H2205]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

### 5
Then Absalom [[H53]] said, [[H559]] “Summon [[H7121]] Hushai [[H2365]] the Archite [[H757]] as well, [[H1571]] and let us hear [[H8085]] what [[H4100]] he [[H1931]] too [[H1571]] has to say.” [[H6310]]

### 6
So Hushai [[H2365]] came [[H935]] to [[H413]] Absalom, [[H53]] [who] [[H53]] told him, [[H559]] “Ahithophel [[H302]] has spoken [[H1696]] this [[H2088]] proposal. [[H1697]] Should we carry it out? [[H6213]] If [[H518]] not, [[H369]] what do you [[H859]] say?” [[H1696]]

### 7
Hushai [[H2365]] replied, [[H559]] “This [[H2063]] time [[H6471]] the advice [[H6098]] of Ahithophel [[H302]] is not [[H3808]] sound.” [[H2896]]

### 8
[He] [[H2365]] continued, [[H559]] “You [[H859]] know [[H3045]] your father [[H1]] and his men. [[H376]] They [are] [[H1992]] mighty men, [[H1368]] and as fierce [[H4751]] as a wild [[H7704]] bear [[H1677]] robbed of her cubs. [[H7909]] Moreover, your father [is] [[H1]] a man [[H376]] of war [[H4421]] who will not [[H3808]] spend the night [[H3885]] with [[H854]] the troops. [[H5971]]

### 9
Surely [[H2009]] by now [[H6258]] he [[H1931]] is hiding [[H2244]] in a [[H259]] cave [[H6354]] or [[H176]] some other [[H259]] location. [[H4725]] If some of your troops fall [[H5307]] first, [[H8462]] whoever hears [of it] [[H8085]] will say, [[H559]] ‘There [[H1961]] has been [[H1961]] a slaughter [[H4046]] among the troops [[H5971]] who [[H834]] follow [[H310]] Absalom.’ [[H53]]

### 10
Then [[H1931]] even [[H1571]] the most valiant [[H2428]] soldier [[H1121]] with the heart [[H3820]] of a lion [[H738]] will melt with fear, [[H4549]] because [[H3588]] all [[H3605]] Israel [[H3478]] knows [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] your father [[H1]] is a mighty man [[H1368]] who has valiant [[H2428]] men [[H1121]] with him. [[H854]]

### 11
Instead, [[H3588]] I advise [[H3289]] that all [[H3605]] Israel [[H3478]] from Dan [[H1835]] to [[H5704]] Beersheba— [[H884]] a multitude [[H7230]] like the sand [[H2344]] by [[H5921]] the sea— [[H3220]] be gathered [[H622]] to you, [[H5921]] and that you yourself [[H6440]] lead them [[H1980]] into battle. [[H7128]]

### 12
Then we will attack [[H935]] [David] [[H413]] wherever [[H4725]] we find him, [[H4672]] and we [[H5117]] will descend [[H5307]] on [[H5921]] him like [[H834]] dew [[H2919]] on [[H5921]] the ground. [[H127]] And of all [[H3605]] the men [[H582]] with him, [[H854]] not [[H3808]] even [[H1571]] one [[H259]] will remain. [[H3498]]

### 13
If [[H518]] he retreats [[H622]] to [[H413]] a city, [[H5892]] all [[H3605]] Israel [[H3478]] will bring [[H5375]] ropes [[H2256]] to [[H413]] that [[H1931]] city, [[H5892]] and we will drag [[H5498]] it [[H853]] down to [[H5704]] the valley [[H5158]] until [[H5704]] not [[H3808]] even [[H1571]] a pebble [[H6872]] can be found.” [[H4672]]

### 14
Then Absalom [[H53]] and all [[H3605]] the men [[H376]] of Israel [[H3478]] said, [[H559]] “The advice [[H6098]] of Hushai [[H2365]] the Archite [[H757]] [is] better [[H2896]] than [that] [[H6098]] of Ahithophel.” [[H302]] For the LORD [[H3068]] had purposed [[H6680]] to thwart [[H6565]] the good [[H2896]] counsel [[H6098]] of Ahithophel, [[H302]] in order to [[H5668]] bring [[H935]] disaster [[H7451]] on [[H413]] Absalom. [[H53]]

### 15
So Hushai [[H2365]] told [[H559]] Zadok [[H6659]] and Abiathar, [[H54]] the priests, [[H3548]] “This is what [[H2063]] Ahithophel [[H302]] has advised [[H3289]] Absalom [[H53]] and the elders [[H2205]] of Israel, [[H3478]] and this is what [[H2063]] I [[H589]] have advised. [[H3289]]

### 16
Now [[H6258]] send [[H7971]] quickly [[H4120]] and tell [[H5046]] David, [[H1732]] ‘Do not [[H408]] spend [[H3885]] the night [[H3915]] at the fords [[H6160]] of the wilderness, [[H4057]] but [[H1571]] be sure to cross over. [[H5674]] Otherwise [[H6435]] the king [[H4428]] and all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] with him [[H854]] will be swallowed up.’” [[H1104]]

### 17
Now Jonathan [[H3083]] and Ahimaaz [[H290]] were staying [[H5975]] at  En-rogel, [[H5883]] where a servant girl [[H8198]] would come [[H1980]] and pass along information to them. [[H5046]] They [[H1992]] in turn would go [[H1980]] and inform [[H5046]] King [[H4428]] David, [[H1732]] for [[H3588]] they dared [[H3201]] not [[H3808]] be seen [[H7200]] entering [[H935]] the city. [[H5892]]

### 18
But a young man [[H5288]] did see [[H7200]] them [[H853]] and told [[H5046]] Absalom. [[H53]] So the two [[H8147]] left [[H1980]] quickly [[H4120]] and came [[H935]] to [[H413]] the house [[H1004]] of a man [[H376]] in Bahurim. [[H980]] He had  a well [[H875]] in his courtyard, [[H2691]] and they climbed down [[H3381]] into it. [[H8033]]

### 19
Then [the man's] wife [[H802]] took [[H3947]] a covering [[H4539]] and spread [[H6566]] it over [[H5921]] the mouth [[H6440]] of the well [[H875]] and scattered [[H7849]] grain [[H7383]] over it, [[H5921]] so nobody [[H3808]] would know [[H3045]] a thing. [[H1697]]

### 20
When Absalom’s [[H53]] servants [[H5650]] came [[H935]] to [[H413]] the woman [[H802]] at the house, [[H1004]] they asked, [[H559]] “Where [[H346]] are Ahimaaz [[H290]] and Jonathan?” [[H3083]] “They have crossed over [[H5674]] the brook,” [[H4323]] she [[H802]] replied. [[H559]] The men searched [[H1245]] but did not [[H3808]] find [them], [[H4672]] so they returned [[H7725]] to Jerusalem. [[H3389]]

### 21
After [[H310]] [the men] had gone, [[H1980]] Ahimaaz and Jonathan climbed up [[H5927]] out of the well [[H875]] and went [[H1980]] to inform [[H5046]] King [[H4428]] David, [[H1732]] saying, [[H559]] “Get up [[H6965]] and cross over [[H5674]] the river [[H4325]] at once, [[H4120]] for [[H3588]] Ahithophel [[H302]] has given this [[H3602]] advice [[H3289]] against you.” [[H5921]]

### 22
So David [[H1732]] and all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] with him [[H854]] got up [[H6965]] and crossed [[H5674]] the Jordan. [[H3383]] By [[H5704]] daybreak, [[H216]] there was no [[H3808]] one [[H259]] left [[H5737]] who [[H834]] had not [[H3808]] crossed [[H5674]] the Jordan. [[H3383]]

### 23
When Ahithophel [[H302]] saw [[H7200]] that [[H3588]] his advice [[H6098]] had not [[H3808]] been followed, [[H6213]] he saddled [[H2280]] his donkey [[H2543]] and set out [[H6965]] for [[H413]] his house [[H1004]] in [[H413]] his hometown. [[H5892]] He put his affairs [[H413]] in order [[H6680]] and hanged himself. [[H2614]] So he died [[H4191]] and was buried [[H6912]] in his father’s [[H1]] tomb. [[H6913]]

### 24
Then David [[H1732]] went [[H935]] to Mahanaim, [[H4266]] and Absalom [[H53]] crossed over [[H5674]] the Jordan [[H3383]] with [[H5973]] all [[H3605]] the men [[H376]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

### 25
Absalom [[H53]] had appointed [[H7760]] Amasa [[H6021]] over [[H5921]] the army [[H6635]] in place [[H8478]] of Joab. [[H3097]] Amasa [[H6021]] was the son [[H1121]] of a man [[H376]] named [[H8034]] Ithra, [[H3501]] the Ishmaelite [[H3481]] who [[H834]] had married [[H935]] Abigail [[H26]] daughter [[H1323]] of Nahash [[H5176]] and sister [[H269]] of Zeruiah [[H6870]] the mother [[H517]] of Joab. [[H3097]]

### 26
So the Israelites [[H3478]] and Absalom [[H53]] camped [[H2583]] in the land [[H776]] of Gilead. [[H1568]]

### 27
When David [[H1732]] came [[H935]] to Mahanaim, [[H4266]] [he was met by] Shobi [[H7629]] son [[H1121]] of Nahash [[H5176]] from Rabbah [[H7237]] of the Ammonites, [[H1121]] Machir [[H4353]] son [[H1121]] of Ammiel [[H5988]] from Lo-debar, [[H3810]] and Barzillai [[H1271]] the Gileadite [[H1569]] from Rogelim. [[H7274]]

### 28
[They brought] beds, [[H4904]] basins, [[H5592]] and earthen [[H3335]] vessels, [[H3627]] as well as wheat, [[H2406]] barley, [[H8184]] flour, [[H7058]] roasted grain, [[H7039]] beans, [[H6321]] lentils, [[H5742]]

### 29
honey, [[H1706]] curds, [[H2529]] sheep, [[H6629]] and cheese [[H8194]] from the herd [[H1241]] for David [[H1732]] and his people [[H5971]] to eat. [[H398]] For [[H3588]] they said, [[H559]] “The people [[H5971]] have become hungry, [[H7457]] exhausted, [[H5889]] and thirsty [[H6771]] in the wilderness.” [[H4057]]
