###### 1
Then [[G2532]] I looked [[G3708]] and [[G2532]] saw [[G2400]] the [[G3588]] Lamb [[G721]] standing [[G2476]] on [[G1909]] Mount [[G3735]] Zion, [[G4622]] and [[G2532]] with [[G3326]] Him [[G846]] 144,000 {} [[G1540]] who had [[G2192]] His [[G846]] name [[G3686]] and [[G2532]] His [[G846]] Father’s [[G3962]] name [[G3686]] written [[G1125]] on [[G1909]] their [[G846]] foreheads. [[G3359]]

###### 2
And [[G2532]] I heard [[G191]] a sound [[G5456]] from [[G1537]] heaven [[G3772]] like [[G5613]] [the] roar [[G5456]] of rushing [[G4183]] waters [[G5204]] and [[G2532]] [the] loud [[G3173]] rumbling [[G5456]] of thunder. [[G1027]] And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] sound [[G5456]] I heard [[G191]] [was] like [[G5613]] harpists [[G2790]] strumming [[G2789]] their [[G846]] harps. [[G2788]]

###### 3
And [[G2532]] they sang [[G103]] a new [[G2537]] song [[G5603]] before [[G1799]] the [[G3588]] throne [[G2362]] and [[G2532]] before [[G1799]] the [[G3588]] four [[G5064]] living creatures [[G2226]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] elders. [[G4245]] And [[G2532]] no one [[G3762]] could [[G1410]] learn [[G3129]] the [[G3588]] song [[G5603]] except [[G1487]] the [[G3588]] 144,000 {} [[G1540]] who [[G3588]] had been redeemed [[G59]] from [[G575]] the [[G3588]] earth. [[G1093]]

###### 4
These [[G3778]] are [[G1510]] the ones who [[G3739]] have not been defiled [[G3435]] with [[G3326]] women, [[G1135]] for [[G1063]] they are [[G1510]] virgins. [[G3933]] They [[G3778]] follow [[G190]] the [[G3588]] Lamb [[G721]] wherever [[G3699]] He goes. [[G5217]] They [[G3778]] have been redeemed [[G59]] from among [[G575]] men [[G444]] [as] firstfruits [[G536]] to God [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] to the [[G3588]] Lamb. [[G721]]

###### 5
And [[G2532]] no [[G3756]] lie [[G5579]] was found [[G2147]] in [[G1722]] their [[G846]] mouths; [[G4750]] they are [[G1510]] blameless. [[G299]]

###### 6
Then [[G2532]] I saw [[G3708]] another [[G243]] angel [[G32]] flying [[G4072]] overhead, [[G3321]] with [[G2192]] [the] eternal [[G166]] gospel [[G2098]] to proclaim [[G2097]] to [[G1909]] those who [[G3588]] dwell [[G2521]] on [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] earth— [[G1093]] to [[G1909]] every [[G3956]] nation [[G1484]] and [[G2532]] tribe [[G5443]] and [[G2532]] tongue [[G1100]] and [[G2532]] people. [[G2992]]

###### 7
He said [[G3004]] in [[G1722]] a loud [[G3173]] voice, [[G5456]] “Fear [[G5399]] God [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] give [[G1325]] Him [[G846]] glory, [[G1391]] because [[G3754]] the [[G3588]] hour [[G5610]] of [[G3588]] His [[G846]] judgment [[G2920]] has come. [[G2064]] Worship [[G4352]] the [One who] [[G3588]] made [[G4160]] the [[G3588]] heavens [[G3772]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] earth [[G1093]] and [[G2532]] [the] sea [[G2281]] and [[G2532]] [the] springs [[G4077]] of waters. [[G5204]]

###### 8
Then [[G2532]] a [[G243]] second [[G1208]] angel [[G32]] followed, [[G190]] saying, [[G3004]] “Fallen, [[G4098]] fallen is [[G4098]] Babylon [[G897]] the [[G3588]] great, [[G3173]] who {has made} [[G3739]] all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] nations [[G1484]] drink [[G4222]] the [[G3588]] wine [[G3631]] of the [[G3588]] passion [[G2372]] of [[G3588]] her [[G846]] immorality. [[G4202]]

###### 9
And [[G2532]] a third [[G5154]] angel [[G32]] followed [[G190]] them, [[G846]] calling out [[G3004]] in [[G1722]] loud [[G3173]] a voice, [[G5456]] “If [[G1487]] anyone [[G5100]] worships [[G4352]] the [[G3588]] beast [[G2342]] and [[G2532]] its [[G846]] image, [[G1504]] and [[G2532]] receives [[G2983]] [its] mark [[G5480]] on [[G1909]] his [[G846]] forehead [[G3359]] or [[G2228]] on [[G1909]] his [[G3588]] hand, [[G5495]]

###### 10
he [[G846]] too [[G2532]] will drink [[G4095]] the [[G3588]] wine [[G3631]] of God’s [[G2316]] anger, [[G2372]] poured [[G2767]] undiluted [[G194]] into [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] cup [[G4221]] of [[G3588]] His [[G846]] wrath. [[G3709]] And [[G2532]] he will be tormented [[G928]] in [[G1722]] fire [[G4442]] and [[G2532]] brimstone [[G2303]] in the presence of [[G1799]] [the] holy [[G40]] angels [[G32]] and [[G2532]] of the [[G3588]] Lamb. [[G721]]

###### 11
And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] smoke [[G2586]] of [[G3588]] their [[G846]] torment [[G929]] will rise [[G305]] forever [[G165]] [and] ever. [[G165]] Day [[G2250]] and [[G2532]] night [[G3571]] [there will be] [[G2192]] no [[G3756]] rest [[G372]] for those who [[G3588]] worship [[G4352]] the [[G3588]] beast [[G2342]] and [[G2532]] its [[G846]] image, [[G1504]] [or] [[G2532]] [for] [[G1487]] anyone who [[G5100]] receives [[G2983]] the [[G3588]] mark [[G5480]] of its [[G846]] name. [[G3686]]

###### 12
Here [[G5602]] is [a call for] [[G1510]] the [[G3588]] endurance [[G5281]] of the [[G3588]] saints [[G40]] who [[G3588]] keep [[G5083]] the [[G3588]] commandments [[G1785]] of God [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] faith [[G4102]] of Jesus. [[G2424]]

###### 13
And [[G2532]] I heard [[G191]] a voice [[G5456]] from [[G1537]] heaven [[G3772]] telling [me] [[G3004]] to write, [[G1125]] “Blessed [are] [[G3107]] the [[G3588]] dead— [[G3498]] those who [[G3588]] die [[G599]] in [[G1722]] [the] Lord [[G2962]] from [[G575]] this moment on.” [[G737]] “Yes,” [[G3483]] says [[G3004]] the [[G3588]] Spirit, [[G4151]] “they will rest [[G373]] from [[G1537]] their [[G846]] labors, [[G2873]] for [[G1063]] their [[G846]] deeds [[G2041]] will follow [[G190]] them.” [[G846]]

###### 14
And [[G2532]] I looked [[G3708]] and [[G2532]] saw [[G2400]] a white [[G3022]] cloud, [[G3507]] and [[G2532]] seated [[G2521]] on [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] cloud [[G3507]] [was One] like [[G3664]] [the] Son [[G5207]] of Man, [[G444]] with [[G2192]] a golden [[G5552]] crown [[G4735]] on [[G1909]] His [[G846]] head [[G2776]] and [[G2532]] a sharp [[G3691]] sickle [[G1407]] in [[G1722]] His [[G846]] hand. [[G5495]]

###### 15
Then [[G2532]] another [[G243]] angel [[G32]] came out [[G1831]] of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] temple, [[G3485]] crying out [[G2896]] in [[G1722]] a loud [[G3173]] voice [[G5456]] to the [One] [[G3588]] seated [[G2521]] on [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] cloud, [[G3507]] “Swing [[G3992]] Your [[G4771]] sickle [[G1407]] and [[G2532]] reap, [[G2325]] because [[G3754]] the [[G3588]] time [[G5610]] has come [[G2064]] to harvest; [[G2325]] for [[G3754]] the [[G3588]] crop [[G2326]] of the [[G3588]] earth [[G1093]] is ripe. [[G3583]]

###### 16
[So] [[G2532]] the [One] [[G3588]] seated [[G2521]] on [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] cloud [[G3507]] swung [[G906]] His [[G846]] sickle [[G1407]] over [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] earth, [[G1093]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] earth [[G1093]] was harvested. [[G2325]]

###### 17
Then [[G2532]] another [[G243]] angel [[G32]] came [[G1831]] out of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] temple [[G3485]] in [[G1722]] heaven, [[G3772]] and [[G2532]] he [too] [[G846]] had [[G2192]] a sharp [[G3691]] sickle. [[G1407]]

###### 18
[Still] [[G2532]] another [[G243]] angel, [[G32]] with [[G2192]] authority [[G1849]] over [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] fire, [[G4442]] came [[G1831]] from [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] altar [[G2379]] and [[G2532]] called out [[G5455]] in a loud [[G3173]] voice [[G5456]] to the [angel] [[G3588]] with [[G2192]] the [[G3588]] sharp [[G3691]] sickle, [[G1407]] Swing [[G3992]] your [[G4771]] sharp [[G3691]] sickle [[G1407]] and [[G2532]] gather [[G5166]] the [[G3588]] clusters [of grapes] [[G1009]] from the [[G3588]] vine [[G288]] of the [[G3588]] earth, [[G1093]] because [[G3754]] its [[G846]] grapes [[G4718]] are ripe. [[G187]]

###### 19
[So] [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] angel [[G32]] swung [[G906]] his [[G846]] sickle [[G1407]] over [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] earth [[G1093]] and [[G2532]] gathered [[G5166]] the [[G3588]] [grapes] [[G288]] of the [[G3588]] earth, [[G1093]] and [[G2532]] he threw [them] [[G906]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] great [[G3173]] winepress [[G3025]] of Gods [[G2316]] wrath. [[G2372]]

###### 20
And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] winepress [[G3025]] was trodden [[G3961]] outside [[G1855]] the [[G3588]] city, [[G4172]] and [[G2532]] [the] blood [[G129]] [that] flowed [[G1831]] from [[G1537]] [it] [[G3025]] [rose] as high as [[G891]] the [[G3588]] bridles [[G5469]] of the [[G3588]] horses, [[G2462]] for a distance of [[G575]] 1,600 {} [[G5507]] stadia. [[G4712]]
