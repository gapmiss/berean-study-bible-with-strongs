### 1
After [[G3326]] this [[G3778]] I saw [[G3708]] four [[G5064]] angels [[G32]] standing [[G2476]] at [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] four [[G5064]] corners [[G1137]] of the [[G3588]] earth, [[G1093]] holding back [[G2902]] [its] [[G1093]] four [[G5064]] winds [[G417]] so that [[G2443]] no [[G3361]] wind [[G417]] would blow [[G4154]] on [[G1909]] land [[G1093]] [or] [[G3383]] sea [[G2281]] [or] [[G3383]] on [[G1909]] any [[G3956]] tree. [[G1186]]

### 2
And [[G2532]] I saw [[G3708]] another [[G243]] angel [[G32]] ascending [[G305]] from [[G575]] [the] east, [[G395]] with [[G2192]] [the] seal [[G4973]] of [the] living [[G2198]] God. [[G2316]] And [[G2532]] he called out [[G2896]] in a loud [[G3173]] voice [[G5456]] to the [[G3588]] four [[G5064]] angels [[G32]] who [[G3739]] had been given [power] [[G1325]] to harm [[G91]] the [[G3588]] land [[G1093]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] sea: [[G2281]]

### 3
“[Do] not [[G3361]] harm [[G91]] the [[G3588]] land [[G1093]] [or] [[G3383]] sea [[G2281]] [or] [[G3383]] trees [[G1186]] until [[G891]] we have sealed [[G4972]] the [[G3588]] foreheads [[G3359]] of the [[G3588]] servants [[G1401]] of our [[G1473]] God.” [[G2316]]

### 4
And [[G2532]] I heard [[G191]] the [[G3588]] number [[G706]] of those who [[G3588]] were sealed, [[G4972]] 144,000 {} [[G1540]] from [[G1537]] all the [[G3956]] tribes [[G5443]] of Israel: [[G2474]]

### 5
From [[G1537]] [the] tribe [[G5443]] of Judah [[G2448]] 12,000 {} [[G1427]] were sealed, [[G4972]] from [[G1537]] [the] tribe [[G5443]] of Reuben [[G4502]] 12,000 {}, [[G1427]] from [[G1537]] [the] tribe [[G5443]] of Gad [[G1045]] 12,000 {}, [[G1427]]

### 6
from [[G1537]] [the] tribe [[G5443]] of Asher [[G768]] 12,000 {}, [[G1427]] from [[G1537]] [the] tribe [[G5443]] of Naphtali [[G3508]] 12,000 {}, [[G1427]] from [[G1537]] [the] tribe [[G5443]] of Manasseh [[G3128]] 12,000 {}, [[G1427]]

### 7
from [[G1537]] [the] tribe [[G5443]] of Simeon [[G4826]] 12,000 {}, [[G1427]] from [[G1537]] [the] tribe [[G5443]] of Levi [[G3017]] 12,000 {}, [[G1427]] from [[G1537]] [the] tribe [[G5443]] of Isaachar [[G2466]] 12,000 {}, [[G1427]]

### 8
from [[G1537]] [the] tribe [[G5443]] of Zebulun [[G2194]] 12,000 {}, [[G1427]] from [[G1537]] [the] tribe [[G5443]] of Joseph [[G2501]] 12,000 {}, [[G1427]] [and] from [[G1537]] [the] tribe [[G5443]] of Benjamin [[G958]] 12,000 {}. [[G1427]]

### 9
After [[G3326]] this [[G3778]] I looked [[G3708]] and [[G2532]] saw [[G2400]] a multitude [[G3793]] too large [[G4183]] to count, [[G705]] from [[G1537]] every [[G3956]] nation [[G1484]] and [[G2532]] tribe [[G5443]] and [[G2532]] people [[G2992]] and [[G2532]] tongue, [[G1100]] standing [[G2476]] before [[G1799]] the [[G3588]] throne [[G2362]] and [[G2532]] before [[G1799]] the [[G3588]] Lamb. [[G721]] [They were] wearing [[G4016]] white [[G3022]] robes [[G4749]] and [were holding] [[G2532]] palm branches [[G5404]] in [[G1722]] their [[G846]] hands. [[G5495]]

### 10
And [[G2532]] they cried out [[G2896]] in a loud voice: [[G5456]] “Salvation [[G4991]] to [[G3588]] our [[G1473]] God, [[G2316]] who [[G3588]] sits [[G2521]] on [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] throne, [[G2362]] and [[G2532]] to the [[G3588]] Lamb!” [[G721]]

### 11
And [[G2532]] all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] angels [[G32]] stood [[G2476]] around [[G2945]] the [[G3588]] throne [[G2362]] and [around] [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] elders [[G4245]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] four [[G5064]] living creatures. [[G2226]] And [[G2532]] they fell facedown [[G4098]] before [[G1799]] the [[G3588]] throne [[G2362]] and [[G2532]] worshiped [[G4352]] God, [[G2316]]

### 12
saying, [[G3004]] “Amen! [[G281]] Blessing [[G2129]] and [[G2532]] glory [[G1391]] and [[G2532]] wisdom [[G4678]] and [[G2532]] thanks [[G2169]] and [[G2532]] honor [[G5092]] and [[G2532]] power [[G1411]] and [[G2532]] strength [[G2479]] to [[G3588]] our [[G1473]] God [[G2316]] forever [[G165]] [and] [[G3588]] ever! [[G165]] Amen. [[G281]]

### 13
Then [[G2532]] one [[G1520]] of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] elders [[G4245]] addressed [[G611]] me: [[G1473]] “These [[G3778]] in [[G4016]] white [[G3022]] robes,” [[G4749]] he asked, [[G3004]] “who [[G5101]] are they, [[G1510]] and [[G2532]] where [[G4159]] have they come {from}?” [[G2064]]

### 14
“Sir,” [[G1473]] I answered, [[G2046]] “you [[G4771]] know.” [[G1492]] [So] [[G2532]] he replied, [[G2036]] “These [[G3778]] are [[G1510]] the ones [[G3588]] who have come [[G2064]] out of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] great [[G3173]] tribulation; [[G2347]] they have washed [[G4150]] their [[G846]] robes [[G4749]] and [[G2532]] made them white [[G3021]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] blood [[G129]] of the [[G3588]] Lamb. [[G721]]

### 15
For this reason, [[G1223]] ‘They are [[G1510]] before [[G1799]] the [[G3588]] throne [[G2362]] of God [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] serve [[G3000]] Him [[G846]] day [[G2250]] and [[G2532]] night [[G3571]] in [[G1722]] His [[G846]] temple; [[G3485]] and [[G2532]] the [One] [[G3588]] seated [[G2521]] on [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] throne [[G2362]] will spread His tabernacle [[G4637]] over [[G1909]] them. [[G846]]

### 16
Never [[G3756]] again [[G2089]] will they hunger, [[G3983]] [and never] [[G3761]] will they thirst; [[G1372]] nor [[G3761]] {will} the [[G3588]] sun [[G2246]] beat down [[G4098]] upon [[G1909]] them, [[G846]] nor [[G3761]] any [[G3956]] scorching heat. [[G2738]]

### 17
For [[G3754]] the [[G3588]] Lamb [[G721]] in [[G303]] [the] center [[G3319]] of the [[G3588]] throne [[G2362]] will be their shepherd. [[G4165]] He will lead [[G3594]] them [[G846]] to [[G1909]] springs [[G4077]] of living [[G2222]] water, [[G5204]] and [[G2532]] God [[G2316]] will wipe away [[G1813]] every [[G3956]] tear [[G1144]] from [[G1537]] their [[G846]] eyes. [[G3788]]
