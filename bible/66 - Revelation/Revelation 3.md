###### 1
To the [[G3588]] angel [[G32]] of the [[G3588]] church [[G1577]] in [[G1722]] Sardis [[G4554]] write: [[G1125]] These [are] [[G3592]] the words [[G3004]] of the [One who] [[G3588]] holds [[G2192]] the [[G3588]] sevenfold [[G2033]] Spirit [[G4151]] of God [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] seven [[G2033]] stars. [[G792]] I know [[G1492]] your [[G4771]] deeds; [[G2041]] you have [[G2192]] [a] reputation [[G3686]] for [[G3754]] being alive, [[G2198]] yet [[G2532]] you are [[G1510]] dead. [[G3498]]

###### 2
Wake up [[G1127]] and [[G2532]] strengthen [[G4741]] what [[G3588]] remains, [[G3062]] which [[G3739]] was about [[G3195]] to die; [[G599]] for [[G1063]] I have found [[G2147]] your [[G4771]] deeds [[G2041]] incomplete [[G4137]] in the sight of [[G1799]] My [[G1473]] God. [[G2316]]

###### 3
Remember, [[G3421]] then, [[G3767]] what [[G4459]] you have received [[G2983]] and [[G2532]] heard. [[G191]] Keep [it] [[G5083]] and [[G2532]] repent. [[G3340]] If [[G1437]] you do not wake up, [[G1127]] I will come [[G2240]] like [[G5613]] a thief, [[G2812]] and [[G2532]] you will not know [[G1097]] the hour [[G5610]] when [[G4169]] I will come [[G2240]] upon [[G1909]] you. [[G4771]]

###### 4
But [[G235]] you do have [[G2192]] a few [[G3641]] people [[G3686]] in [[G1722]] Sardis [[G4554]] who [[G3739]] have not soiled [[G3435]] their [[G846]] garments, [[G2440]] and [[G2532]] because [[G3754]] they are [[G1510]] worthy, [[G514]] they will walk [[G4043]] with [[G3326]] Me [[G1473]] in [[G1722]] white. [[G3022]]

###### 5
Like [them], [[G3779]] the [one who] [[G3588]] is victorious [[G3528]] will be dressed [[G4016]] in [[G1722]] white. [[G3022]] And [[G2532]] I will never blot out [[G1813]] his [[G846]] name [[G3686]] from [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] book [[G976]] of life, [[G2222]] [but] [[G2532]] I will confess [[G3670]] his [[G846]] name [[G3686]] before [[G1799]] My [[G1473]] Father [[G3962]] and [[G2532]] His [[G846]] angels. [[G32]]

###### 6
He who [[G3588]] has [[G2192]] an ear, [[G3775]] let him hear [[G191]] what [[G5101]] the [[G3588]] Spirit [[G4151]] says [[G3004]] to the [[G3588]] churches. [[G1577]]

###### 7
To [[G3588]] [the] angel [[G32]] of the [[G3588]] church [[G1577]] in [[G1722]] Philadelphia [[G5359]] write: [[G1125]] These [are] [[G3592]] the words [[G3004]] of the [One who is] [[G3588]] holy [[G40]] [and] [[G3588]] true, [[G228]] who [[G3588]] holds [[G2192]] the [[G3588]] key [[G2807]] of David. [[G1138]] What [[G3588]] He opens, [[G455]] no one [[G3762]] will shut; [[G2808]] and [[G2532]] what He shuts, [[G2808]] no one [[G3762]] will open. [[G455]]

###### 8
I know [[G1492]] your [[G4771]] deeds. [[G2041]] See, [[G2400]] I have placed [[G1325]] before [[G1799]] you [[G4771]] an open [[G455]] door, [[G2374]] which [[G3739]] no one [[G3762]] can [[G1410]] shut. [[G2808]] For [[G3754]] you have [[G2192]] only a little [[G3398]] strength, [[G1411]] yet [[G2532]] you have kept [[G5083]] My [[G1473]] word [[G3056]] and [[G2532]] have not denied [[G720]] My [[G1473]] name. [[G3686]]

###### 9
Look at [[G2400]] [those who belong] to [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] synagogue [[G4864]] of Satan, [[G4567]] who [[G3588]] claim [[G3004]] to be [[G1510]] Jews [[G2453]] [but] [[G2532]] are [[G1510]] liars [[G5574]] instead. [[G235]] I will make [[G4160]] them [[G846]] come [[G2240]] and [[G2532]] bow down [[G4352]] at [[G1799]] your [[G4771]] feet, [[G4228]] and [[G2532]] they will know [[G1097]] that [[G3754]] I [[G1473]] love [[G25]] you. [[G4771]]

###### 10
Because [[G3754]] you have kept [[G5083]] My [[G1473]] command [[G3056]] to endure with patience, [[G5281]] I will also keep [[G5083]] you [[G4771]] from [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] hour [[G5610]] of [[G3588]] testing [[G3986]] that [[G3588]] is about [[G3195]] to come [[G2064]] upon [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] whole [[G3650]] world, [[G3625]] to test [[G3985]] those who [[G3588]] dwell [[G2730]] on [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] earth. [[G1093]]

###### 11
I am coming [[G2064]] soon. [[G5035]] Hold fast [[G2902]] to what [[G3739]] you have, [[G2192]] so that [[G2443]] no one [[G3367]] will take [[G2983]] your [[G4771]] crown. [[G4735]]

###### 12
The [one who] [[G3588]] is victorious [[G3528]] I will make [[G4160]] a pillar [[G4769]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] temple [[G3485]] of [[G3588]] My [[G1473]] God, [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] he will never again leave [it]. [[G1831]] Upon [[G1909]] him [[G846]] I will write [[G1125]] the [[G3588]] name [[G3686]] of [[G3588]] My [[G1473]] God, [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] name [[G3686]] of the [[G3588]] city [[G4172]] of [[G3588]] My [[G1473]] God [[G2316]] (the [[G3588]] new [[G2537]] Jerusalem [[G2419]] that [[G3588]] comes down [[G2597]] out of [[G1537]] heaven [[G3772]] from [[G575]] My [[G1473]] God), [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] My [[G1473]] new [[G2537]] name. [[G3686]]

###### 13
He who [[G3588]] has [[G2192]] an ear, [[G3775]] let him hear [[G191]] what [[G5101]] the [[G3588]] Spirit [[G4151]] says [[G3004]] to the [[G3588]] churches. [[G1577]]

###### 14
To the [[G3588]] angel [[G32]] of the [[G3588]] church [[G1577]] in [[G1722]] Laodicea [[G2993]] write: [[G1125]] These [are] [[G3592]] the words [[G3004]] of the [[G3588]] Amen, [[G281]] the [[G3588]] faithful [[G4103]] and [[G2532]] TRUE [[G228]] Witness, [[G3144]] the [[G3588]] Originator [[G746]] of God’s [[G2316]] creation. [[G2937]]

###### 15
I know [[G1492]] your [[G4771]] deeds; [[G2041]] you are [[G1510]] neither [[G3777]] cold [[G5593]] nor [[G3777]] hot. [[G2200]] [How] I wish [[G3785]] you were [[G1510]] [one] [[G5593]] or [[G2228]] [the other]! [[G2200]]

###### 16
So [[G3779]] because [[G3754]] you are [[G1510]] lukewarm— [[G5513]] neither [[G3777]] hot [[G2200]] nor [[G3777]] cold— [[G5593]] I am about [[G3195]] to vomit [[G1692]] you [[G4771]] out of [[G1537]] My [[G1473]] mouth! [[G4750]]

###### 17
You say, [[G3004]] ‘I am [[G1510]] rich; [[G4145]] I have grown wealthy [[G4147]] and [[G2532]] need [[G5532]] nothing.’ [[G3762]] [But] [[G2532]] you do not realize [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] you [[G4771]] are [[G1510]] wretched, [[G5005]] pitiful, [[G1652]] poor, [[G4434]] blind, [[G5185]] and [[G2532]] naked. [[G1131]]

###### 18
I counsel [[G4823]] you [[G4771]] to buy [[G59]] from [[G3844]] Me [[G1473]] gold [[G5553]] refined [[G4448]] by [[G1537]] fire [[G4442]] so that [[G2443]] you may become rich, [[G4147]] white [[G3022]] garments [[G2440]] so that [[G2443]] you may be clothed [[G4016]] and [[G2532]] your [[G4771]] shameful [[G152]] nakedness [[G1132]] not exposed, [[G5319]] and [[G2532]] salve [[G2854]] to anoint [[G1472]] your [[G4771]] eyes [[G3788]] so that [[G2443]] you may see. [[G991]]

###### 19
Those [[G3745]] I [[G1473]] love, [[G5368]] I rebuke [[G1651]] and [[G2532]] discipline. [[G3811]] Therefore [[G3767]] be earnest [[G2206]] and [[G2532]] repent. [[G3340]]

###### 20
Behold, [[G2400]] I stand [[G2476]] at [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] door [[G2374]] and [[G2532]] knock. [[G2925]] If [[G1437]] anyone [[G5100]] hears [[G191]] My [[G1473]] voice [[G5456]] and [[G2532]] opens [[G455]] the [[G3588]] door, [[G2374]] I will come in [[G1525]] and [[G2532]] dine [[G1172]] with [[G3326]] him, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] he [[G846]] with [[G3326]] Me. [[G1473]]

###### 21
To [the one] [[G846]] who [[G3588]] is victorious, [[G3528]] I will grant [the right] [[G1325]] to sit [[G2523]] with [[G3326]] Me [[G1473]] on [[G1722]] My [[G1473]] throne, [[G2362]] just as [[G5613]] I [[G2504]] overcame [[G3528]] and [[G2532]] sat down [[G2523]] with [[G3326]] My [[G1473]] Father [[G3962]] on [[G1722]] His [[G846]] throne. [[G2362]]

###### 22
He who [[G3588]] has [[G2192]] an ear, [[G3775]] let him hear [[G191]] what [[G5101]] the [[G3588]] Spirit [[G4151]] says [[G3004]] to the [[G3588]] churches.” [[G1577]]
