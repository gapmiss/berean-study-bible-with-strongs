### 1
Then [[G2532]] I saw [[G3708]] an angel [[G32]] coming down [[G2597]] from [[G1537]] heaven [[G3772]] with the [[G3588]] key [[G2807]] to the [[G3588]] Abyss, [[G12]] holding [[G2192]] in [[G1909]] his [[G846]] hand [[G5495]] a great [[G3173]] chain. [[G254]]

### 2
He seized [[G2902]] the [[G3588]] dragon, [[G1404]] the [[G3588]] ancient [[G744]] serpent [[G3789]] who [[G3739]] is [[G1510]] [the] devil [[G1228]] and [[G2532]] Satan, [[G4567]] and [[G2532]] bound [[G1210]] him [[G846]] for a thousand [[G5507]] years. [[G2094]]

### 3
And [[G2532]] he threw [[G906]] him [[G846]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] Abyss, [[G12]] shut [it], [[G2808]] and [[G2532]] sealed [it] [[G4972]] over [[G1883]] him, [[G846]] so that [[G2443]] he could not deceive [[G4105]] the [[G3588]] nations [[G1484]] until [[G891]] the [[G3588]] thousand [[G5507]] years [[G2094]] were complete. [[G5055]] After that, [[G3326]] he [[G846]] must [[G1163]] be released [[G3089]] for a brief [[G3398]] period of time. [[G5550]]

### 4
Then [[G2532]] I saw [[G3708]] [the] thrones, [[G2362]] and [[G2532]] those seated [[G2523]] on [[G1909]] them [[G846]] had been given [[G1325]] authority to judge. [[G2917]] And [I saw] [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] souls [[G5590]] of those who [[G3588]] had been beheaded [[G3990]] for [[G1223]] [their] [[G3588]] testimony [[G3141]] of Jesus [[G2424]] and [[G2532]] for [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] word [[G3056]] of God, [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] those who [[G3748]] had not worshiped [[G4352]] the [[G3588]] beast [[G2342]] [or] [[G3761]] its [[G846]] image, [[G1504]] and [[G2532]] had not received [[G2983]] [its] [[G3588]] mark [[G5480]] on [[G1909]] [their] [[G3588]] foreheads [[G3359]] [or] [[G2532]] hands. [[G5495]] And [[G2532]] they came to life [[G2198]] and [[G2532]] reigned [[G936]] with [[G3326]] Christ [[G5547]] for a thousand [[G5507]] years. [[G2094]]

### 5
The [[G3588]] rest [[G3062]] of the [[G3588]] dead [[G3498]] {did} not [[G3756]] come back to life [[G2198]] until [[G891]] the [[G3588]] thousand [[G5507]] years [[G2094]] were complete. [[G5055]] This [is] [[G3778]] the [[G3588]] first [[G4413]] resurrection. [[G386]]

### 6
Blessed [[G3107]] and [[G2532]] holy [are] [[G40]] those who [[G3588]] share [[G2192]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] first [[G4413]] resurrection! [[G386]] [The] second [[G1208]] death [[G2288]] has [[G2192]] no [[G3756]] power [[G1849]] over [[G1909]] them, [[G3778]] but [[G235]] they will be [[G1510]] priests [[G2409]] of God [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] of Christ, [[G5547]] and [[G2532]] will reign [[G936]] with [[G3326]] Him [[G846]] for a [[G3588]] thousand [[G5507]] years. [[G2094]]

### 7
When [[G3752]] the [[G3588]] thousand [[G5507]] years [[G2094]] are complete, [[G5055]] Satan [[G4567]] will be released [[G3089]] from [[G1537]] his [[G846]] prison, [[G5438]]

### 8
and [[G2532]] will go out [[G1831]] to deceive [[G4105]] the [[G3588]] nations [[G1484]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] four [[G5064]] corners [[G1137]] of the [[G3588]] earth, [[G1093]] Gog [[G1136]] and [[G2532]] Magog, [[G3098]] to assemble them [[G4863]] for [[G1519]] battle. [[G4171]] [Their] [[G3739]] number [[G706]] [is] like [[G5613]] the [[G3588]] sand [[G285]] of the [[G3588]] seashore. [[G2281]]

### 9
And [[G2532]] they marched across [[G305]] the [[G3588]] broad expanse [[G4114]] of the [[G3588]] earth [[G1093]] and [[G2532]] surrounded [[G2944]] the [[G3588]] camp [[G3925]] of the [[G3588]] saints [[G40]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] beloved [[G25]] city. [[G4172]] But [[G2532]] fire [[G4442]] came down [[G2597]] from [[G1537]] heaven [[G3772]] and [[G2532]] consumed [[G2719]] them. [[G846]]

### 10
And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] devil [[G1228]] who [[G3588]] had deceived [[G4105]] them [[G846]] was thrown [[G906]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] lake [[G3041]] of fire [[G4442]] and [[G2532]] sulfur, [[G2303]] into which [[G3699]] the [[G3588]] beast [[G2342]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] false prophet [[G5578]] [had already been thrown]. [[G2532]] [There] [[G2532]] they will be tormented [[G928]] day [[G2250]] and [[G2532]] night [[G3571]] forever [[G1519]] [and] [[G3588]] ever. [[G165]]

### 11
Then [[G2532]] I saw [[G3708]] a great [[G3173]] white [[G3022]] throne [[G2362]] and [[G2532]] the [One] [[G3588]] seated [[G2521]] on [[G1909]] it. [[G846]] The [[G3588]] earth [[G1093]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] heavens [[G3772]] fled [[G5343]] from [[G575]] [His] [[G3739]] presence, [[G4383]] and [[G2532]] no [[G3756]] place [[G5117]] was found [[G2147]] for them. [[G846]]

### 12
And [[G2532]] I saw [[G3708]] the [[G3588]] dead, [[G3498]] great [[G3173]] and [[G2532]] small, [[G3398]] standing [[G2476]] before [[G1799]] the [[G3588]] throne. [[G2362]] And [[G2532]] there were open [[G455]] books, [[G975]] [and] [[G2532]] one of [[G243]] [them] [[G975]] [was] [[G455]] the [book] [[G3588]] of life. [[G2222]] And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] dead [[G3498]] were judged [[G2919]] according to [[G2596]] their [[G846]] deeds, [[G2041]] as [[G1537]] recorded [[G1125]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] books. [[G975]]

### 13
The [[G3588]] sea [[G2281]] gave up [[G1325]] its [[G846]] dead, [[G3498]] and [[G2532]] Death [[G2288]] and [[G2532]] Hades [[G86]] gave up [[G1325]] [their] [[G3588]] dead, [[G3498]] and [[G2532]] each [one] [[G1538]] was judged [[G2919]] according to [[G2596]] his [[G846]] deeds. [[G2041]]

### 14
Then [[G2532]] Death [[G2288]] and [[G2532]] Hades [[G86]] were thrown [[G906]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] lake [[G3041]] of fire. [[G4442]] This [[G3778]] is [[G1510]] the [[G3588]] second [[G1208]] death— [[G2288]] the [[G3588]] lake [[G3041]] of [[G3588]] fire. [[G4442]]

### 15
And [[G2532]] if [[G1487]] anyone [[G5100]] was found [[G2147]] [whose name] was not written [[G1125]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] book [[G976]] of life, [[G2222]] he was thrown [[G906]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] lake [[G3041]] of fire. [[G4442]]
