[ This is the ] revelation [[G602]] of Jesus [[G2424]] Christ, [[G5547]] which [[G3739]] God [[G2316]] gave [[G1325]] Him [[G846]] to show [[G1166]] His [[G846]] servants [[G1401]] what [[G3739]] must [[G1163]] soon [[G5034]] come to pass. [[G1096]] He made it known [[G4591]] by [[G1223]] sending [[G649]] His [[G846]] angel [[G32]] to [[G3588]] His [[G846]] servant [[G1401]] John, [[G2491]]

###### 2
who [[G3739]] testifies to [[G3140]] everything [[G3745]] he saw. [[G3708]] [This is] the [[G3588]] word [[G3056]] of God [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] testimony [[G3141]] of Jesus [[G2424]] Christ. [[G5547]]

###### 3
Blessed [is] [[G3107]] the [one who] [[G3588]] reads aloud [[G314]] the [[G3588]] words [[G3056]] of [this] [[G3588]] prophecy, [[G4394]] and [ blessed are ] [[G2532]] those who [[G3588]] hear [[G191]] and [[G2532]] obey [[G5083]] what [[G3588]] is written [[G1125]] in [[G1722]] it, [[G846]] because [[G1063]] the [[G3588]] time [is] [[G2540]] near. [[G1451]]

###### 4
John, [[G2491]] To the [[G3588]] seven [[G2033]] churches [[G1577]] in [[G1722]] [the province of] Asia: [[G773]] Grace [[G5485]] and [[G2532]] peace [[G1515]] to you [[G4771]] from [[G575]] Him who [[G3588]] is [[G1510]] and [[G2532]] was [[G1510]] and [[G2532]] is to come, [[G2064]] and [[G2532]] from [[G575]] the [[G3588]] sevenfold [[G2033]] Spirit [[G4151]] before [[G1799]] His [[G846]] throne, [[G2362]]

###### 5
and [[G2532]] from [[G575]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ, [[G5547]] the [[G3588]] faithful [[G4103]] witness, [[G3144]] the [[G3588]] firstborn [[G4416]] from the [[G3588]] dead, [[G3498]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] ruler [[G758]] of the [[G3588]] kings [[G935]] of the [[G3588]] earth. [[G1093]] To Him who [[G3588]] loves [[G25]] us [[G1473]] and [[G2532]] has released [[G3089]] us [[G1473]] from [[G1537]] our [[G1473]] sins [[G266]] by [[G1722]] His [[G846]] blood, [[G129]]

###### 6
[who] [[G2532]] has made [[G4160]] us {to be} [[G1473]] a kingdom, [[G932]] priests [[G2409]] to [[G3588]] His [[G846]] God [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] Father— [[G3962]] to Him [be] [[G846]] the [[G3588]] glory [[G1391]] and [[G2532]] power [[G2904]] forever [[G165]] [and] [[G3588]] ever! [[G165]] Amen. [[G281]]

###### 7
Behold, [[G2400]] He is coming [[G2064]] with [[G3326]] the [[G3588]] clouds, [[G3507]] and [[G2532]] every [[G3956]] eye [[G3788]] will see [[G3708]] Him— [[G846]] even [[G2532]] those who [[G3748]] pierced [[G1574]] Him. [[G846]] And [[G2532]] all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] tribes [[G5443]] of the [[G3588]] earth [[G1093]] will mourn [[G2875]] because of [[G1909]] Him. [[G846]] So shall it be! [[G3483]] Amen. [[G281]]

###### 8
“I [[G1473]] am [[G1510]] the [[G3588]] Alpha [[G1]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] Omega,” [[G5598]] says [[G3004]] [the] Lord [[G2962]] God, [[G2316]] who [[G3588]] is [[G1510]] and [[G2532]] was [[G1510]] and [[G2532]] is to come— [[G2064]] the [[G3588]] Almighty. [[G3841]]

###### 9
I, [[G1473]] John, [[G2491]] your [[G4771]] brother [[G80]] and [[G2532]] partner [[G4791]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] tribulation [[G2347]] and [[G2532]] kingdom [[G932]] and [[G2532]] perseverance [[G5281]] [that are] in [[G1722]] Jesus, [[G2424]] was [[G1096]] on [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] island [[G3520]] of [[G2564]] Patmos [[G3963]] because of [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] word [[G3056]] of God [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] [my] [[G3588]] testimony [[G3141]] about Jesus. [[G2424]]

###### 10
On [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] Lord’s [[G2960]] day [[G2250]] I was [[G1096]] in [[G1722]] [the] Spirit, [[G4151]] and [[G2532]] I heard [[G191]] behind [[G3694]] me [[G1473]] a loud [[G3173]] voice [[G5456]] like [[G5613]] a trumpet, [[G4536]]

###### 11
saying, [[G3004]] “Write [[G1125]] in [[G1519]] a scroll [[G975]] what [[G3739]] you see [[G991]] and [[G2532]] send [it] [[G3992]] to the [[G3588]] seven [[G2033]] churches: [[G1577]] to [[G1519]] Ephesus, [[G2181]] Smyrna, [[G4667]] Pergamum, [[G4010]] Thyatira, [[G2363]] Sardis, [[G4554]] Philadelphia, [[G5359]] and [[G2532]] Laodicea.” [[G2993]]

###### 12
Then [[G2532]] I turned [[G1994]] to see [[G991]] the [[G3588]] voice [[G5456]] that [[G3748]] was speaking [[G2980]] with [[G3326]] me. [[G1473]] And [[G2532]] having turned, [[G1994]] I saw [[G3708]] seven [[G2033]] golden [[G5552]] lampstands, [[G3087]]

###### 13
and [[G2532]] among [[G3319]] the [[G3588]] lampstands [[G3087]] [was One] like [[G3664]] [the] Son [[G5207]] of Man, [[G444]] dressed in a long robe, [[G1746]] with a golden [[G5552]] sash [[G2223]] around [[G4024]] [His] [[G3588]] chest. [[G3149]]

###### 14
The [[G3588]] hair [[G2359]] of His [[G846]] head [[G2776]] [was] white [[G3022]] like [[G5613]] wool, [[G2053]] as white [[G3022]] as [[G5613]] snow, [[G5510]] and [[G2532]] His [[G846]] eyes [[G3788]] [were] like [[G5613]] a blazing [[G5395]] fire. [[G4442]]

###### 15
His [[G846]] feet [[G4228]] [were] like [[G3664]] polished bronze [[G5474]] refined [[G4448]] in [[G1722]] a furnace, [[G2575]] and [[G2532]] His [[G846]] voice [[G5456]] [was] like [[G5613]] [the] roar [[G5456]] of many [[G4183]] waters. [[G5204]]

###### 16
He held [[G2192]] in [[G1722]] His [[G846]] right [[G1188]] hand [[G5495]] seven [[G2033]] stars, [[G792]] and [[G2532]] a sharp [[G3691]] double-edged [[G1366]] sword [[G4501]] came [[G1607]] from [[G1537]] His [[G846]] mouth. [[G4750]] His [[G846]] face [[G3799]] [was] like [[G5613]] the [[G3588]] sun [[G2246]] shining [[G5316]] at [[G1722]] its [[G846]] brightest. [[G1411]]

###### 17
When [[G3753]] I saw [[G3708]] Him, [[G846]] I fell [[G4098]] at [[G4314]] His [[G846]] feet [[G4228]] like [[G5613]] a dead [man]. [[G3498]] [But] [[G2532]] He placed [[G5087]] His [[G846]] right hand [[G1188]] on [[G1909]] me [[G1473]] [and] said, [[G3004]] “{Do} not [[G3361]] be afraid. [[G5399]] I [[G1473]] am [[G1510]] the [[G3588]] First [[G4413]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] Last, [[G2078]]

###### 18
the [[G3588]] Living [One]. [[G2198]] I was [[G1096]] dead, [[G3498]] and [[G2532]] behold, [[G2400]] [now] I am [[G1510]] alive [[G2198]] forever [[G165]] [and] [[G3588]] ever! [[G165]] And [[G2532]] I hold [[G2192]] the [[G3588]] keys [[G2807]] of [[G3588]] Death [[G2288]] and [[G2532]] of [[G3588]] Hades. [[G86]]

###### 19
Therefore [[G3767]] write down [[G1125]] the things [[G3739]] you have seen, [[G3708]] and [[G2532]] the things that [[G3739]] are, [[G1510]] and [[G2532]] the things that [[G3739]] will [[G3195]] happen [[G1096]] after [[G3326]] this. [[G3778]]

###### 20
[This is] the [[G3588]] mystery [[G3466]] of the [[G3588]] seven [[G2033]] stars [[G792]] you saw [[G3708]] in [[G1909]] My [[G1473]] right hand [[G1188]] and [[G2532]] of the [[G3588]] seven [[G2033]] golden [[G5552]] lampstands: [[G3087]] The [[G3588]] seven [[G2033]] stars [[G792]] are [[G1510]] [the] angels [[G32]] of the [[G3588]] seven [[G2033]] churches, [[G1577]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] seven [[G2033]] lampstands [[G3087]] are [[G1510]] [the] seven [[G2033]] churches.
