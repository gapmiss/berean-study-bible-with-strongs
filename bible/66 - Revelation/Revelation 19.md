###### 1
After [[G3326]] this [[G3778]] I heard [[G191]] [a sound] like [[G5613]] [the] roar [[G3173]] of a great [[G4183]] multitude [[G3793]] in [[G1722]] heaven, [[G3772]] shouting: [[G3004]] “Hallelujah! [[G239]] Salvation [[G4991]] and [[G2532]] glory [[G1391]] and [[G2532]] power [[G1411]] belong to [[G3588]] our [[G1473]] God! [[G2316]]

###### 2
For [[G3754]] His [[G846]] judgments [[G2920]] [are] true [[G228]] and [[G2532]] righteous; [[G1342]] He has judged [[G2919]] the [[G3588]] great [[G3173]] prostitute [[G4204]] who [[G3748]] corrupted [[G5351]] the [[G3588]] earth [[G1093]] with [[G1722]] her [[G846]] immorality, [[G4202]] He has avenged [[G1556]] the [[G3588]] blood [[G129]] of His [[G846]] servants [[G1401]] [ that was poured ] out [[G1537]] by her [[G846]] hand. [[G5495]]

###### 3
And [[G2532]] a second time [[G1208]] they called out: [[G2046]] “Hallelujah! [[G239]] Her [[G846]] smoke [[G2586]] ascends [[G305]] forever [[G165]] [and] [[G3588]] ever.” [[G165]]

###### 4
And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] twenty-four [[G1501]] elders [[G4245]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] four [[G5064]] living creatures [[G2226]] fell down [[G4098]] and [[G2532]] worshiped [[G4352]] God [[G2316]] who [[G3588]] sits [[G2521]] on [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] throne, [[G2362]] saying: [[G3004]] “Amen, [[G281]] Hallelujah!” [[G239]]

###### 5
Then [[G2532]] a voice [[G5456]] came [[G1831]] from [[G575]] the [[G3588]] throne, [[G2362]] saying: [[G3004]] “Praise [[G134]] our [[G1473]] God, [[G2316]] all [you] [[G3956]] who serve [[G1401]] Him, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] those who [[G3588]] fear [[G5399]] Him, [[G846]] small [[G3398]] and [[G2532]] great [alike]!” [[G3173]]

###### 6
And [[G2532]] I heard [[G191]] [a sound] like [[G5613]] [the] roar [[G5456]] of a great [[G4183]] multitude, [[G3793]] like [[G5613]] [the] rushing [[G5456]] of many [[G4183]] waters, [[G5204]] and [[G2532]] like [[G5613]] a mighty [[G2478]] rumbling [[G5456]] of thunder, [[G1027]] crying out: [[G3004]] “Hallelujah! [[G239]] For [[G3754]] our [[G1473]] Lord [[G2962]] God, [[G2316]] the [[G3588]] Almighty, [[G3841]] reigns. [[G936]]

###### 7
Let us rejoice [[G5463]] and [[G2532]] celebrate [[G21]] and [[G2532]] give [[G1325]] Him [[G846]] the [[G3588]] glory. [[G1391]] For [[G3754]] the [[G3588]] marriage [[G1062]] of the [[G3588]] Lamb [[G721]] has come, [[G2064]] and [[G2532]] His [[G846]] bride [[G1135]] has made herself ready. [[G2090]]

###### 8
She [[G846]] was given [[G1325]] clothing of [[G4016]] fine linen, [[G1039]] bright [[G2986]] [and] pure.” [[G2513]] For [[G1063]] the [[G3588]] fine linen [ she wears ] [[G1039]] is [[G1510]] the [[G3588]] righteous acts [[G1345]] of the [[G3588]] saints. [[G40]]

###### 9
Then [[G2532]] [the angel] told [[G3004]] me [[G1473]] to write, [[G1125]] “Blessed [are] [[G3107]] those who [[G3588]] are invited [[G2564]] to [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] marriage [[G1062]] supper [[G1173]] of the [[G3588]] Lamb.” [[G721]] And [[G2532]] he said [[G3004]] to me, [[G1473]] “These [[G3778]] are [[G1510]] the [[G3588]] TRUE [[G228]] words [[G3056]] of God.” [[G2316]]

###### 10
[So] [[G2532]] I fell [[G4098]] at [[G1715]] his [[G846]] feet [[G4228]] to worship [[G4352]] him. [[G846]] [But] [[G2532]] he told [[G3004]] me, [[G1473]] “Do not do that! [[G3708]] I am [[G1510]] a fellow servant [[G4889]] with you [[G4771]] and [[G2532]] your [[G4771]] brothers [[G80]] who [[G3588]] rely on [[G2192]] the [[G3588]] testimony [[G3141]] of Jesus. [[G2424]] Worship [[G4352]] God! [[G2316]] For [[G1063]] the [[G3588]] testimony [[G3141]] of Jesus [[G2424]] is [[G1510]] the [[G3588]] spirit [[G4151]] of prophecy. [[G4394]]

###### 11
Then [[G2532]] I saw [[G3708]] heaven [[G3772]] standing open, [[G455]] and [[G2532]] there before me was [[G2400]] a white [[G3022]] horse. [[G2462]] And [[G2532]] its rider [[G3588]] is called [[G2564]] Faithful [[G4103]] and [[G2532]] True. [[G228]] With [[G1722]] righteousness [[G1343]] He judges [[G2919]] and [[G2532]] wages war. [[G4170]]

###### 12
He [has] [[G846]] eyes [[G3788]] like [[G5613]] blazing [[G5395]] fire, [[G4442]] and [[G2532]] many [[G4183]] royal crowns [[G1238]] on [[G1909]] His [[G846]] head. [[G2776]] He has [[G2192]] a name [[G3686]] written [on Him] [[G1125]] that [[G3739]] only [[G3762]] He Himself [[G846]] knows. [[G1492]]

###### 13
He is dressed in [[G4016]] a robe [[G2440]] dipped [[G911]] in blood, [[G129]] and [[G2532]] His [[G846]] name is [[G3686]] The [[G3588]] Word [[G3056]] of God. [[G2316]]

###### 14
The [[G3588]] armies [[G4753]] of [[G3588]] heaven, [[G3772]] dressed in [[G1746]] fine linen, [[G1039]] white [[G3022]] [and] pure, [[G2513]] follow [[G190]] Him [[G846]] on [[G1909]] white [[G3022]] horses. [[G2462]]

###### 15
And [[G2532]] from [[G1537]] His [[G846]] mouth [[G4750]] proceeds [[G1607]] a sharp [[G3691]] sword [[G4501]] with [[G1722]] [which] [[G846]] to strike down [[G3960]] the [[G3588]] nations, [[G1484]] and [[G2532]] He [[G846]] will rule [[G4165]] them [[G846]] with [[G1722]] an iron [[G4603]] scepter. [[G4464]] He [[G846]] treads [[G3961]] the [[G3588]] winepress [[G3025]] of the [[G3588]] fury [[G2372]] of the [[G3588]] wrath [[G3709]] of God, [[G2316]] the [[G3588]] Almighty. [[G3841]]

###### 16
And [[G2532]] He has [[G2192]] a name [[G3686]] written [[G1125]] on [[G1909]] [His] [[G3588]] robe [[G2440]] and [[G2532]] on [[G1909]] His [[G846]] thigh: [[G3382]] King [[G935]] of kings [[G935]] and [[G2532]] Lord [[G2962]] of lords. [[G2962]]

###### 17
Then [[G2532]] I saw [[G3708]] an [[G1520]] angel [[G32]] standing [[G2476]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] sun, [[G2246]] and [[G2532]] he cried out [[G2896]] in [[G1722]] a loud [[G3173]] voice [[G5456]] to all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] birds [[G3732]] flying [[G4072]] overhead, [[G3321]] “Come, [[G1205]] gather together [[G4863]] for [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] great [[G3173]] supper [[G1173]] of God, [[G2316]]

###### 18
so that [[G2443]] you may eat [[G5315]] [the] flesh [[G4561]] of kings [[G935]] and [[G2532]] commanders [[G5506]] and [[G2532]] mighty [men], [[G2478]] of horses [[G2462]] and [[G2532]] riders, [[G3588]] of all [men] [[G3956]] slave [[G1401]] and [[G2532]] free, [[G1658]] small [[G3398]] and [[G2532]] great.” [[G3173]]

###### 19
Then [[G2532]] I saw [[G3708]] the [[G3588]] beast [[G2342]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] kings [[G935]] of the [[G3588]] earth [[G1093]] [with] [[G2532]] their [[G846]] armies [[G4753]] assembled [[G4863]] to wage [[G4160]] war [[G4171]] against [[G3326]] the [One] [[G3588]] seated [[G2521]] on [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] horse, [[G2462]] and [[G2532]] against [[G3326]] His [[G846]] army. [[G4753]]

###### 20
[But] [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] beast [[G2342]] was captured, [[G4084]] and [[G2532]] with [[G3326]] him [[G846]] the [[G3588]] false prophet [[G5578]] who [[G3588]] had performed [[G4160]] signs [[G4592]] on his behalf, [[G1799]] by [[G1722]] which [[G3739]] he deceived [[G4105]] those [[G3588]] who had [[G2983]] the [[G3588]] mark [[G5480]] of the [[G3588]] beast [[G2342]] and [[G2532]] worshiped [[G4352]] its [[G846]] image. [[G1504]] Both [of them] [[G1417]] were thrown [[G906]] alive [[G2198]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] fiery [[G4442]] lake [[G3041]] of burning [[G2545]] sulfur. [[G2303]]

###### 21
And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] rest [[G3062]] were killed [[G615]] with [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] sword [[G4501]] that [[G3588]] proceeded [[G1831]] from [[G1537]] [the] [[G846]] mouth [[G4750]] of the [One] [[G3588]] seated [[G2521]] on [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] horse. [[G2462]] And [[G2532]] all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] birds [[G3732]] gorged themselves [[G5526]] on [[G1537]] their [[G846]] flesh. [[G4561]]
