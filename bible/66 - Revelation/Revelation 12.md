###### 1
And [[G2532]] a great [[G3173]] sign [[G4592]] appeared [[G3708]] in [[G1722]] heaven: [[G3772]] a woman [[G1135]] clothed in [[G4016]] the [[G3588]] sun, [[G2246]] with [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] moon [[G4582]] under [[G5270]] her [[G846]] feet [[G4228]] and [[G2532]] a crown [[G4735]] of twelve [[G1427]] stars [[G792]] on [[G1909]] her [[G846]] head. [[G2776]]

###### 2
She was pregnant [[G2192]] and [[G2532]] crying out [[G2896]] in the pain [[G5605]] and [[G2532]] agony [[G928]] of giving birth. [[G5088]]

###### 3
Then [[G2532]] another [[G243]] sign [[G4592]] appeared [[G3708]] in [[G1722]] heaven: [[G3772]] a huge [[G3173]] red [[G4450]] dragon [[G1404]] [with] [[G2192]] seven [[G2033]] heads, [[G2776]] ten [[G1176]] horns, [[G2768]] and [[G2532]] seven [[G2033]] royal crowns [[G1238]] on [[G1909]] his [[G846]] heads. [[G2776]]

###### 4
His [[G846]] tail [[G3769]] swept [[G4951]] a [[G3588]] third [[G5154]] of the [[G3588]] stars [[G792]] from [[G3588]] [the] sky, [[G3772]] tossing [[G906]] them [[G846]] to [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] earth. [[G1093]] And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] dragon [[G1404]] stood [[G2476]] before [[G1799]] the [[G3588]] woman [[G1135]] as she was about [[G3195]] to give birth, [[G5088]] ready to [[G2443]] devour [[G2719]] her [[G846]] child [[G5043]] as soon as [[G3752]] He was born. [[G5088]]

###### 5
And [[G2532]] she gave birth [[G5088]] to a son, [[G5207]] a male child, [[G730]] who [[G3739]] will [[G3195]] rule [[G4165]] all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] nations [[G1484]] with [[G1722]] an iron [[G4603]] scepter; [[G4464]] and [[G2532]] her [[G846]] child [[G5043]] was caught up [[G726]] to [[G4314]] God [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] to [[G4314]] His [[G846]] throne. [[G2362]]

###### 6
The [[G3588]] woman [[G1135]] fled [[G5343]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] wilderness, [[G2048]] where [[G3699]] God [[G2316]] had prepared [[G2090]] a place [[G5117]] for [[G2443]] her [[G846]] to be nourished [[G5142]] for 1,260 [[G5507]] days. [[G2250]]

###### 7
Then [[G2532]] a war [[G4171]] broke out [[G1096]] in [[G1722]] heaven: [[G3772]] Michael [[G3413]] and [[G2532]] his [[G846]] angels [[G32]] fought [[G4170]] against [[G3326]] the [[G3588]] dragon, [[G1404]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] dragon [[G1404]] and [[G2532]] his [[G846]] angels [[G32]] fought [back]. [[G4170]]

###### 8
[But] [[G2532]] [the dragon] was not strong enough, [[G2480]] [and] no longer [[G3761]] [was] any place [[G5117]] found [[G2147]] in [[G1722]] heaven [[G3772]] for [him and his angels]. [[G846]]

###### 9
And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] great [[G3173]] dragon [[G1404]] was hurled down— [[G906]] the [[G3588]] ancient [[G744]] serpent [[G3789]] called [[G2564]] [the] devil [[G1228]] and [[G2532]] Satan, [[G4567]] the [[G3588]] deceiver [[G4105]] of the [[G3588]] whole [[G3650]] [world]. [[G3625]] He was hurled [[G906]] to [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] earth, [[G1093]] and [[G2532]] his [[G846]] angels [[G32]] with [[G3326]] him. [[G846]]

###### 10
And [[G2532]] I heard [[G191]] a loud [[G3173]] voice [[G5456]] in [[G1722]] heaven, [[G3772]] saying: [[G3004]] “Now [[G737]] have come [[G1096]] the [[G3588]] salvation [[G4991]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] power [[G1411]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] of our [[G1473]] God, [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] authority [[G1849]] of His [[G846]] Christ. [[G5547]] For [[G3754]] the [[G3588]] accuser [[G2725]] of our [[G1473]] brothers [[G80]] has been thrown down, [[G906]] he who [[G3588]] accuses [[G2723]] them [[G846]] day [[G2250]] and [[G2532]] night [[G3571]] before [[G1799]] our [[G1473]] God. [[G2316]]

###### 11
They [[G846]] have conquered [[G3528]] him [[G846]] by [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] blood [[G129]] of the [[G3588]] Lamb [[G721]] and [[G2532]] by [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] word [[G3056]] of [[G3588]] their [[G846]] testimony; [[G3141]] and [[G2532]] they did not love [[G25]] their [[G846]] lives [[G5590]] so as to shy away from [[G891]] death. [[G2288]]

###### 12
Therefore [[G1223]] rejoice, [[G2165]] O [[G3588]] heavens, [[G3772]] and [[G2532]] [you who] [[G3588]] dwell [[G4637]] in [[G1722]] them! [[G846]] [But] woe to [[G3759]] the [[G3588]] earth [[G1093]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] sea; [[G2281]] with [[G2192]] great [[G3173]] fury [[G2372]] the [[G3588]] devil [[G1228]] has come down [[G2597]] to [[G4314]] you, [[G4771]] knowing [[G1492]] he has [[G2192]] only a short [[G3641]] time. [[G2540]]

###### 13
And [[G2532]] when [[G3753]] the [[G3588]] dragon [[G1404]] saw [[G3708]] that [[G3754]] he had been thrown [[G906]] to [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] earth, [[G1093]] he pursued [[G1377]] the [[G3588]] woman [[G1135]] who [[G3748]] had given birth [[G5088]] to the [[G3588]] male [child]. [[G730]]

###### 14
[But] [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] woman [[G1135]] was given [[G1325]] two [[G1417]] wings [[G4420]] of a [[G3588]] great [[G3173]] eagle [[G105]] to [[G2443]] fly [[G4072]] from [[G575]] [the] presence [[G4383]] of the [[G3588]] serpent [[G3789]] to [[G1519]] her [[G846]] place [[G5117]] in [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] wilderness, [[G2048]] where [[G3699]] she was nourished [[G5142]] for a time, [[G2540]] and [[G2532]] times, [[G2540]] and [[G2532]] half [[G2255]] a time. [[G2540]]

###### 15
Then [[G2532]] from [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] mouth [[G4750]] of the [[G3588]] serpent [[G3789]] spewed [[G906]] water [[G5204]] like [[G5613]] a river [[G4215]] to overtake [[G3694]] the [[G3588]] woman [[G1135]] [and] [[G2443]] sweep [[G4160]] her [[G846]] away in the torrent. [[G4216]]

###### 16
[But] [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] earth [[G1093]] helped [[G997]] the [[G3588]] woman [[G1135]] and [[G2532]] opened [[G455]] its [[G846]] mouth [[G4750]] to swallow up [[G2666]] the [[G3588]] river [[G4215]] that [[G3739]] had poured [[G906]] from [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] dragon’s [[G1404]] mouth. [[G4750]]

###### 17
And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] dragon [[G1404]] was enraged [[G3710]] at [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] woman, [[G1135]] and [[G2532]] went [[G565]] to make [[G4160]] war [[G4171]] with [[G3326]] the [[G3588]] rest [[G3062]] of [[G3588]] her [[G846]] children, [[G4690]] who [[G3588]] keep [[G5083]] the [[G3588]] commandments [[G1785]] of God [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] hold to [[G2192]] the [[G3588]] testimony [[G3141]] of Jesus. [[G2424]] And [[G2532]] [the dragon] stood [[G2476]] on [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] sand [[G285]] of the [[G3588]] seashore. [[G2281]]
