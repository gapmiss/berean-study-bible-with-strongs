### 1
Then [[G2532]] I watched [[G3708]] as [[G3753]] the [[G3588]] Lamb [[G721]] opened [[G455]] one [[G1520]] of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] seven [[G2033]] seals, [[G4973]] and [[G2532]] I heard [[G191]] one [[G1520]] of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] four [[G5064]] living creatures [[G2226]] say [[G3004]] in [[G5613]] a thunderous [[G1027]] voice, [[G5456]] Come! [[G2064]]

### 2
[So] [[G2532]] I looked [[G3708]] and [[G2532]] saw [[G2400]] a white [[G3022]] horse, [[G2462]] and [[G2532]] its rider [[G3588]] had [[G2192]] a bow. [[G5115]] And [[G2532]] he [[G846]] was given [[G1325]] a crown, [[G4735]] and [[G2532]] he rode out [[G1831]] to overcome [[G3528]] and [[G2532]] conquer. [[G3528]]

### 3
And [[G2532]] when [[G3753]] [the Lamb] opened [[G455]] the [[G3588]] second [[G1208]] seal, [[G4973]] I heard [[G191]] the [[G3588]] second [[G1208]] living creature [[G2226]] say, [[G3004]] “Come!” [[G2064]]

### 4
Then [[G2532]] another [[G243]] horse [[G2462]] went forth. [[G1831]] [It was] bright red, [[G4450]] and [[G2532]] its rider [[G3588]] was granted permission [[G1325]] to take [[G2983]] peace [[G1515]] from [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] earth [[G1093]] and [[G2532]] to make men slay [[G4969]] one another. [[G240]] And [[G2532]] he [[G846]] was given [[G1325]] a great [[G3173]] sword. [[G3162]]

### 5
And [[G2532]] when [[G3753]] [the Lamb] opened [[G455]] the [[G3588]] third [[G5154]] seal, [[G4973]] I heard [[G191]] the [[G3588]] third [[G5154]] living creature [[G2226]] say, [[G3004]] “Come!” [[G2064]] Then [[G2532]] I looked [[G3708]] and [[G2532]] saw [[G2400]] a black [[G3189]] horse, [[G2462]] and [[G2532]] its rider [[G3588]] held [[G2192]] in [[G1722]] his [[G846]] hand [[G5495]] a pair of scales. [[G2218]]

### 6
And [[G2532]] I heard [[G191]] [ what sounded ] like [[G5613]] a voice [[G5456]] from among [[G3319]] the [[G3588]] four [[G5064]] living creatures, [[G2226]] saying, [[G3004]] “A quart [[G5518]] of wheat [[G4621]] for a denarius, [[G1220]] and [[G2532]] three [[G5140]] quarts [[G5518]] of barley [[G2915]] for a denarius, [[G1220]] and [[G2532]] do not waste [[G91]] the [[G3588]] oil [[G1637]] and [[G2532]] wine. [[G3631]]

### 7
And [[G2532]] when [[G3753]] [the Lamb] opened [[G455]] the [[G3588]] fourth [[G5067]] seal, [[G4973]] I heard [[G191]] [the] voice [[G5456]] of the [[G3588]] fourth [[G5067]] living creature [[G2226]] say, [[G3004]] “Come!” [[G2064]]

### 8
Then [[G2532]] I looked [[G3708]] and [[G2532]] saw [[G2400]] a pale [[G5515]] horse. [[G2462]] Its rider’s [[G3588]] name [[G3686]] [was] Death, [[G2288]] and [[G2532]] Hades [[G86]] followed [[G190]] close behind. [[G3326]] And [[G2532]] they [[G846]] were given [[G1325]] authority [[G1849]] over [[G1909]] a fourth [[G5067]] of the [[G3588]] earth, [[G1093]] to kill [[G615]] by [[G1722]] sword, [[G4501]] by [[G1722]] famine, [[G3042]] by [[G1722]] plague, [[G2288]] and [[G2532]] by the [[G3588]] beasts [[G2342]] of the [[G3588]] earth. [[G1093]]

### 9
And [[G2532]] when [[G3753]] [the Lamb] opened [[G455]] the [[G3588]] fifth [[G3991]] seal, [[G4973]] I saw [[G3708]] under [[G5270]] the [[G3588]] altar [[G2379]] the [[G3588]] souls [[G5590]] of those who [[G3588]] had been slain [[G4969]] for [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] word [[G3056]] of God [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] for [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] testimony [[G3141]] they had upheld. [[G2192]]

### 10
And [[G2532]] they cried out [[G2896]] in a loud voice, [[G5456]] “How long, [[G4219]] O [[G3588]] Lord, [[G1203]] holy [[G40]] and [[G2532]] true, [[G228]] until [[G2193]] You judge [[G2919]] those who [[G3588]] live [[G2730]] on [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] earth [[G1093]] and [[G2532]] avenge [[G1556]] our [[G1473]] blood?” [[G129]]

### 11
Then [[G2532]] each [[G1538]] of them [[G846]] was given [[G1325]] a white [[G3022]] robe [[G4749]] and [[G2532]] told [[G2046]] to [[G2443]] rest [[G373]] a little [[G3398]] while [[G5550]] longer, [[G2089]] until [[G2193]] the full number [[G4137]] of their [[G846]] fellow servants, [[G4889]] their [[G846]] brothers, [[G80]] were [[G3195]] killed, [[G615]] just as [[G5613]] they [[G846]] [had been killed]. [[G2532]]

### 12
And [[G2532]] when [[G3753]] I saw [[G3708]] [the Lamb] open [[G455]] the [[G3588]] sixth [[G1623]] seal, [[G4973]] there was [[G1096]] a great [[G3173]] earthquake, [[G4578]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] sun [[G2246]] became [[G1096]] black [[G3189]] like [[G5613]] sackcloth [[G4526]] [of goat] hair, [[G5155]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] whole [[G3650]] moon [[G4582]] turned [[G1096]] blood red, [[G129]]

### 13
and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] stars [[G792]] of [[G3588]] [the] sky [[G3772]] fell [[G4098]] to [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] earth, [[G1093]] like [[G5613]] unripe figs [[G3653]] dropping from [[G906]] a tree [[G4808]] shaken [[G4579]] by [[G5259]] a great [[G3173]] wind. [[G417]]

### 14
The [[G3588]] sky [[G3772]] receded [[G673]] like [[G5613]] a scroll [[G975]] being rolled up, [[G1667]] and [[G2532]] every [[G3956]] mountain [[G3735]] and [[G2532]] island [[G3520]] was moved [[G2795]] from [[G1537]] its [[G846]] place. [[G5117]]

### 15
Then [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] kings [[G935]] of the [[G3588]] earth, [[G1093]] the [[G3588]] nobles, [[G3175]] the [[G3588]] commanders, [[G5506]] the [[G3588]] rich, [[G4145]] the [[G3588]] mighty, [[G2478]] and [[G2532]] every [[G3956]] slave [[G1401]] and [[G2532]] free [man], [[G1658]] hid [[G2928]] in [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] caves [[G4693]] and [[G2532]] among [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] rocks [[G4073]] of the [[G3588]] mountains. [[G3735]]

### 16
And [[G2532]] they said [[G3004]] to the [[G3588]] mountains [[G3735]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] rocks, [[G4073]] “Fall [[G4098]] on [[G1909]] us [[G1473]] and [[G2532]] hide [[G2928]] us [[G1473]] from [[G575]] [the] face [[G4383]] of the [One] [[G3588]] seated [[G2521]] on [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] throne, [[G2362]] and [[G2532]] from [[G575]] the [[G3588]] wrath [[G3709]] of the [[G3588]] Lamb. [[G721]]

### 17
For [[G3754]] the [[G3588]] great [[G3173]] day [[G2250]] of [[G3588]] Their [[G846]] wrath [[G3709]] has come, [[G2064]] and [[G2532]] who [[G5101]] is able [[G1410]] to withstand [it]?” [[G2476]]
