### 1
Then [[G2532]] I saw [[G3708]] a scroll [[G975]] in [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] right hand [[G1188]] of the [One] [[G3588]] seated [[G2521]] on [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] throne. [[G2362]] It had writing [[G1125]] on both sides [[G2081]] [and was] sealed [[G2696]] with seven [[G2033]] seals. [[G4973]]

### 2
And [[G2532]] I saw [[G3708]] a mighty [[G2478]] angel [[G32]] proclaiming [[G2784]] in [[G1722]] a loud [[G3173]] voice, [[G5456]] “Who is [[G5101]] worthy [[G514]] to break [[G3089]] the [[G846]] seals [[G4973]] and [[G2532]] open [[G455]] the [[G3588]] scroll?” [[G975]]

### 3
[But] [[G2532]] no one [[G3762]] in [[G1722]] heaven [[G3772]] [or] [[G3761]] on [[G1909]] earth [[G1093]] [or] [[G3761]] under [[G5270]] the [[G3588]] earth [[G1093]] was able [[G1410]] to open [[G455]] the [[G3588]] scroll [[G975]] [or] [[G3777]] look inside [[G991]] it. [[G846]]

### 4
And [[G2532]] I [[G1473]] began to weep [[G2799]] bitterly, [[G4183]] because [[G3754]] no one [[G3762]] was found [[G2147]] worthy [[G514]] to open [[G455]] the [[G3588]] scroll [[G975]] [or] [[G3777]] look inside [[G991]] it. [[G846]]

### 5
Then [[G2532]] one [[G1520]] of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] elders [[G4245]] said [[G3004]] to me, [[G1473]] “{Do} not [[G3361]] weep! [[G2799]] Behold, [[G2400]] the [[G3588]] Lion [[G3023]] of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] tribe [[G5443]] of Judah, [[G2448]] the [[G3588]] root [[G4491]] of David, [[G1138]] has triumphed [[G3528]] to open [[G455]] the [[G3588]] scroll [[G975]] and [[G2532]] its [[G846]] seven [[G2033]] seals. [[G4973]]

### 6
Then [[G2532]] I saw [[G3708]] a Lamb [[G721]] who appeared [[G5613]] to have been slain, [[G4969]] standing [[G2476]] in [[G1722]] [the] center [[G3319]] of the [[G3588]] throne, [[G2362]] [encircled by] the [[G3588]] four [[G5064]] living creatures [[G2226]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] elders. [[G4245]] [The lamb] had [[G2192]] seven [[G2033]] horns [[G2768]] and [[G2532]] seven [[G2033]] eyes, [[G3788]] which [[G3739]] represent [[G1510]] the [[G3588]] sevenfold [[G2033]] Spirit [[G4151]] of God [[G2316]] sent out [[G649]] into [[G1519]] all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] earth. [[G1093]]

### 7
And [[G2532]] He came [[G2064]] and [[G2532]] took [the scroll] [[G2983]] from [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] right hand [[G1188]] of the [One] [[G3588]] seated [[G2521]] on [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] throne. [[G2362]]

### 8
When [[G3753]] He had taken [[G2983]] the [[G3588]] scroll, [[G975]] the [[G3588]] four [[G5064]] living creatures [[G2226]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] twenty-four [[G1501]] elders [[G4245]] fell down [[G4098]] before [[G1799]] the [[G3588]] Lamb. [[G721]] Each one [[G1538]] had [[G2192]] a harp, [[G2788]] and they were holding [[G2532]] golden [[G5552]] bowls [[G5357]] full [[G1073]] of incense, [[G2368]] which [[G3739]] are [[G1510]] the [[G3588]] prayers [[G4335]] of the [[G3588]] saints. [[G40]]

### 9
And [[G2532]] they sang [[G103]] a new [[G2537]] song: [[G5603]] “Worthy [[G514]] are You [[G1510]] to take [[G2983]] the [[G3588]] scroll [[G975]] and [[G2532]] open [[G455]] its [[G846]] seals, [[G4973]] because [[G3754]] You were slain, [[G4969]] and [[G2532]] by [[G1722]] Your [[G4771]] blood [[G129]] You purchased [[G59]] for God [[G2316]] [those] from [[G1537]] every [[G3956]] tribe [[G5443]] and [[G2532]] tongue [[G1100]] and [[G2532]] people [[G2992]] and [[G2532]] nation. [[G1484]]

### 10
You have made [[G4160]] them {into} [[G846]] a kingdom, [[G932]] priests [[G2409]] to [ serve ] [[G3588]] our [[G1473]] God, [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] they will reign [[G936]] upon [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] earth.” [[G1093]]

### 11
Then [[G2532]] I looked, [[G3708]] and [[G2532]] I heard [[G191]] [the] voices [[G5456]] of many [[G4183]] angels [[G32]] and [[G2532]] living creatures [[G2226]] and [[G2532]] elders [[G4245]] encircling [[G2945]] the [[G3588]] throne, [[G2362]] and [[G2532]] their [[G846]] number [[G706]] was [[G1510]] myriads [[G3461]] of myriads [[G3461]] and [[G2532]] thousands [[G5505]] of thousands. [[G5505]]

### 12
In a loud voice [[G5456]] they said: [[G3004]] “Worthy [[G514]] is [[G1510]] the [[G3588]] Lamb [[G721]] who [[G3588]] was slain, [[G4969]] to receive [[G2983]] power [[G1411]] and [[G2532]] riches [[G4149]] and [[G2532]] wisdom [[G4678]] and [[G2532]] strength [[G2479]] and [[G2532]] honor [[G5092]] and [[G2532]] glory [[G1391]] and [[G2532]] blessing! [[G2129]]

### 13
And [[G2532]] I heard [[G191]] every [[G3956]] creature [[G2938]] in [[G1722]] heaven, [[G3772]] and [[G2532]] on [[G1909]] earth, [[G1093]] and [[G2532]] under [[G5270]] the [[G3588]] earth, [[G1093]] and [[G2532]] in [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] sea, [[G2281]] and [[G2532]] all [[G3956]] that [is] [[G3588]] in [[G1722]] them, [[G846]] saying: [[G3004]] To Him who [[G3588]] sits [[G2521]] on [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] throne, [[G2362]] and [[G2532]] to the [[G3588]] Lamb, [[G721]] be [[G3588]] praise [[G2129]] and [[G2532]] honor [[G5092]] and [[G2532]] glory [[G1391]] and [[G2532]] power [[G2904]] forever [[G165]] [and] [[G3588]] ever! [[G165]]

### 14
And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] four [[G5064]] living creatures [[G2226]] said, [[G2036]] “Amen,” [[G281]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] elders [[G4245]] fell down [[G4098]] and [[G2532]] worshiped. [[G4352]]
