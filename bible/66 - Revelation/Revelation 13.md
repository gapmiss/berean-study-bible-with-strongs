### 1
Then [[G2532]] I saw [[G3708]] a beast [[G2342]] with [[G2192]] ten [[G1176]] horns [[G2768]] and [[G2532]] seven [[G2033]] heads [[G2776]] rising [[G305]] out of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] sea. [[G2281]] [There were] [[G2532]] ten [[G1176]] royal crowns [[G1238]] on [[G1909]] its [[G846]] horns [[G2768]] and [[G2532]] blasphemous [[G988]] names [[G3686]] on [[G1909]] its [[G846]] heads. [[G2776]]

### 2
The [[G3588]] beast [[G2342]] I saw [[G3708]] was [[G1510]] like [[G3664]] a leopard, [[G3917]] [with] [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] feet [[G4228]] of [[G5613]] a bear [[G715]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] mouth [[G4750]] of [[G5613]] a lion. [[G3023]] And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] dragon [[G1404]] gave [[G1325]] [the beast] [[G846]] his [[G846]] power [[G1411]] and [[G2532]] throne [[G2362]] and [[G2532]] great [[G3173]] authority. [[G1849]]

### 3
One [[G1520]] of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] heads [[G2776]] of [the beast] [[G846]] appeared [[G5613]] to be fatally wounded. [[G4969]] [But] [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] mortal [[G2288]] wound [[G4127]] was healed, [[G2323]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] whole [[G3650]] world [[G1093]] was astonished [[G2296]] [and] followed [[G3694]] the [[G3588]] beast. [[G2342]]

### 4
They worshiped [[G4352]] the [[G3588]] dragon [[G1404]] who [[G3754]] had given [[G1325]] authority [[G1849]] to the [[G3588]] beast, [[G2342]] and [[G2532]] they worshiped [[G4352]] the [[G3588]] beast, [[G2342]] saying, [[G3004]] “Who [[G5101]] [is] like [[G3664]] the [[G3588]] beast, [[G2342]] and [[G2532]] who [[G5101]] can [[G1410]] wage war [[G4170]] against [[G3326]] it? [[G846]]

### 5
[The beast] [[G846]] was given [[G1325]] a mouth [[G4750]] to speak [[G2980]] arrogant [[G3173]] and [[G2532]] blasphemous [words], [[G988]] and [[G2532]] authority [[G1849]] to act [[G4160]] for 42 [[G5062]] months. [[G3376]]

### 6
And [[G2532]] [the beast] opened [[G455]] its [[G846]] mouth [[G4750]] to [[G1519]] blaspheme [[G988]] against [[G4314]] God [[G2316]] [and] slander [[G987]] His [[G846]] name [[G3686]] and [[G2532]] His [[G846]] tabernacle— [[G4633]] those who [[G3588]] dwell [[G4637]] in [[G1722]] heaven. [[G3772]]

### 7
Then [[G2532]] [the beast] [[G846]] was permitted [[G1325]] to wage war [[G4171]] against [[G3326]] the [[G3588]] saints [[G40]] and [[G2532]] to conquer [[G3528]] them, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] it [[G846]] was given [[G1325]] authority [[G1849]] over [[G1909]] every [[G3956]] tribe [[G5443]] and [[G2532]] people [[G2992]] and [[G2532]] tongue [[G1100]] and [[G2532]] nation. [[G1484]]

### 8
And [[G2532]] all [[G3956]] who [[G3588]] dwell [[G2730]] on [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] earth [[G1093]] will worship [[G4352]] [the beast]— [[G846]] [all] whose [[G3739]] names [[G3686]] have not been written [[G1125]] from [[G575]] [the] foundation [[G2602]] of [the] world [[G2889]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] book [[G975]] of life [[G2222]] of the [[G3588]] Lamb [[G721]] who [[G3588]] was slain. [[G4969]]

### 9
He who [[G5100]] has [[G2192]] an ear, [[G3775]] let him hear: [[G191]]

### 10
“If [[G1487]] anyone [[G5100]] [is destined for] [[G1519]] captivity, [[G161]] into [[G1519]] captivity [[G161]] he will go; [[G5217]] if [[G1487]] anyone [[G5100]] is to die [[G615]] by [[G1722]] [the] sword, [[G3162]] by [[G1722]] [the] sword [[G3162]] he [[G846]] must [[G1163]] be killed.” [[G615]] Here [[G5602]] is [a call for] [[G1510]] the [[G3588]] perseverance [[G5281]] and [[G2532]] faith [[G4102]] of the [[G3588]] saints. [[G40]]

### 11
Then [[G2532]] I saw [[G3708]] another [[G243]] beast [[G2342]] rising [[G305]] out of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] earth. [[G1093]] [This beast] had [[G2192]] two [[G1417]] horns [[G2768]] like [[G3664]] a lamb, [[G721]] [but] [[G2532]] spoke [[G2980]] like [[G5613]] a dragon. [[G1404]]

### 12
And [[G2532]] [this beast] exercised [[G4160]] all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] authority [[G1849]] of the [[G3588]] first [[G4413]] beast [[G2342]] and [[G2532]] caused [[G4160]] the [[G3588]] earth [[G1093]] and [[G2532]] those who [[G3588]] dwell [[G2730]] in [[G1722]] it [[G846]] to [[G2443]] worship [[G4352]] the [[G3588]] first [[G4413]] beast, [[G2342]] whose [[G3739]] mortal [[G2288]] wound [[G4127]] had been healed. [[G2323]]

### 13
And [[G2532]] [the second beast] performed [[G4160]] great [[G3173]] signs [[G4592]] to [[G2443]] cause [[G4160]] even [[G2532]] fire [[G4442]] from [[G1537]] heaven [[G3772]] to come down [[G2597]] to [[G1519]] earth [[G1093]] in the presence [[G1799]] of the people. [[G444]]

### 14
Because of [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] signs [[G4592]] it [[G846]] was given [[G1325]] to perform [[G4160]] on behalf [[G1799]] of the [first] [[G3588]] beast, [[G2342]] it deceived [[G4105]] those who [[G3588]] dwell [[G2730]] on [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] earth, [[G1093]] telling [[G3004]] [them] [[G1093]] to make [[G4160]] an image [[G1504]] to the [[G3588]] beast [[G2342]] that [[G3739]] had been wounded [[G4127]] by the [[G3588]] sword [[G3162]] and yet [[G2532]] had lived. [[G2198]]

### 15
[The second beast] was permitted [[G1325]] to give [[G1325]] breath [[G4151]] to the [[G3588]] image [[G1504]] of the [[G3588]] [first] beast, [[G2342]] so that [[G2443]] the [[G3588]] image [[G1504]] could speak [[G2980]] and [[G2532]] cause [[G4160]] all who [[G3745]] refused to worship [[G4352]] [it] [[G2342]] to be killed. [[G615]]

### 16
And [[G2532]] [the second beast] required [[G4160]] all [[G3956]] [people] [[G3588]] small [[G3398]] and [[G2532]] great, [[G3173]] rich [[G4145]] and [[G2532]] poor, [[G4434]] free [[G1658]] and [[G2532]] slave, [[G1401]] to [[G2443]] receive [[G1325]] a mark [[G5480]] on [[G1909]] their [[G846]] right [[G1188]] hand [[G5495]] or [[G2228]] on [[G1909]] their [[G846]] forehead, [[G3359]]

### 17
so that [[G2443]] no [[G3361]] one [[G5100]] could [[G1410]] buy [[G59]] or [[G2228]] sell [[G4453]] unless [[G1487]] he [[G3588]] had [[G2192]] the [[G3588]] mark— [[G5480]] the [[G3588]] name [[G3686]] of the [[G3588]] beast [[G2342]] or [[G2228]] the [[G3588]] number [[G706]] of its [[G846]] name. [[G3686]]

### 18
Here [[G5602]] is [a call for] [[G1510]] wisdom: [[G4678]] {Let} the [one who] [[G3588]] has [[G2192]] insight [[G3563]] calculate [[G5585]] the [[G3588]] number [[G706]] of the [[G3588]] beast, [[G2342]] for [[G1063]] it is [[G1510]] [the] number [[G706]] of a man, [[G444]] and [[G2532]] [that] [[G846]] number [is] [[G706]] 666 {}. [[G1812]]
