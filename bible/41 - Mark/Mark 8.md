###### 1
In [[G1722]] those [[G1565]] days [[G2250]] [the] crowd [[G3793]] once again [[G3825]] became [[G1510]] very large, [[G4183]] and [[G2532]] they had [[G2192]] nothing [[G3361]] to eat. [[G5315]] [Jesus] called [[G4341]] the [[G3588]] disciples {to Him} [[G3101]] [and] said, [[G3004]]

###### 2
“I have compassion [[G4697]] for [[G1909]] [these] [[G3588]] people, [[G3793]] because [[G3754]] they have already been [[G4357]] with Me [[G1473]] three [[G5140]] days [[G2250]] and [[G2532]] have [[G2192]] nothing [[G3756]] to eat. [[G5315]]

###### 3
If [[G1437]] I send [[G630]] them [[G846]] home [[G3624]] hungry, [[G3523]] they will faint [[G1590]] along [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] way. [[G3598]] For [[G2532]] some [[G5100]] of them [[G846]] have come [[G2240]] a great distance.” [[G3113]]

###### 4
His [[G846]] disciples [[G3101]] replied, [[G611]] “Where [[G4159]] in [[G1909]] this desolate place [[G2047]] could [[G1410]] anyone [[G5100]] [find enough] bread [[G740]] to feed [[G5526]] all these [people]?” [[G3778]]

###### 5
“How many [[G4214]] loaves [[G740]] do you have?” [[G2192]] [Jesus] asked. [[G2065]] “Seven,” [[G2033]] they replied. [[G2036]]

###### 6
And [[G2532]] He directed [[G3853]] the [[G3588]] crowd [[G3793]] to sit down [[G377]] on [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] ground. [[G1093]] Then [[G2532]] He took [[G2983]] the [[G3588]] seven [[G2033]] loaves, [[G740]] gave thanks [[G2168]] [and] broke [them], [[G2806]] and [[G2532]] gave [them] [[G1325]] to [[G3588]] His [[G846]] disciples [[G3101]] to set before [the people]. [[G3908]] And [[G2532]] they distributed [them] [[G3908]] to the [[G3588]] crowd. [[G3793]]

###### 7
They also had [[G2192]] a few [[G3641]] small fish, [[G2485]] and [[G2532]] [Jesus] blessed [[G2127]] them [[G846]] [and] ordered that [[G2036]] these [[G3778]] be set before [them] [[G3908]] as well. [[G2532]]

###### 8
[The people] ate [[G5315]] and [[G2532]] were satisfied, [[G5526]] and [[G2532]] [the disciples] picked up [[G142]] seven [[G2033]] basketfuls [[G4711]] of broken pieces [[G2801]] that were left over. [[G4051]]

###### 9
And [[G1161]] about [[G5613]] four thousand [[G5070]] were [ fed ]. [[G1510]] As soon as [[G2532]] [Jesus] had dismissed [[G630]] [the crowd], [[G846]]

###### 10
He got [[G1684]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] boat [[G4143]] with [[G3326]] His [[G846]] disciples [[G3101]] [and] went [[G2064]] to [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] district [[G3313]] of Dalmanutha. [[G1148]]

###### 11
Then [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] Pharisees [[G5330]] came [[G1831]] and [[G2532]] began [[G756]] to argue with [[G4802]] [Jesus]. [[G846]] They tested [[G3985]] Him [[G846]] [by] demanding [[G2212]] from [[G3844]] Him [[G846]] a sign [[G4592]] from [[G575]] heaven. [[G3772]]

###### 12
[Jesus] sighed deeply [[G389]] in [[G3588]] His [[G846]] spirit [[G4151]] [and] said, [[G3004]] “Why [[G5101]] {does] this [[G3778]] generation [[G1074]] demand [[G2212]] a sign? [[G4592]] Truly [[G281]] I tell [[G3004]] you, [[G4771]] no [[G1487]] sign [[G4592]] will be given [[G1325]] to this [[G3778]] generation.” [[G1074]]

###### 13
Then [[G2532]] He left [[G863]] them, [[G846]] got back into the boat, [[G1684]] [and] crossed [[G565]] to [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] other side. [[G4008]]

###### 14
Now [[G2532]] [the disciples] had forgotten [[G1950]] to take [[G2983]] bread, [[G740]] except for [[G1487]] one [[G1520]] loaf [[G740]] they had [[G2192]] with [[G3326]] them [[G1438]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] boat. [[G4143]]

###### 15
“Watch out!” [[G3708]] He cautioned [[G1291]] them. [[G846]] “Beware [[G991]] of [[G575]] the [[G3588]] yeast [[G2219]] of the [[G3588]] Pharisees [[G5330]] and [[G2532]] of Herod.” [[G2264]]

###### 16
[So] [[G2532]] they began to discuss [[G1260]] with [[G4314]] one another [[G240]] the fact that [[G3754]] they had [[G2192]] no [[G3756]] bread. [[G740]]

###### 17
Aware of [their conversation], [[G1097]] [Jesus] asked [[G3004]] them, [[G846]] “Why [[G5101]] are you debating [[G1260]] about [[G3754]] having [[G2192]] no [[G3756]] bread? [[G740]] Do you still not see [[G3539]] or [[G3761]] understand? [[G4920]] Do you have [[G2192]] such hard [[G4456]] hearts? [[G2588]]

###### 18
‘Having [[G2192]] eyes, [[G3788]] do you not see? [[G991]] And [[G2532]] having [[G2192]] ears, [[G3775]] do you not hear?’ [[G191]] And [[G2532]] do you not remember? [[G3421]]

###### 19
When [[G3753]] I broke [[G2806]] the [[G3588]] five [[G4002]] loaves [[G740]] for [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] five thousand, [[G4000]] how many [[G4214]] basketfuls [[G2894]] of broken pieces [[G2801]] did you collect?” [[G142]] “Twelve,” [[G1427]] they answered. [[G3004]]

###### 20
“And [[G2532]] when [I broke] [[G3753]] the [[G3588]] seven [loaves] [[G2033]] for [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] four thousand, [[G5070]] how many [[G4214]] basketfuls [[G4711]] of broken pieces [[G2801]] did you collect?” [[G142]] “Seven,” [[G2033]] they [[G846]] said. [[G3004]]

###### 21
Then [[G2532]] He asked [[G2036]] them, [[G846]] “Do you still not understand?” [[G4920]]

###### 22
[When] [[G2532]] they arrived [[G2064]] at [[G1519]] Bethsaida, [[G966]] [some people] brought [[G5342]] a blind [man] [[G5185]] and [[G2532]] begged [[G3870]] [Jesus] [[G846]] to [[G2443]] touch [[G680]] him. [[G846]]

###### 23
So [[G2532]] He took [[G1949]] the [[G3588]] blind [man] [[G5185]] by the [[G3588]] hand [[G5495]] [and] led him [[G1627]] out [[G1854]] of the [[G3588]] village. [[G2968]] Then [[G2532]] He spit [[G4429]] on [[G1519]] [the man’s] [[G846]] eyes [[G3659]] [and] placed [[G2007]] [His] [[G3588]] hands [[G5495]] on him. [[G846]] “Can you see [[G991]] anything? [[G5100]] He asked. [[G1905]]

###### 24
[The man] looked up [[G308]] [and] said, [[G2036]] “I can see [[G991]] the [[G3588]] people, [[G444]] [but] [[G3754]] they look [[G3708]] like [[G5613]] trees [[G1186]] walking around.” [[G4043]]

###### 25
Once again [[G1534]] [Jesus] placed [[G2007]] [His] [[G3588]] hands [[G5495]] on [[G1909]] [the man’s] [[G846]] eyes, [[G3788]] and when [[G2532]] he opened them [[G1227]] [his sight] was restored, [[G600]] and [[G2532]] he could see [[G1689]] everything [[G537]] clearly. [[G5081]]

###### 26
[Jesus] sent [[G649]] him [[G846]] home [[G3624]] [and] said, [[G3004]] “Do not go back [[G1525]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] village.” [[G2968]]

###### 27
Then [[G2532]] Jesus [[G2424]] and [[G2532]] His [[G846]] disciples [[G3101]] went on [[G1831]] to [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] villages [[G2968]] around Caesarea [[G2542]] Philippi. [[G5376]] On [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] way, [[G3598]] He questioned [[G1905]] His [[G846]] disciples: [[G3101]] “Who [[G5101]] {do} people [[G444]] say [[G3004]] I [[G1473]] am? [[G1510]]

###### 28
They answered, [[G2036]] “[Some say] John [[G2491]] the [[G3588]] Baptist; [[G910]] others [say] [[G243]] Elijah; [[G2243]] and still [[G1161]] others [say You are] [[G243]] one [[G1520]] of the [[G3588]] prophets.” [[G4396]]

###### 29
“But [[G1161]] who [[G5101]] {do} you [[G4771]] say [[G3004]] I [[G1473]] am?” [[G1510]] He [[G846]] asked. [[G1905]] Peter [[G4074]] answered, [[G611]] “You [[G4771]] are [[G1510]] the [[G3588]] Christ.” [[G5547]]

###### 30
And [[G2532]] [Jesus] warned [[G2008]] them [[G846]] not to tell anyone [[G3004]] about [[G4012]] Him. [[G846]]

###### 31
Then [[G2532]] He began [[G756]] to teach [[G1321]] them [[G846]] that [[G3754]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of Man [[G444]] must [[G1163]] suffer [[G3958]] many things [[G4183]] and [[G2532]] be rejected [[G593]] by [[G5259]] the [[G3588]] elders, [[G4245]] chief priests, [[G749]] and [[G2532]] scribes, [[G1122]] and [[G2532]] [that] He must be killed [[G615]] and [[G2532]] after [[G3326]] three [[G5140]] days [[G2250]] rise [again]. [[G450]]

###### 32
He spoke [[G2980]] [this] [[G3588]] message [[G3056]] quite frankly, [[G3954]] and [[G2532]] Peter [[G4074]] took Him aside [[G4355]] [and] began [[G756]] to rebuke [[G2008]] Him. [[G846]]

###### 33
Turning [[G1994]] and [[G2532]] looking at [[G3708]] His [[G846]] disciples, [[G3101]] [Jesus] rebuked [[G2008]] Peter [[G4074]] and [[G2532]] said, [[G3004]] “Get [[G5217]] behind [[G3694]] Me, [[G1473]] Satan! [[G4567]] For [[G3754]] you do not have in mind [[G5426]] the [[G3588]] things [[G3588]] of God, [[G2316]] but [[G235]] the [[G3588]] things [[G3588]] of men. [[G444]]

###### 34
Then [[G2532]] [Jesus] called [[G4341]] the [[G3588]] crowd {to Him} [[G3793]] along with [[G4862]] His [[G846]] disciples, [[G3101]] [and] He told [[G2036]] them, [[G846]] “If [[G1487]] anyone [[G5100]] wants [[G2309]] to come [[G2064]] after [[G3694]] Me, [[G1473]] he must deny [[G533]] himself [[G1438]] and [[G2532]] take up [[G142]] his [[G846]] cross [[G4716]] and [[G2532]] follow [[G190]] Me. [[G1473]]

###### 35
For [[G1063]] whoever [[G3739]] wants [[G2309]] to save [[G4982]] his [[G846]] life [[G5590]] will lose [[G622]] it, [[G846]] but [[G1161]] whoever [[G3739]] loses [[G622]] his [[G846]] life [[G5590]] for My sake [[G1752]] and [[G2532]] for the [[G3588]] gospel [[G2098]] will save [[G4982]] it. [[G846]]

###### 36
What [[G5101]] does it profit [[G5623]] a man [[G444]] to gain [[G2770]] the [[G3588]] whole [[G3650]] world, [[G2889]] yet [[G2532]] forfeit [[G2210]] his [[G846]] soul? [[G5590]]

###### 37
Or [[G1063]] what [[G5101]] {can} a man [[G444]] give [[G1325]] in exchange [[G465]] for [[G3588]] his [[G846]] soul? [[G5590]]

###### 38
For [[G1063]] whoever [[G3739]] is ashamed of [[G1870]] Me [[G1473]] and [[G2532]] My [[G1699]] words [[G3056]] in [[G1722]] this [[G3778]] adulterous [[G3428]] and [[G2532]] sinful [[G268]] generation, [[G1074]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of Man [[G444]] will also be ashamed of [[G1870]] him [[G846]] when [[G3752]] He comes [[G2064]] in [[G1722]] His [[G846]] Fathers [[G3962]] glory [[G1391]] with [[G3326]] the [[G3588]] holy [[G40]] angels.
