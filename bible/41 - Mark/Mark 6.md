### 1
[Jesus] went on [[G1831]] from there [[G1564]] and [[G2532]] came [[G2064]] to [[G1519]] His [[G846]] hometown, [[G3968]] accompanied by [[G190]] His [[G846]] disciples. [[G3101]]

### 2
[When] [[G2532]] [the] Sabbath [[G4521]] came, [[G1096]] He began [[G756]] to teach [[G1321]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] synagogue, [[G4864]] and [[G2532]] many [[G4183]] who heard [Him] [[G191]] were astonished. [[G1605]] “Where [did] [[G4159]] this [man get] [[G3778]] these [ideas]?” [[G3778]] they asked. [[G3004]] “What [is] [[G5101]] [this] [[G3588]] wisdom [[G4678]] He has been given? [[G1325]] And [how can] [[G2532]] He perform [[G1096]] such [[G5108]] miracles? [[G1411]]

### 3
Isn’t [[G1510]] this [[G3778]] the [[G3588]] carpenter, [[G5045]] the [[G3588]] son [[G5207]] of Mary [[G3137]] and [[G2532]] [the] brother [[G80]] of James, [[G2385]] Joseph, [[G2500]] Judas, [[G2455]] and [[G2532]] Simon? [[G4613]] Aren’t [[G1510]] His [[G846]] sisters [[G79]] here [[G5602]] with [[G4314]] us [[G1473]] as well? [[G2532]] And [[G2532]] they took offense [[G4624]] at [[G1722]] Him. [[G846]]

### 4
Then [[G2532]] Jesus [[G2424]] told [[G2036]] them, [[G846]] “A prophet [[G4396]] is [[G1510]] without honor [[G820]] only [[G1487]] in [[G1722]] his [[G846]] hometown, [[G3968]] among [[G1722]] his [[G846]] relatives, [[G4773]] and [[G2532]] in [[G1722]] his [[G846]] [own] [[G3588]] household.” [[G3614]]

### 5
[So] [[G2532]] He could not [[G1410]] perform [[G4160]] [any] [[G3762]] miracles [[G1411]] there, [[G1563]] except [[G1487]] to lay [[G2007]] [His] [[G3588]] hands [[G5495]] on a few [[G3641]] of the sick [[G732]] [and] heal [them]. [[G2323]]

### 6
And [[G2532]] amazed [[G2296]] at [[G1223]] their [[G846]] unbelief, [[G570]] He went [[G4013]] around [[G2945]] teaching [[G1321]] from village to village. [[G2968]]

### 7
Then [[G2532]] [Jesus] called [[G4341]] the [[G3588]] Twelve {to Him} [[G1427]] and [[G2532]] began [[G756]] to send them out [[G649]] two [[G1417]] [by] two, [[G1417]] giving [[G1325]] them [[G846]] authority [[G1849]] over [[G3588]] unclean [[G169]] spirits. [[G4151]]

### 8
He instructed [[G3853]] them [[G846]] to [[G2443]] take [[G142]] nothing [[G3367]] but [[G1487]] a staff [[G4464]] for [[G1519]] [the] journey— [[G3598]] no [[G3361]] bread, [[G740]] no [[G3361]] bag, [[G4082]] no [[G3361]] money [[G5475]] in [[G1519]] their [[G3588]] belts— [[G2223]]

### 9
[and] [[G235]] to wear [[G5265]] sandals, [[G4547]] [but] [[G2532]] not [[G3361]] a second [[G1417]] tunic. [[G5509]]

### 10
And [[G2532]] He told [[G2036]] them, [[G846]] “When [[G3699]] you enter [[G1525]] a house, [[G3614]] stay [[G3306]] there [[G1563]] until [[G2193]] you leave [[G1831]] [that town]. [[G1564]]

### 11
If [[G3739]] anyone [[G302]] will not welcome [[G1209]] you [[G4771]] or [[G3366]] listen to [[G191]] you, [[G4771]] shake [[G1621]] the [[G3588]] dust [[G5522]] off [[G5270]] your [[G4771]] feet [[G4228]] when you leave [[G1607]] that [[G1564]] place, [[G5117]] as [[G1519]] a testimony [[G3142]] against them.” [[G846]]

### 12
[So] [[G2532]] they went out [[G1831]] [and] preached [[G2784]] that [[G2443]] [the people] should repent. [[G3340]]

### 13
They also drove out [[G1544]] many [[G4183]] demons [[G1140]] and [[G2532]] healed [[G2323]] many [[G4183]] of the sick, [[G732]] anointing [them] [[G218]] with oil. [[G1637]]

### 14
Now [[G2532]] King [[G935]] Herod [[G2264]] heard about this, [[G191]] for [[G1063]] [Jesus’] [[G846]] name [[G3686]] had become [[G1096]] well known, [[G5318]] and [[G2532]] [people] were saying, [[G2036]] “John [[G2491]] the [[G3588]] Baptist [[G907]] has risen [[G1453]] from [[G1537]] [the] dead! [[G3498]] That [[G3778]] is why [[G1223]] miraculous powers [[G1411]] are at work [[G1754]] in [[G1722]] him. [[G846]]

### 15
Others [[G243]] said, [[G2036]] “He is [[G1510]] Elijah,” [[G2243]] and [[G1161]] still others, [[G243]] “[He is] a prophet, [[G4396]] like [[G5613]] one [[G1520]] of the [[G3588]] prophets [of old].” [[G4396]]

### 16
But when [[G1161]] Herod [[G2264]] heard this, [[G191]] he said, [[G2036]] “John, [[G2491]] whom [[G3739]] I [[G1473]] beheaded, [[G607]] has been raised [from the dead]!” [[G1453]]

### 17
For [[G1063]] Herod [[G2264]] himself [[G846]] had ordered [[G649]] that [[G3588]] John [[G2491]] be arrested [[G2902]] and [[G2532]] bound [[G1210]] [and] imprisoned, [[G5438]] on account of [[G1223]] his [[G846]] brother [[G80]] Philip’s [[G5376]] wife [[G1135]] Herodias, [[G2266]] [whom] [[G846]] [Herod] had married. [[G1060]]

### 18
For [[G1063]] John [[G2491]] had been telling [[G2036]] Herod, [[G2264]] “It is not lawful [[G1832]] for you [[G4771]] to have [[G2192]] your [[G4771]] brother’s [[G80]] wife!” [[G1135]]

### 19
So [[G1161]] Herodias [[G2266]] held a grudge [[G1758]] against [John] [[G846]] and [[G2532]] wanted [[G2309]] to kill [[G615]] him. [[G846]] But [[G2532]] she had been unable, [[G1410]]

### 20
because [[G1063]] Herod [[G2264]] feared [[G5399]] John [[G2491]] and [[G2532]] protected [[G4933]] him, [[G846]] knowing [[G1492]] he [was] [[G846]] a righteous [[G1342]] and [[G2532]] holy [[G40]] man. [[G435]] When [[G2532]] he heard [[G191]] [John’s words], [[G846]] he was greatly perplexed; [[G639]] yet [[G2532]] he listened [[G191]] to him [[G846]] gladly. [[G2234]]

### 21
On [[G3588]] [Herod’s] [[G846]] birthday, [[G1077]] [her] opportunity [[G2121]] arose. [[G1096]] Herod [[G2264]] held [[G4160]] a banquet [[G1173]] for [[G3588]] his [[G846]] nobles [[G3175]] and [[G2532]] military commanders, [[G5506]] as well as [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] leading [men] [[G4413]] of Galilee. [[G1056]]

### 22
[When] [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] daughter [[G2364]] of Herodias [[G2266]] came [[G1525]] and [[G2532]] danced, [[G3738]] she pleased [[G700]] Herod [[G2264]] and [[G2532]] his guests, [[G4873]] and [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] king [[G935]] said [[G2036]] to the [[G3588]] girl, [[G2877]] “Ask [[G154]] me [[G1473]] for whatever [[G3739]] you wish, [[G2309]] and [[G2532]] I will give [it] [[G1325]] to you. [[G4771]]

### 23
And [[G2532]] he swore [[G3660]] to her, [[G846]] “Whatever [[G4183]] you ask [[G154]] of me, [[G1473]] I will give [[G1325]] you, [[G4771]] up to [[G2193]] half [[G2255]] my [[G1473]] kingdom!” [[G932]]

### 24
Then [[G2532]] she went out [[G1831]] [and] said [[G2036]] to her [[G846]] mother, [[G3384]] “What [[G5101]] should I ask for?” [[G154]] And [[G1161]] [Herodias] answered, [[G2036]] “The [[G3588]] head [[G2776]] of John [[G2491]] the [[G3588]] Baptist.” [[G907]]

### 25
At once [[G2112]] [the girl] hurried back [[G1525]] to [[G4314]] the [[G3588]] king [[G935]] with her request: [[G154]] “I want [[G2309]] you to give [[G1325]] me [[G1473]] the [[G3588]] head [[G2776]] of John [[G2491]] the [[G3588]] Baptist [[G910]] on [[G1909]] a platter [[G4094]] immediately.” [[G1824]]

### 26
The [[G3588]] king [[G935]] was [[G1096]] overwhelmed with sorrow, [[G4036]] but because of [[G1223]] [his] [[G3588]] oaths [[G3727]] and [[G2532]] his guests, [[G345]] he did not want [[G2309]] to refuse [[G114]] her. [[G846]]

### 27
So [[G2532]] without delay, [[G2112]] the [[G3588]] king [[G935]] commanded that [[G2004]] John’s [[G846]] head [[G2776]] be brought in. [[G5342]] He sent [[G649]] an executioner [[G4688]] who went [[G565]] [and] beheaded [[G607]] him [[G846]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] prison. [[G5438]]

### 28
[The man] brought [[G5342]] [John’s] [[G3588]] head [[G2776]] on [[G1909]] a platter [[G4094]] and [[G2532]] presented [[G1325]] it [[G846]] to the [[G3588]] girl, [[G2877]] [who] [[G2877]] gave [[G1325]] it [[G846]] to her [[G846]] mother. [[G3384]]

### 29
When [[G2532]] [John’s] [[G846]] disciples [[G3101]] heard about [this], [[G191]] they came [[G2064]] and [[G2532]] took [[G142]] his [[G846]] body [[G4430]] and [[G2532]] laid [[G5087]] it [[G846]] in [[G1722]] [a] tomb. [[G3419]]

### 30
Meanwhile, [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] apostles [[G652]] gathered [[G4863]] around [[G4314]] Jesus [[G2424]] and [[G2532]] brought Him news [[G518]] of all [[G3956]] they had done [[G4160]] and [[G2532]] taught. [[G1321]]

### 31
And [[G2532]] He said [[G3004]] to them, [[G846]] “Come [[G1205]] with Me [[G2596]] privately [[G846]] to [[G1519]] [a] solitary [[G2048]] place, [[G5117]] and [[G2532]] let us rest [[G373]] for a while.” [[G3641]] For [[G1063]] many [people] [[G4183]] were [[G1510]] coming [[G2064]] and [[G2532]] going, [[G5217]] and [[G2532]] they did not even have time [[G2119]] to eat. [[G5315]]

### 32
So [[G2532]] they went away [[G565]] in [[G1722]] a boat [[G4143]] by [[G2596]] themselves [[G2398]] to [[G1519]] a solitary [[G2048]] place. [[G5117]]

### 33
But [[G2532]] many [people] [[G4183]] saw [[G3708]] them [[G846]] leaving [[G5217]] and [[G2532]] recognized [them]. [[G1921]] They ran together [[G4936]] on foot [[G3979]] from [[G575]] all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] towns [[G4172]] and [[G2532]] arrived before [[G4281]] them. [[G846]]

### 34
When [[G2532]] [Jesus] stepped ashore [[G1831]] [and] saw [[G3708]] a large [[G4183]] crowd, [[G3793]] He had compassion [[G4697]] on [[G1909]] them, [[G846]] because [[G3754]] they were [[G1510]] like [[G5613]] sheep [[G4263]] without [[G2192]] a shepherd. [[G4166]] And [[G2532]] He began [[G756]] to teach [[G1321]] them [[G846]] many things. [[G4183]]

### 35
By now [[G2532]] the hour [[G5610]] was [[G1096]] already [[G2235]] late. [[G4183]] [So] the [[G3588]] disciples [[G3101]] came [[G4334]] to [Jesus] [[G846]] [and] said, [[G2036]] “This [[G3588]] is [[G1510]] a desolate [[G2048]] place, [[G5117]] and [[G2532]] the hour [[G5610]] [is] already [[G2235]] late. [[G4183]]

### 36
Dismiss [[G630]] [the crowd] [[G846]] so [[G2443]] they can go [[G565]] to [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] surrounding [[G2945]] countryside [[G68]] and [[G2532]] villages [[G2968]] [and] buy [[G59]] themselves [[G1438]] something [[G5101]] to eat.” [[G5315]]

### 37
But [[G1161]] [Jesus] told [[G611]] them, [[G846]] “You [[G4771]] give [[G1325]] them [[G846]] [something] to eat.” [[G5315]] They asked [[G3004]] Him, [[G846]] “Should we go out [[G565]] [and] spend [[G59]] two hundred [[G1250]] denarii [[G1220]] to give [[G1325]] all of them [[G846]] bread [[G740]] to eat?” [[G5315]]

### 38
“Go [[G5217]] [and] see [[G3708]] how many [[G4214]] loaves [[G740]] you have,” [[G2192]] He told [[G3004]] them. [[G846]] And [[G2532]] after checking [[G1097]] they said, [[G3004]] “Five, [[G4002]] and [[G2532]] two [[G1417]] fish.” [[G2486]]

### 39
Then [[G2532]] [Jesus] directed [[G2004]] them [[G846]] to have [the people] sit [[G347]] in groups [[G4849]] on [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] green [[G5515]] grass. [[G5528]]

### 40
So [[G2532]] they sat down [[G377]] in groups [[G4237]] of [[G2596]] hundreds [[G1540]] and [[G2532]] fifties. [[G4004]]

### 41
Taking [[G2983]] the [[G3588]] five [[G4002]] loaves [[G740]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] two [[G1417]] fish [[G2486]] [and] looking up [[G308]] to [[G1519]] heaven, [[G3772]] [Jesus] spoke a blessing [[G2127]] and [[G2532]] broke [[G2622]] the [[G3588]] loaves. [[G740]] Then [[G2532]] He gave [them] [[G1325]] to [[G3588]] His [[G846]] disciples [[G3101]] to [[G2443]] set before [[G3908]] [the people]. [[G846]] And [[G2532]] He divided [[G3307]] the [[G3588]] two [[G1417]] fish [[G2486]] among them all. [[G3956]]

### 42
{They} all [[G3956]] ate [[G5315]] and [[G2532]] were satisfied, [[G5526]]

### 43
and [[G2532]] [the disciples] picked up [[G142]] twelve [[G1427]] basketfuls [[G2894]] of broken pieces of bread [[G2801]] and [[G2532]] fish. [[G2486]]

### 44
And [[G2532]] there were [[G1510]] five thousand [[G4000]] men [[G435]] who [[G3588]] ate [[G5315]] the [[G3588]] loaves. [[G740]]

### 45
Immediately [[G2112]] [Jesus] made [[G315]] His [[G846]] disciples [[G3101]] get [[G1684]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] boat [[G4143]] and [[G2532]] cross over ahead of [Him] [[G4254]] to [[G4314]] Bethsaida, [[G966]] while [[G2193]] He [[G846]] dismissed [[G630]] the [[G3588]] crowd. [[G3793]]

### 46
After bidding them farewell, [[G657]] He went [[G565]] up on [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] mountain [[G3735]] to pray. [[G4336]]

### 47
When [[G2532]] evening [[G3798]] came, [[G1096]] the [[G3588]] boat [[G4143]] was [[G1510]] in [[G1722]] the middle [[G3319]] of the [[G3588]] sea, [[G2281]] and [[G2532]] [Jesus was] [[G846]] alone [[G3441]] on [[G1909]] land. [[G1093]]

### 48
He could see that [[G3708]] [the disciples] [[G846]] were straining [[G928]] to row, [[G1643]] because [[G1063]] the [[G3588]] wind [[G417]] was [[G1510]] against [[G1727]] them. [[G846]] About [[G4012]] [the] fourth [[G5067]] watch [[G5438]] of the [[G3588]] night, [[G3571]] [Jesus] went out [[G2064]] to [[G4314]] them, [[G846]] walking [[G4043]] on [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] sea. [[G2281]] He intended [[G2309]] to pass by [[G3928]] them, [[G846]]

### 49
but [[G1161]] when they saw [[G3708]] Him [[G846]] walking [[G4043]] on [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] sea, [[G2281]] they cried out, [[G349]] thinking [[G1380]] [He] was [[G1510]] a ghost— [[G5326]]

### 50
for [[G1063]] they all [[G3956]] saw Him [[G3708]] and [[G2532]] were terrified. [[G5015]] But [[G1161]] [Jesus] spoke up [[G2980]] at once: [[G2112]] “Take courage! [[G2293]] [It] is [[G1510]] I. [[G1473]] {Do} not [[G3361]] be afraid.” [[G5399]]

### 51
Then [[G2532]] He climbed [[G305]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] boat [[G4143]] with [[G4314]] them, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] wind [[G417]] died down. [[G2869]] And [[G2532]] [the disciples were] utterly [[G3029]] astounded, [[G1839]]

### 52
for [[G1063]] they had not understood [[G4920]] about [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] loaves, [[G740]] but [[G235]] their [[G846]] hearts [[G2588]] had been [[G1510]] hardened. [[G4456]]

### 53
When [[G2532]] they had crossed over, [[G1276]] they landed [[G2064]] at [[G1519]] Gennesaret, [[G1082]] [where] they moored the boat. [[G4358]]

### 54
As soon as [[G2112]] they [[G846]] got [[G1831]] out of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] boat, [[G4143]] [the people] recognized [[G1921]] [Jesus] [[G846]]

### 55
[and] ran through [[G4063]] that [[G1565]] whole [[G3650]] region, [[G5561]] carrying [[G4064]] the [[G3588]] sick [[G2560]] on [[G1909]] mats [[G2895]] to wherever [[G3699]] they heard [[G191]] He was. [[G1510]]

### 56
And [[G2532]] wherever [[G3699]] He went— [[G1531]] villages [[G2968]] [and] [[G2228]] towns [[G4172]] [and] [[G2228]] countrysides— [[G68]] they laid [[G5087]] the [[G3588]] sick [[G770]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] marketplaces [[G58]] and [[G2532]] begged [[G3870]] Him [[G846]] to let them just touch [[G680]] the [[G3588]] fringe [[G2899]] of His [[G846]] cloak. [[G2440]] And [[G2532]] all [[G3745]] who [[G302]] touched [[G680]] Him [[G846]] were healed. [[G4982]]
