[[Matthew 28|←]] • [[Mark 2|→]]

###### 1
[This is the] beginning [[G746]] of the [[G3588]] gospel [[G2098]] of Jesus [[G2424]] Christ, [[G5547]] [the] Son [[G5207]] of God. [[G2316]]

###### 2
As [[G2531]] it is written [[G1125]] in [[G1722]] Isaiah [[G2268]] the [[G3588]] prophet: [[G4396]] “Behold, [[G2400]] I will send [[G649]] My [[G1473]] messenger [[G32]] ahead of You, [[G4253]] who [[G3739]] will prepare [[G2680]] Your [[G4771]] way.” [[G3598]]

###### 3
“A voice [[G5456]] of one calling [[G994]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] wilderness, [[G2048]] ‘Prepare [[G2090]] the [[G3588]] way [[G3598]] for [the] Lord, [[G2962]] make [[G4160]] straight [[G2117]] paths [[G5147]] for Him.’” [[G846]]

###### 4
John [[G2491]] the [[G3588]] Baptist [[G907]] appeared [[G1096]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] wilderness, [[G2048]] preaching [[G2784]] [a] baptism [[G908]] of repentance [[G3341]] for [[G1519]] [the] forgiveness [[G859]] of sins. [[G266]]

###### 5
[People] went out [[G1607]] to [[G4314]] him [[G846]] from all [[G3956]] of Jerusalem [[G2415]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] countryside [[G5561]] of Judea. [[G2449]] Confessing [[G1843]] their [[G846]] sins, [[G266]] they were baptized [[G907]] by [[G5259]] him [[G846]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] Jordan [[G2446]] River. [[G4215]]

###### 6
John [[G2491]] was [[G1510]] clothed in [[G1746]] camel’s [[G2574]] hair, [[G2359]] with [[G2532]] a leather [[G1193]] belt [[G2223]] around [[G4012]] his [[G846]] waist. [[G3751]] His food was [[G2068]] locusts [[G200]] and [[G2532]] wild [[G66]] honey. [[G3192]]

###### 7
And [[G2532]] he began to proclaim: [[G2784]] “After [[G3694]] me [[G1473]] will come [[G2064]] One [[G3588]] more powerful [[G2478]] than I, [[G1473]] the [[G3588]] straps [[G2438]] of [[G3588]] whose [[G3739]] sandals [[G5266]] I am [[G1510]] not [[G3756]] worthy [[G2425]] to stoop down [[G2955]] [and] untie. [[G3089]]

###### 8
I [[G1473]] baptize [[G907]] you [[G4771]] [with] water, [[G5204]] but [[G1161]] He [[G846]] will baptize [[G907]] you [[G4771]] with [[G1722]] [the] Holy [[G40]] Spirit.” [[G4151]]

###### 9
In [[G1722]] those [[G1565]] days [[G2250]] Jesus [[G2424]] came [[G2064]] from [[G575]] Nazareth [[G3478]] in Galilee [[G1056]] and [[G2532]] was baptized [[G907]] by [[G5259]] John [[G2491]] in [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] Jordan. [[G2446]]

###### 10
As soon [as Jesus] [[G2112]] came up [[G305]] out of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] water, [[G5204]] he saw [[G3708]] the [[G3588]] heavens [[G3772]] breaking open [[G4977]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] Spirit [[G4151]] descending [[G2597]] on [[G1519]] Him [[G846]] like [[G5613]] a dove. [[G4058]]

###### 11
And [[G2532]] a voice [[G5456]] came [[G1096]] from [[G1537]] heaven: [[G3772]] “You [[G4771]] are [[G1510]] My [[G1473]] beloved [[G27]] Son; [[G5207]] in [[G1722]] You [[G4771]] I am well pleased.” [[G2106]]

###### 12
At once [[G2112]] the [[G3588]] Spirit [[G4151]] drove [Jesus] [[G1544]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] wilderness, [[G2048]]

###### 13
and [[G2532]] He was [[G1510]] [there] [[G2048]] for forty [[G5062]] days, [[G2250]] being tempted [[G3985]] by [[G5259]] Satan. [[G4567]] He was [[G1510]] with [[G3326]] the [[G3588]] wild animals, [[G2342]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] angels [[G32]] ministered [[G1247]] to Him. [[G846]]

###### 14
After [[G3326]] the [[G3588]] arrest [[G3860]] of John, [[G2491]] Jesus [[G2424]] went [[G2064]] into [[G1519]] Galilee [[G1056]] [and] proclaimed [[G2784]] the [[G3588]] gospel [[G2098]] of God. [[G2316]]

###### 15
“The [[G3588]] time [[G2540]] is fulfilled,” [[G4137]] He said, [[G3004]] “and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] of God [[G2316]] is near. [[G1448]] Repent [[G3340]] and [[G2532]] believe [[G4100]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] gospel!” [[G2098]]

###### 16
As [[G2532]] [Jesus] was walking [[G3855]] beside [[G3844]] the [[G3588]] Sea [[G2281]] of Galilee, [[G1056]] He saw [[G3708]] Simon [[G4613]] and [[G2532]] [his] [[G4613]] brother [[G80]] Andrew. [[G406]] They were casting a net [[G906]] into [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] sea, [[G2281]] for [[G1063]] they were [[G1510]] fishermen. [[G231]]

###### 17
“Come, follow [[G1205]] Me,” [[G1473]] Jesus [[G2424]] said, [[G2036]] “and [[G2532]] I will make [[G4160]] you [[G4771]] fishers [[G231]] of men.” [[G444]]

###### 18
And [[G2532]] at once [[G2112]] they left [[G863]] [their] [[G3588]] nets [[G1350]] [and] followed [[G190]] Him. [[G846]]

###### 19
Going on [[G4260]] a little farther, [[G3641]] He saw [[G3708]] James [[G2385]] [son] [[G3588]] of Zebedee [[G2199]] and [[G2532]] his [[G846]] brother [[G80]] John. [[G2491]] They [[G846]] [were] in [[G1722]] a [[G3588]] boat, [[G4143]] mending [[G2675]] [their] [[G3588]] nets. [[G1350]]

###### 20
Immediately [[G2112]] [Jesus] called [[G2564]] them, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] leaving [[G863]] their [[G846]] father [[G3962]] Zebedee [[G2199]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] boat [[G4143]] with [[G3326]] the [[G3588]] hired men, [[G3411]] they followed [[G565]] Him. [[G846]]

###### 21
Then [[G2532]] [Jesus and His companions] went [[G1531]] to [[G1519]] Capernaum, [[G2584]] and [[G2532]] as soon as [[G2112]] the [[G3588]] Sabbath [began], [[G4521]] [Jesus] entered [[G1525]] the [[G3588]] synagogue [[G4864]] [and] began to teach. [[G1321]]

###### 22
[The people] were astonished [[G1605]] at [[G1909]] His [[G846]] teaching, [[G1322]] because [[G1063]] He taught [[G1321]] as [[G5613]] one who had [[G2192]] authority, [[G1849]] and [[G2532]] not [[G3756]] as [[G5613]] the [[G3588]] scribes. [[G1122]]

###### 23
Suddenly [[G2112]] a man [[G444]] with [[G1722]] an unclean [[G169]] spirit [[G4151]] cried out [[G349]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] synagogue: [[G4864]]

###### 24
“What [[G5101]] do You [ want ] [[G4771]] with us, [[G1473]] Jesus [[G2424]] of Nazareth? [[G3479]] Have You come [[G2064]] to destroy [[G622]] us? [[G1473]] I know [[G1492]] who [[G5101]] You [[G4771]] are— [[G1510]] the [[G3588]] Holy [One] [[G40]] of God!” [[G2316]]

###### 25
But [[G2532]] Jesus [[G2424]] rebuked [[G2008]] [the spirit] [[G846]] [and] said, [[G3004]] “Be silent! [[G5392]] Come [[G1831]] out of [[G1537]] him!” [[G846]]

###### 26
At this, [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] unclean [[G169]] spirit [[G4151]] threw [the man] into convulsions [[G4682]] [and] came [[G1831]] out [[G1537]] with a loud shriek. [[G5456]]

###### 27
All [the people] [[G537]] were amazed [[G2284]] [and] [[G5620]] began to ask [[G4802]] one another, [[G1438]] “What [[G5101]] is [[G1510]] this? [[G3778]] A new [[G2537]] teaching [[G1322]] with [[G2596]] authority! [[G1849]] He commands [[G2004]] even [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] unclean [[G169]] spirits, [[G4151]] and [[G2532]] they obey [[G5219]] Him!” [[G846]]

###### 28
And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] news [[G189]] about [Jesus] [[G846]] spread [[G1831]] quickly [[G2112]] through [[G3837]] the [[G3588]] whole [[G3650]] region [[G4066]] of Galilee. [[G1056]]

###### 29
As soon as [[G2532]] [Jesus and His companions] had left [[G1831]] the [[G3588]] synagogue, [[G4864]] they went [[G2064]] with [[G3326]] James [[G2385]] and [[G2532]] John [[G2491]] to [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] home [[G3614]] of Simon [[G4613]] and [[G2532]] Andrew. [[G406]]

###### 30
Simon’s [[G4613]] mother-in-law [[G3994]] was sick in bed [[G2621]] with a fever, [[G4445]] and [[G2532]] they promptly told [[G3004]] [Jesus] [[G846]] about [[G4012]] her. [[G846]]

###### 31
So [[G2532]] He went to [her], [[G4334]] took [[G2902]] her [[G3588]] [by the] hand, [[G5495]] and helped her up. [[G1453]] The [[G3588]] fever [[G4446]] left [[G863]] her, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] she began to serve [[G1247]] them. [[G846]]

###### 32
That evening, [[G3798]] after [[G3753]] sunset, [[G2246]] [people] brought [[G5342]] to [[G4314]] Him [[G846]] all [[G3956]] who [[G3588]] were [[G2192]] sick [[G2560]] and [[G2532]] demon-possessed, [[G1139]]

###### 33
and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] whole [[G3650]] town [[G4172]] gathered [[G1996]] at [[G4314]] the [[G3588]] door. [[G2374]]

###### 34
And [[G2532]] [Jesus] healed [[G2323]] many [[G4183]] who were [[G2192]] ill [[G2560]] with various [[G4164]] diseases [[G3554]] and [[G2532]] drove out [[G1544]] many [[G4183]] demons. [[G1140]] But [[G2532]] He would not allow [[G863]] the [[G3588]] demons [[G1140]] to speak, [[G2980]] because [[G3754]] they knew [[G1492]] who He was. [[G846]]

###### 35
Early in the morning, [[G4404]] while it was [[G3029]] still dark, [[G1773]] [Jesus] got up [[G450]] [and] slipped out [[G1831]] to [[G1519]] a solitary [[G2048]] place [[G5117]] to pray. [[G4336]]

###### 36
Simon [[G4613]] and [[G2532]] his companions [[G3588]] went to look for [[G2614]] Him, [[G846]]

###### 37
and [[G2532]] when they found [[G2147]] Him, [[G846]] they said, [[G3004]] “Everyone [[G3956]] is looking for [[G2212]] You!” [[G4771]]

###### 38
But [[G2532]] [Jesus] answered, [[G3004]] “Let us go [[G71]] on [[G237]] to [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] neighboring [[G2192]] towns [[G2969]] so [[G2443]] I can preach [[G2784]] there [[G1563]] as well, [[G2532]] for [[G1063]] that is why [[G1519]] I have come.” [[G1831]]

###### 39
[So] [[G2532]] He went [[G2064]] throughout [[G1519]] Galilee, [[G1056]] preaching [[G2784]] in [[G1519]] their [[G846]] synagogues [[G4864]] and [[G2532]] driving out [[G1544]] demons. [[G1140]]

###### 40
Then [[G2532]] a leper [[G3015]] came [[G2064]] to [[G4314]] [Jesus], [[G846]] begging [[G3870]] on his knees: [[G1120]] “If [[G1437]] You are willing, [[G2309]] You can [[G1410]] make me clean.” [[G2511]]

###### 41
Moved with compassion, [[G4697]] Jesus reached out [[G1614]] His [[G846]] hand [[G5495]] [and] touched [the man]. [[G680]] “I am willing,” [[G2309]] He said, [[G3004]] “Be clean.” [[G2511]]

###### 42
Immediately [[G2112]] the [[G3588]] leprosy [[G3014]] left [[G565]] him, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] he was cleansed. [[G2511]]

###### 43
[Jesus] promptly sent him away [[G1544]] with a stern warning: [[G1690]]

###### 44
“See [[G3708]] that you don’t tell [[G2036]] [anyone]. [[G3367]] But [[G235]] go, [[G5217]] show [[G1166]] yourself [[G4572]] to the [[G3588]] priest [[G2409]] and [[G2532]] present the offering [[G4374]] Moses [[G3475]] prescribed [[G4367]] for [[G4012]] your [[G4771]] cleansing, [[G2512]] as [[G1519]] a testimony [[G3142]] to them.” [[G846]]

###### 45
But [[G1161]] the [man] [[G3588]] went out [[G1831]] [and] openly [[G4183]] began [[G756]] to proclaim [[G2784]] and [[G2532]] spread [[G1310]] the [[G3588]] news. [[G3056]] Consequently, [[G5620]] Jesus [[G846]] could no longer [[G3371]] enter [[G1525]] a town [[G4172]] in plain view, [[G5320]] but [[G235]] He stayed [[G1510]] out [[G1854]] in [[G1909]] solitary [[G2048]] places. [[G5117]] Yet [[G2532]] [people] came [[G2064]] to [[G4314]] Him [[G846]] from every quarter. [[G3840]]
