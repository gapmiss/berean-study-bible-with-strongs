###### 1
On [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] other side [[G4008]] of the [[G3588]] sea, [[G2281]] they arrived [[G2064]] in [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] region [[G5561]] of the [[G3588]] Gerasenes. [[G1086]]

###### 2
As soon as [[G2532]] [Jesus] [[G846]] got [[G1831]] out of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] boat, [[G4143]] a man [[G444]] with [[G1722]] an unclean [[G169]] spirit [[G4151]] [came] from [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] tombs [[G3419]] [and] met [[G5221]] Him. [[G846]]

###### 3
[He] [[G3739]] had [[G2192]] been living [[G2731]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] tombs [[G3418]] and [[G2532]] could [[G1410]] no longer [[G3765]] be restrained, [[G1210]] [even] [[G3761]] with chains. [[G254]]

###### 4
[Though] [[G1223]] he [[G846]] {was} often [[G4178]] bound [[G1210]] with chains [[G254]] and [[G2532]] shackles, [[G3976]] he had broken [[G1288]] the [[G3588]] chains [[G254]] and [[G2532]] shattered [[G4937]] the [[G3588]] shackles. [[G3976]] Now [[G2532]] no one [[G3762]] had the strength [[G2480]] to subdue [[G1150]] him. [[G846]]

###### 5
Night [[G3571]] and [[G2532]] day [[G2250]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] tombs [[G3418]] and [[G2532]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] mountains, [[G3735]] he [[G1510]] kept [[G1223]] crying out [[G2896]] and [[G2532]] cutting [[G2629]] himself [[G1438]] with stones. [[G3037]]

###### 6
When [[G2532]] [the man] saw [[G3708]] Jesus [[G2424]] from [[G575]] a distance, [[G3113]] he ran [[G5143]] and [[G2532]] fell on his knees [[G4352]] before Him. [[G846]]

###### 7
And [[G2532]] he shouted [[G2896]] in a loud voice, [[G5456]] “What [[G5101]] do You [want] [[G4771]] with me, [[G1473]] Jesus, [[G2424]] Son [[G5207]] of [[G3588]] the [[G3588]] Most High [[G5310]] God? [[G2316]] I beg [[G3726]] You [[G4771]] before God [[G2316]] not [[G3361]] to torture [[G928]] me!” [[G1473]]

###### 8
For [[G1063]] [Jesus] had already declared, [[G2036]] “Come [[G1831]] out of [[G1537]] [this] [[G3588]] man, [[G444]] {you} unclean [[G169]] spirit!” [[G4151]]

###### 9
“What [is] [[G5101]] your [[G4771]] name?” [[G3686]] [Jesus] asked. [[G1905]] “My [[G1473]] name [is] [[G3686]] Legion,” [[G3003]] he replied, [[G846]] “for [[G3754]] we are [[G1510]] many.” [[G4183]]

###### 10
And [[G2532]] he begged [[G3870]] [Jesus] [[G846]] repeatedly [[G4183]] not to send [[G649]] them [[G846]] out of [[G1854]] [that] [[G3588]] region. [[G5561]]

###### 11
There [[G1563]] on the [[G3588]] nearby [[G4314]] hillside [[G3735]] a large [[G3173]] herd [[G34]] of pigs [[G5519]] was [[G1510]] feeding. [[G1006]]

###### 12
[So] [[G2532]] [the demons] begged [[G3870]] [Jesus], [[G846]] “Send [[G3992]] us [[G1473]] to [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] pigs, [[G5519]] so that [[G2443]] we may enter [[G1525]] them.” [[G846]]

###### 13
He gave them permission, [[G2010]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] unclean [[G169]] spirits [[G4151]] came out [[G1831]] [and] went [[G1525]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] pigs, [[G5519]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] herd [[G34]] of about [[G5613]] two thousand [[G1367]] rushed [[G3729]] down [[G2596]] the [[G3588]] steep bank [[G2911]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] sea [[G2281]] and [[G2532]] drowned [[G4155]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] [water]. [[G2281]]

###### 14
Those [[G3588]] tending [[G1006]] [the pigs] [[G846]] ran off [[G5343]] and [[G2532]] reported [this] [[G518]] in [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] town [[G4172]] and [[G2532]] countryside, [[G68]] and [[G2532]] [the people] went out [[G2064]] to see [[G3708]] what [[G5101]] had happened. [[G1096]]

###### 15
When [[G2532]] they came [[G2064]] to [[G4314]] Jesus, [[G2424]] they saw [[G2334]] the [man] who [[G3588]] had been possessed [[G1139]] by the [[G3588]] legion {of demons} [[G3003]] sitting [there], [[G2521]] clothed [[G2439]] and [[G2532]] in his right mind; [[G4993]] and [[G2532]] they were afraid. [[G5399]]

###### 16
Those [[G3588]] who had seen [it] [[G3708]] described [[G1334]] what [[G4459]] had happened [[G1096]] to the [[G3588]] demon-possessed man [[G1139]] and [[G2532]] [also to] [[G4012]] the [[G3588]] pigs. [[G5519]]

###### 17
And [[G2532]] [the people] began [[G756]] to plead with [[G3870]] [Jesus] [[G846]] to leave [[G565]] their [[G846]] region. [[G3725]]

###### 18
As [[G2532]] He [[G846]] was getting [[G1684]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] boat, [[G4143]] the [man] [[G3588]] who had been possessed by the demons [[G1139]] begged [[G3870]] to [[G2443]] go [[G1510]] with [[G3326]] Him. [[G846]]

###### 19
But [[G2532]] [Jesus] would not allow [[G863]] him. [[G846]] “Go [[G5217]] home [[G3624]] to [[G4314]] your own [people],” [[G4674]] He said, [[G3004]] “and [[G2532]] tell [[G518]] them [[G846]] how much [[G3745]] the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] has done [[G4160]] for you, [[G4771]] and [[G2532]] what mercy He has shown [[G1653]] you.” [[G4771]]

###### 20
[So] [[G2532]] [the man] went away [[G565]] and [[G2532]] began [[G756]] to proclaim [[G2784]] throughout [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] Decapolis [[G1179]] how much [[G3745]] Jesus [[G2424]] had done [[G4160]] for him. [[G846]] And [[G2532]] everyone [[G3956]] was amazed. [[G2296]]

###### 21
When [[G2532]] Jesus [[G2424]] had again crossed [[G1276]] by [[G1722]] boat [[G4143]] to [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] other side, [[G4008]] a large [[G4183]] crowd [[G3793]] gathered [[G4863]] around [[G1909]] Him [[G846]] beside [[G3844]] the [[G3588]] sea. [[G2281]]

###### 22
A [[G1520]] synagogue leader [[G752]] named [[G3686]] Jairus [[G2383]] arrived, [[G2064]] and [[G2532]] seeing [[G3708]] [Jesus], [[G846]] he fell [[G4098]] at [[G4314]] His [[G846]] feet [[G4228]]

###### 23
and [[G2532]] pleaded with [[G3870]] Him [[G846]] urgently, [[G4183]] “My [[G1473]] little daughter [[G2365]] is [[G2192]] near death. [[G2079]] [Please] [[G2443]] come [[G2064]] [and] place [[G2007]] [Your] [[G3588]] hands [[G5495]] on her, [[G846]] so that [[G2443]] she will be healed [[G4982]] and [[G2532]] live.” [[G2198]]

###### 24
So [[G2532]] [Jesus] went [[G565]] with [[G3326]] him, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] a large [[G4183]] crowd [[G3793]] followed [[G190]] and [[G2532]] pressed around [[G4918]] Him. [[G846]]

###### 25
And [[G2532]] a woman [[G1135]] was there [[G1510]] who had been afflicted [[G1722]] for twelve [[G1427]] years [[G2094]] by an issue [[G4511]] of bleeding. [[G129]]

###### 26
She had suffered [[G3958]] greatly [[G4183]] under the care of [[G5259]] many [[G4183]] physicians [[G2395]] and [[G2532]] had spent [[G1159]] all [[G3956]] she had, [[G846]] but [[G2532]] to no [[G3367]] avail. [[G5623]] Instead, [[G3123]] [her condition] had only grown [[G2064]] worse. [[G5501]]

###### 27
When [the woman] heard [[G191]] about [[G4012]] Jesus, [[G2424]] she came up [[G2064]] through [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] crowd [[G3793]] behind [Him] [[G3693]] [and] touched [[G680]] His [[G846]] cloak. [[G2440]]

###### 28
For [[G1063]] she kept saying, [[G2036]] “If [[G1437]] I only touch [[G680]] His [[G846]] clothes, [[G2440]] I will be healed.” [[G4982]]

###### 29
At that instant, [[G2112]] her [[G846]] bleeding [[G129]] stopped, [[G3583]] and [[G2532]] she sensed [[G1097]] in [her] [[G3588]] body [[G4983]] that [[G3754]] she was healed [[G2390]] of [[G575]] [her] [[G3588]] affliction. [[G3148]]

###### 30
At once [[G2112]] Jesus [[G2424]] was aware [[G1921]] [that] [[G3588]] power [[G1411]] had gone [[G1831]] out from [[G1537]] Him. [[G846]] Turning [[G1994]] to [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] crowd, [[G3793]] He asked, [[G2036]] “Who [[G5101]] touched [[G680]] My [[G1473]] clothes?” [[G2440]]

###### 31
His [[G846]] disciples [[G3101]] answered, [[G2036]] “You can see [[G991]] the [[G3588]] crowd [[G3793]] pressing in on [[G4918]] You, [[G4771]] and yet [[G2532]] You ask, [[G3004]] ‘Who [[G5101]] touched [[G680]] Me?’” [[G1473]]

###### 32
But [[G2532]] He kept looking around [[G4017]] to see [[G3708]] who [[G3588]] had done [[G4160]] this. [[G3778]]

###### 33
Then [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] woman, [[G1135]] knowing [[G1492]] what [[G3739]] had happened [[G1096]] to her, [[G846]] came [[G2064]] and [[G2532]] fell down before [[G4363]] Him [[G846]] trembling [[G5141]] in fear, [[G5399]] and [[G2532]] she told [[G2036]] Him [[G846]] the [[G3588]] whole [[G3956]] truth. [[G225]]

###### 34
“Daughter,” [[G2364]] said [Jesus], [[G2036]] “your [[G4771]] faith [[G4102]] has healed [[G4982]] you; [[G4771]] go [[G5217]] in [[G1519]] peace [[G1515]] and [[G2532]] be [[G1510]] free [[G5199]] of [[G575]] your [[G4771]] affliction.” [[G3148]]

###### 35
While He was still speaking, [[G2980]] [ messengers ] from [[G575]] [the house of Jairus] [[G752]] arrived [[G2064]] [and] said, [[G3004]] “Your [[G4771]] daughter [[G2364]] is dead; [[G599]] why [[G5101]] bother [[G4660]] the [[G3588]] Teacher [[G1320]] anymore?” [[G2089]]

###### 36
But [[G1161]] Jesus [[G2424]] overheard [[G3878]] their conversation [[G2980]] and said [[G3004]] to [[G3588]] [Jairus], [[G752]] “{Do} not [[G3361]] be afraid; [[G5399]] just [[G3440]] believe.” [[G4100]]

###### 37
And [[G2532]] He did not allow [[G863]] anyone [[G3762]] to accompany [[G4870]] Him [[G846]] except [[G1487]] Peter, [[G4074]] James, [[G2385]] and [[G2532]] John [[G2491]] the [[G3588]] brother [[G80]] of James. [[G2385]]

###### 38
When [[G2532]] they arrived [[G2064]] at [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] house [[G3624]] of [[G3588]] [Jairus], [[G752]] [Jesus] saw [[G2334]] [the] commotion [[G2351]] and [[G2532]] [the people] weeping [[G2799]] and [[G2532]] wailing [[G214]] loudly. [[G4183]]

###### 39
He went inside [[G1525]] [and] asked, [[G3004]] “Why [[G5101]] all this commotion [[G2350]] and [[G2532]] weeping? [[G2799]] The [[G3588]] child [[G3813]] is not dead, [[G599]] but [[G235]] asleep.” [[G2518]]

###### 40
And [[G2532]] they laughed at [[G2606]] Him. [[G846]] [After] [[G1161]] He [[G846]] had sent them all out, [[G1544]] He took [[G3880]] the [[G3588]] child’s [[G3813]] father [[G3962]] and [[G2532]] mother [[G3384]] and [[G2532]] His own companions, [[G3588]] and [[G2532]] went in [[G1531]] [to see] [[G3699]] the [[G3588]] child. [[G3813]]

###### 41
Taking [[G2902]] [her] [[G3813]] by the [[G3588]] hand, [[G5495]] [Jesus] said, [[G3004]] “Talitha [[G5008]] koum!” [[G2891]] which [[G3739]] means, [[G3177]] “Little girl, [[G2877]] I say [[G3004]] to you, [[G4771]] get up!” [[G1453]]

###### 42
Immediately [[G2112]] the [[G3588]] girl [[G2877]] got up [[G450]] and [[G2532]] began to walk around. [[G4043]] She was [[G1510]] twelve [[G1427]] years old, [[G2094]] and [[G2532]] at once [[G2112]] they were overcome [[G1839]] with astonishment. [[G1611]]

###### 43
Then [[G2532]] [Jesus] gave strict orders [[G1291]] that [[G2443]] no one [[G3367]] should know about [[G1097]] this, [[G3778]] and [[G2532]] He told [them] [[G2036]] to give [[G1325]] her [[G846]] [something] to eat. [[G5315]]
