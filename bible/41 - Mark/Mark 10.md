### 1
Then [[G2532]] Jesus left [[G450]] that place [[G1564]] [and] went [[G2064]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] region [[G3725]] of Judea, [[G2449]] beyond [[G4008]] the [[G3588]] Jordan. [[G2446]] Again [[G3825]] [the] crowds [[G3793]] came [[G4848]] to [[G4314]] Him [[G846]] and [[G2532]] He taught [[G1321]] them, [[G846]] as [[G5613]] was His custom. [[G1486]]

### 2
[Some] Pharisees [[G5330]] came [[G4334]] to test [[G3985]] Him. [[G846]] “Is it lawful [[G1832]] for a man [[G435]] to divorce [[G630]] his wife?” [[G1135]] they inquired. [[G1905]]

### 3
“What [[G5101]] {did} Moses [[G3475]] command [[G1781]] you?” [[G4771]] He replied. [[G611]]

### 4
They answered, [[G2036]] “Moses [[G3475]] permitted [[G2010]] [a man] to write [his wife] [[G1125]] a certificate [[G975]] of divorce [[G647]] and [[G2532]] send [her] away.” [[G630]]

### 5
But [[G1161]] Jesus [[G2424]] told [[G2036]] them, [[G846]] “[Moses] wrote [[G1125]] this [[G3778]] commandment [[G1785]] for you [[G4771]] because [[G4314]] your [[G4771]] hearts were hard. [[G4641]]

### 6
However, [[G1161]] from [[G575]] [the] beginning [[G746]] of creation, [[G2937]] ‘[God] made [[G4160]] them [[G846]] male [[G730]] and [[G2532]] female.’ [[G2338]]

### 7
‘For this reason [[G1752]] a man [[G444]] will leave [[G2641]] his [[G846]] father [[G3962]] and [[G2532]] mother [[G3384]] and [[G2532]] be united [[G4347]] to [[G4314]] his [[G846]] wife, [[G1135]]

### 8
and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] two [[G1417]] will become [[G1510]] one [[G1520]] flesh.’ [[G4561]] So [[G5620]] they are [[G1510]] no longer [[G3765]] two, [[G1417]] but [[G235]] one [[G1520]] flesh. [[G4561]]

### 9
Therefore [[G3767]] what [[G3739]] God [[G2316]] has joined together, [[G4801]] {let} man [[G444]] not [[G3361]] separate.” [[G5563]]

### 10
When [they were] [[G2532]] back [[G3825]] inside [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] house, [[G3614]] the [[G3588]] disciples [[G3101]] asked [[G1905]] [Jesus] [[G846]] about [[G4012]] this matter. [[G3778]]

### 11
[So] [[G2532]] He told [[G3004]] them, [[G846]] “Whoever [[G3739]] divorces [[G630]] his [[G846]] wife [[G1135]] and [[G2532]] marries [[G1060]] another [woman] [[G243]] commits adultery [[G3429]] against [[G1909]] her. [[G846]]

### 12
And [[G2532]] if [[G1437]] a woman [[G846]] divorces [[G630]] her [[G846]] husband [[G435]] [and] marries [[G1060]] another [man], [[G243]] she commits adultery.” [[G3429]]

### 13
[People] were bringing [[G4374]] [the] little children [[G3813]] to [Jesus] [[G846]] for [[G2443]] Him to place His hands [[G680]] on them. [[G846]] But [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] disciples [[G3101]] rebuked [[G2008]] [those who brought them]. [[G846]]

### 14
[When] Jesus [[G2424]] saw this, [[G3708]] He was indignant [[G23]] and [[G2532]] told [[G2036]] them, [[G846]] “Let [[G863]] the [[G3588]] little children [[G3813]] come [[G2064]] to [[G4314]] Me, [[G1473]] [and] {do} not [[G3361]] hinder [[G2967]] them! [[G846]] For [[G1063]] the [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] of God [[G2316]] belongs [[G1510]] to [[G3588]] such [as these]. [[G5108]]

### 15
Truly [[G281]] I tell [[G3004]] you, [[G4771]] whoever [[G3739]] does not receive [[G1209]] the [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] of God [[G2316]] like [[G5613]] a little child [[G3813]] will never enter [[G1525]] it.” [[G846]]

### 16
And [[G2532]] He took [the children] in His arms, [[G1723]] placed [[G5087]] [His] [[G3588]] hands [[G5495]] on [[G1909]] them, [[G846]] [and] blessed [[G2127]] them. [[G846]]

### 17
As [[G2532]] [Jesus] started [[G1607]] on [[G1519]] His [[G846]] way, [[G3598]] [a man] [[G1520]] ran up [[G4370]] and [[G2532]] knelt before [[G1120]] Him. [[G846]] “Good [[G18]] Teacher,” [[G1320]] he asked, [[G1905]] “what [[G5101]] must I do [[G4160]] to [[G2443]] inherit [[G2816]] eternal [[G166]] life?” [[G2222]]

### 18
“Why [[G5101]] do you call [[G3004]] Me [[G1473]] good?” [[G18]] Jesus [[G2424]] replied. [[G2036]] “No one [is] [[G3762]] good [[G18]] except [[G1487]] God [[G2316]] alone. [[G1520]]

### 19
You know [[G1492]] the [[G3588]] commandments: [[G1785]] ‘{Do} not [[G3361]] murder, [[G5407]] {do} not [[G3361]] commit adultery, [[G3431]] {do} not [[G3361]] steal, [[G2813]] {do} not [[G3361]] bear false witness, [[G5576]] {do} not [[G3361]] defraud, [[G650]] [and] honor [[G5091]] your [[G4771]] father [[G3962]] and [[G2532]] mother.’” [[G3384]]

### 20
“Teacher,” [[G1320]] he replied, [[G5346]] “I have kept [[G5442]] all [[G3956]] these [[G3778]] from [[G1537]] my [[G1473]] youth.” [[G3503]]

### 21
Jesus [[G2424]] looked at [[G1689]] him, [[G846]] loved [[G25]] him, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] said [[G2036]] to him, [[G846]] “[There is] one thing [[G1520]] you [[G4771]] lack: [[G5302]] Go, [[G5217]] sell [[G4453]] everything [[G3745]] you have [[G2192]] and [[G2532]] give [[G1325]] to the [[G3588]] poor, [[G4434]] and [[G2532]] you will have [[G2192]] treasure [[G2344]] in [[G1722]] heaven. [[G3772]] Then [[G2532]] come, [[G1204]] follow [[G190]] Me. [[G1473]]

### 22
But [[G1161]] [the man] was saddened [[G4768]] by [[G1909]] [these] [[G3588]] words [[G3056]] [and] went away [[G565]] in sorrow, [[G3076]] because [[G1063]] he had [[G1510]] great [[G4183]] wealth. [[G2933]]

### 23
Then [[G2532]] Jesus [[G2424]] looked around [[G4017]] [and] said to [[G3004]] His [[G846]] disciples, [[G3101]] “How [[G4459]] hard {it is} [[G1423]] for the [[G3588]] rich [[G5536]] to enter [[G1525]] the [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] of God!” [[G2316]]

### 24
And [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] disciples [[G3101]] were astonished [[G2284]] at [[G1909]] His [[G846]] words. [[G3056]] But [[G1161]] Jesus [[G2424]] said [[G3004]] to them [[G846]] again, [[G3825]] “Children, [[G5043]] how [[G4459]] hard [[G1422]] it is [[G1510]] to enter [[G1525]] the [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] of God! [[G2316]]

### 25
It is [[G1510]] easier [[G2123]] [for] a camel [[G2574]] to pass [[G1330]] through [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] eye [[G5168]] of a [[G3588]] needle [[G4476]] than [for] [[G2228]] a rich man [[G4145]] to enter [[G1525]] the [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] of God.” [[G2316]]

### 26
They were even more astonished [[G1605]] [and] said [[G3004]] to [[G4314]] one another, [[G1438]] “Who [[G5101]] then [[G2532]] can [[G1410]] be saved?” [[G4982]]

### 27
Jesus [[G2424]] looked at [[G1689]] them [[G846]] [and] said, [[G3004]] “With [[G3844]] man [[G444]] [this is] impossible, [[G102]] but [[G235]] not [[G3756]] with [[G3844]] God. [[G2316]] For [[G1063]] all things [[G3956]] [are] possible [[G1415]] with [[G3844]] God.” [[G2316]]

### 28
Peter [[G4074]] began [[G756]] to say [[G3004]] to Him, [[G846]] “Look, [[G2400]] we [[G1473]] have left [[G863]] everything [[G3956]] and [[G2532]] followed [[G190]] You.” [[G4771]]

### 29
“Truly [[G281]] I tell [[G3004]] you,” [[G4771]] said [[G5346]] Jesus, [[G2424]] “no one [[G3762]] who [[G3739]] has left [[G863]] home [[G3614]] or [[G2228]] brothers [[G80]] or [[G2228]] sisters [[G79]] or [[G2228]] mother [[G3384]] or [[G2228]] father [[G3962]] or [[G2228]] children [[G5043]] or [[G2228]] fields [[G68]] for My sake [[G1752]] and [[G2532]] for [[G1752]] the [[G3588]] gospel [[G2098]]

### 30
will fail to receive [[G2983]] a hundredfold [[G1542]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] present [[G3778]] age— [[G2540]] houses [[G3614]] and [[G2532]] brothers [[G80]] and [[G2532]] sisters [[G79]] and [[G2532]] mothers [[G3384]] and [[G2532]] children [[G5043]] and [[G2532]] fields, [[G68]] along with [[G3326]] persecutions— [[G1375]] and [[G2532]] [to receive] eternal [[G166]] life [[G2222]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] age [[G165]] to [[G3588]] come. [[G2064]]

### 31
But [[G1161]] many [who are] [[G4183]] first [[G4413]] will be [[G1510]] last, [[G2078]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] last [[G2078]] [will be] first.” [[G4413]]

### 32
[As] [[G1161]] they were [[G1510]] going up [[G305]] the [[G3588]] road [[G3598]] to [[G1519]] Jerusalem, [[G2414]] Jesus [[G2424]] was [[G1510]] walking ahead of [[G4254]] them. [[G846]] [The disciples] were filled with awe, [[G2284]] but [[G1161]] those who [[G3588]] followed [[G190]] were afraid. [[G5399]] Again [[G3825]] [Jesus] took [[G3880]] the [[G3588]] Twelve {aside} [[G1427]] [and] began [[G756]] to tell [[G3004]] them [[G846]] what [[G3588]] was going [[G3195]] to happen [[G4819]] to Him: [[G846]]

### 33
“Look, [[G2400]] we are going up [[G305]] to [[G1519]] Jerusalem, [[G2414]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of Man [[G444]] will be betrayed [[G3860]] to the [[G3588]] chief priests [[G749]] and [[G2532]] scribes. [[G1122]] They will condemn [[G2632]] Him [[G846]] to death [[G2288]] and [[G2532]] hand Him over [[G3860]] to the [[G3588]] Gentiles, [[G1484]]

### 34
[who] will mock [[G1702]] Him [[G846]] and [[G2532]] spit on [[G1716]] Him [[G846]] and [[G2532]] flog [Him] [[G3146]] and [[G2532]] kill [[G615]] Him. [[G846]] And [[G2532]] after [[G3326]] three [[G5140]] days [[G2250]] He will rise again.” [[G450]]

### 35
Then [[G2532]] James [[G2385]] and [[G2532]] John, [[G2491]] the [[G3588]] sons [[G5207]] of Zebedee, [[G2199]] came [[G4365]] to [Jesus] [[G846]] [and] declared, [[G3004]] “Teacher, [[G1320]] we want [[G2309]] You to do [[G4160]] for us [[G1473]] whatever [[G3739]] we ask.” [[G154]]

### 36
“What [[G5101]] is it you want [[G2309]] Me [[G1473]] to do [[G4160]] for you?” [[G4771]] He inquired. [[G2036]]

### 37
They answered, [[G2036]] “Grant [[G1325]] that [[G2443]] one [[G1520]] of [us] [[G4771]] may sit [[G2523]] at [[G1537]] Your right hand [[G1188]] and [[G2532]] [the other] [[G1520]] at [[G1537]] Your left [[G710]] in [[G1722]] Your [[G4771]] glory.” [[G1391]]

### 38
“You do not know [[G1492]] what [[G5101]] you are asking,” [[G154]] Jesus [[G2424]] replied. [[G2036]] “Can you [[G1410]] drink [[G4095]] the [[G3588]] cup [[G4221]] I [[G1473]] will drink, [[G4095]] [or] [[G2228]] be baptized [with] [[G907]] the [[G3588]] baptism [[G908]] [I will undergo]?” [[G907]]

### 39
“We can,” [[G1410]] they answered. [[G2036]] “You will drink [[G4095]] the [[G3588]] cup [[G4221]] that [[G3739]] I [[G1473]] drink,” [[G4095]] Jesus [[G2424]] said, [[G2036]] “and [[G2532]] you will be baptized [with] [[G907]] the [[G3588]] baptism [[G908]] [I undergo]. [[G907]]

### 40
But [[G1161]] to sit [[G2523]] at [[G1537]] My [[G1473]] right [[G1188]] or [[G2228]] [My] left [[G2176]] is [[G1510]] not [[G3756]] Mine [[G1699]] to grant. [[G1325]] [These places belong] to those for whom [[G3739]] they have been prepared.” [[G2090]]

### 41
On hearing [this], [[G191]] the [[G3588]] ten [[G1176]] became [[G756]] indignant [[G23]] with [[G4012]] James [[G2385]] and [[G2532]] John. [[G2491]]

### 42
So [[G2532]] Jesus [[G2424]] called them together [[G4341]] [and] said, [[G3004]] “You know [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] those [[G3588]] regarded as [[G1380]] rulers [[G757]] of the [[G3588]] Gentiles [[G1484]] exercise lordship over [[G2634]] them, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] their [[G846]] superiors [[G3173]] exercise authority over [[G2715]] them. [[G846]]

### 43
But [[G1161]] it shall not be [[G1510]] this way [[G3779]] among [[G1722]] you. [[G4771]] Instead, [[G235]] whoever [[G3739]] wants [[G2309]] to become [[G1096]] great [[G3173]] among [[G1722]] you [[G4771]] must be [[G1510]] your [[G4771]] servant, [[G1249]]

### 44
and [[G2532]] whoever [[G3739]] wants [[G2309]] to be [[G1510]] first [[G4413]] must be [[G1510]] [the] slave [[G1401]] of all. [[G3956]]

### 45
For [[G1063]] even [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of Man [[G444]] did not come [[G2064]] to be served, [[G1247]] but [[G235]] to serve, [[G1247]] and [[G2532]] to give [[G1325]] His [[G846]] life [[G5590]] [as] a ransom [[G3083]] for [[G473]] many.” [[G4183]]

### 46
Next, [[G2532]] they came [[G2064]] to [[G1519]] Jericho. [[G2410]] And [[G2532]] as [Jesus] [[G846]] and [[G2532]] His [[G846]] disciples [[G3101]] were leaving [[G1607]] Jericho [[G2410]] with [[G2532]] a large [[G2425]] crowd, [[G3793]] a blind [[G5185]] beggar [[G4319]] [named] Bartimaeus, [[G924]] the [[G3588]] son [[G5207]] of Timaeus, [[G5090]] was sitting [[G2521]] by [[G3844]] the [[G3588]] road. [[G3598]]

### 47
When [[G2532]] he heard [[G191]] that [[G3754]] it was [[G1510]] Jesus [[G2424]] of [[G3588]] Nazareth, [[G3479]] he began [[G756]] to cry out, [[G2896]] “Jesus, [[G2424]] Son [[G5207]] of David, [[G1138]] have mercy on [[G1653]] me!” [[G1473]]

### 48
Many [people] [[G4183]] admonished [[G2008]] him [[G846]] to [[G2443]] be silent, [[G4623]] but [[G1161]] he cried out [[G2896]] all [[G4183]] the louder, [[G3123]] “Son [[G5207]] of David, [[G1138]] have mercy on [[G1653]] me!” [[G1473]]

### 49
Jesus [[G2424]] stopped [[G2476]] [and] said, [[G2036]] “Call [[G5455]] him.” [[G846]] So [[G2532]] they called [[G5455]] the [[G3588]] blind [man]. [[G5185]] “Take courage!” [[G2293]] they said. [[G3004]] “Get up! [[G1453]] He is calling for [[G5455]] you.” [[G4771]]

### 50
Throwing off [[G577]] his [[G846]] cloak, [[G2440]] [Bartimaeus] jumped up [[G1530]] [and] came [[G2064]] to [[G4314]] Jesus. [[G2424]]

### 51
“What [[G5101]] do you want [[G2309]] Me to do [[G4160]] for you?” [[G4771]] Jesus [[G2424]] asked. [[G611]] “Rabboni,” [[G4462]] said [[G2036]] the [[G3588]] blind [man], [[G5185]] “I want to see again.” [[G308]]

### 52
“Go,” [[G5217]] said [[G2036]] Jesus, [[G2424]] “your [[G4771]] faith [[G4102]] has healed [[G4982]] you.” [[G4771]] And [[G2532]] immediately [[G2112]] he received his sight [[G308]] and [[G2532]] followed [[G190]] [Jesus] [[G846]] along [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] road. [[G3598]]
