###### 1
When [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] Sabbath [[G4521]] was over, [[G1230]] Mary [[G3137]] Magdalene, [[G3094]] Mary [[G3137]] the [mother] [[G3588]] of James, [[G2385]] and [[G2532]] Salome [[G4539]] bought [[G59]] spices [[G759]] so [[G2443]] they could go [[G2064]] [and] anoint [[G218]] [Jesus’ body]. [[G846]]

###### 2
Very [[G3029]] early [[G4404]] on the [[G3588]] first [day] [[G1520]] of the [[G3588]] week, [[G4521]] just after sunrise, [[G2246]] they went [[G2064]] to [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] tomb. [[G3419]]

###### 3
They were asking [[G2036]] one another, [[G1438]] “Who [[G5101]] will roll away [[G617]] the [[G3588]] stone [[G3037]] from [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] entrance [[G2374]] of the [[G3588]] tomb?” [[G3419]]

###### 4
But [[G2532]] when they looked up, [[G308]] they saw [[G2334]] that [[G3754]] the [[G3588]] stone [[G3037]] had been rolled away, [[G617]] even though [[G1063]] it was [[G1510]] extremely [[G4970]] large. [[G3173]]

###### 5
When [[G2532]] they entered [[G1525]] the [[G3588]] tomb, [[G3419]] they saw [[G3708]] a young man [[G3495]] dressed in [[G4016]] a white [[G3022]] robe [[G4749]] sitting [[G2521]] on [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] right side, [[G1188]] and [[G2532]] they were alarmed. [[G1568]]

###### 6
But [[G1161]] he said [[G3004]] to them, [[G846]] “{Do} not [[G3361]] be alarmed. [[G1568]] You are looking for [[G2212]] Jesus [[G2424]] the [[G3588]] Nazarene, [[G3479]] who [[G3588]] was crucified. [[G4717]] He has risen! [[G1453]] He is [[G1510]] not [[G3756]] here! [[G5602]] See [[G2400]] the [[G3588]] place [[G5117]] where [[G3699]] they laid [[G5087]] Him. [[G846]]

###### 7
But [[G235]] go, [[G5217]] tell [[G2036]] His [[G846]] disciples [[G3101]] and [[G2532]] Peter, [[G4074]] ‘He is going ahead of [[G4254]] you [[G4771]] into [[G1519]] Galilee. [[G1056]] There [[G1563]] you will see [[G3708]] Him, [[G846]] just as [[G2531]] He told [[G2036]] you.’” [[G4771]]

###### 8
So [[G2532]] they left [[G1831]] the [[G3588]] tomb [[G3419]] and ran away, [[G5343]] overwhelmed [[G2192]] with shock [[G5156]] and [[G2532]] amazement. [[G1611]] And [[G2532]] in their fear [[G5399]] they did not say [[G2036]] [a word to anyone]. [[G3762]]

###### 9
After [Jesus] had risen, [[G450]] early [[G4404]] [on the] first [day] [[G4413]] of the week, [[G4521]] He appeared [[G5316]] first [[G4412]] to Mary [[G3137]] Magdalene, [[G3094]] from [[G3844]] whom [[G3739]] He had driven out [[G1544]] seven [[G2033]] demons. [[G1140]]

###### 10
She [[G1565]] went [[G4198]] [and] told [[G518]] those [[G3588]] who had been [[G1096]] with [[G3326]] Him, [[G846]] who were [now] mourning [[G3996]] and [[G2532]] weeping. [[G2799]]

###### 11
And when they [[G2548]] heard [[G191]] that [[G3754]] [Jesus] was alive [[G2198]] and [[G2532]] she had seen Him, [[G2300]] they did not believe [it]. [[G569]]

###### 12
After [[G3326]] [this], [[G3778]] [Jesus] appeared [[G5319]] in [[G1722]] a different [[G2087]] form [[G3444]] to two [[G1417]] of [[G1537]] them [[G846]] as they walked [[G4043]] along [[G4198]] in [[G1519]] [the] country. [[G68]]

###### 13
And they [[G2548]] went back [[G565]] and reported [it] [[G518]] to the [[G3588]] rest, [[G3062]] but they did not believe [[G4100]] them [[G1565]] either. [[G3761]]

###### 14
Later [[G5305]] as they were eating, [[G345]] [Jesus] appeared [[G5319]] to the [[G3588]] eleven [[G1733]] and [[G2532]] rebuked them [[G3679]] for their [[G846]] unbelief [[G570]] and [[G2532]] hardness of heart, [[G4641]] because [[G3754]] they did not believe [[G4100]] those [[G3588]] who had seen [[G2300]] Him [[G846]] after He had risen. [[G1453]]

###### 15
And [[G2532]] He said [[G2036]] to them, [[G846]] “Go [[G4198]] into [[G1519]] all [[G537]] the [[G3588]] world [[G2889]] [and] preach [[G2784]] the [[G3588]] gospel [[G2098]] to every [[G3956]] creature. [[G2937]]

###### 16
Whoever [[G3588]] believes [[G4100]] and [[G2532]] is baptized [[G907]] will be saved, [[G4982]] but [[G1161]] whoever [[G3588]] does not believe [[G569]] will be condemned. [[G2632]]

###### 17
And [[G1161]] these [[G3778]] signs [[G4592]] will accompany [[G5023]] those [[G3588]] who believe: [[G4100]] In [[G1722]] My [[G1473]] name [[G3686]] they will drive out [[G1544]] demons; [[G1140]] they will speak [[G2980]] in new [[G2537]] tongues; [[G1100]]

###### 18
they will pick up [[G142]] snakes [[G3789]] with [[G1722]] their [[G3588]] hands, [[G5495]] and if [[G2579]] they drink [[G4095]] any [[G5100]] deadly poison, [[G2286]] it will not harm [[G984]] them; [[G846]] they will lay [[G2007]] [their] hands [[G5495]] on [[G1909]] [the] sick, [[G732]] and [[G2532]] they will be made [[G2192]] well.” [[G2573]]

###### 19
After [[G3326]] the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] Jesus [[G2424]] had spoken [[G2980]] to them, [[G846]] He was taken up [[G353]] into [[G1519]] heaven [[G3772]] and [[G2532]] sat down [[G2523]] at [[G1537]] [the] right hand [[G1188]] of God. [[G2316]]

###### 20
And [[G1161]] they [[G1565]] went out [[G1831]] [and] preached [[G2784]] everywhere, [[G3837]] [and] the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] worked through [them], [[G4903]] confirming [[G950]] [His] [[G3588]] word [[G3056]] by [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] signs [[G4592]] that accompanied [it]. [[G1872]]
