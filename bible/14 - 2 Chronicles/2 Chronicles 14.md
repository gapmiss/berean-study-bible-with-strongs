###### 1
Then Abijah [[H29]] rested [[H7901]] with [[H5973]] his fathers [[H1]] and was buried [[H6912]] in the City [[H5892]] of David. [[H1732]] And his son [[H1121]] Asa [[H609]] became king [[H4427]] in his place. [[H8478]] During his reign [[H3117]] the land [[H776]] was at peace [[H8252]] [for] ten [[H6235]] years. [[H8141]]

###### 2
And Asa [[H609]] did [[H6213]] what was good [[H2896]] and right [[H3477]] in the eyes [[H5869]] of the LORD [[H3068]] his God. [[H430]]

###### 3
He removed [[H5493]] the foreign [[H5236]] altars [[H4196]] and high places, [[H1116]] shattered [[H7665]] their sacred pillars, [[H4676]] and chopped down [[H1438]] the Asherah poles. [[H842]]

###### 4
He commanded [[H559]] the people of Judah [[H3063]] to seek [[H1875]] the LORD, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of their fathers, [[H1]] and to observe [[H6213]] the law [[H8451]] and the commandments. [[H4687]]

###### 5
He also removed [[H5493]] the high places [[H1116]] and the incense altars [[H2553]] from all [[H3605]] the cities [[H5892]] of Judah, [[H3063]] and under him [[H6440]] the kingdom [[H4467]] was at peace. [[H8252]]

###### 6
Because [[H3588]] the land [[H776]] was at peace, [[H8252]] Asa built [[H1129]] fortified [[H4694]] cities [[H5892]] in Judah. [[H3063]] In those [[H428]] days [[H8141]] no one [[H369]] made war [[H4421]] with him, [[H5973]] because [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] gave him rest. [[H5117]]

###### 7
So he said [[H559]] to the people of Judah, [[H3063]] “Let us build [[H1129]] these [[H428]] cities [[H5892]] and surround [[H5437]] them with walls [[H2346]] and towers, [[H4026]] with doors [[H1817]] and bars. [[H1280]] The land [[H776]] is still [[H5750]] ours [[H6440]] because [[H3588]] we have sought [[H1875]] the LORD [[H3068]] our God. [[H430]] We have sought [Him] [[H1875]] and He has given us rest [[H5117]] on  every side. [[H5439]] So they built [[H1129]] and prospered. [[H6743]]

###### 8
Asa [[H609]] had [[H1961]] an army [[H2428]] of 300,000 men [[H7969]] from Judah [[H3063]] bearing [[H5375]] large shields [[H6793]] and spears, [[H7420]] and 280,000 men [[H3967]] from Benjamin [[H1144]] bearing [[H5375]] small shields [[H4043]] and drawing [[H1869]] the bow. [[H7198]] All [[H3605]] these [were] [[H428]] mighty warriors. [[H1368]]

###### 9
Then Zerah [[H2226]] the Cushite [[H3569]] came [[H3318]] against them [[H413]] with an army [[H2428]] of 1,000,000 men [[H505]] [and] 300 [[H7969]] chariots, [[H4818]] and they advanced [[H935]] as far as [[H5704]] Mareshah. [[H4762]]

###### 10
So Asa [[H609]] marched out [[H3318]] against [[H6440]] him and lined up [[H6186]] in battle formation [[H4421]] in the Valley of Zephathah [[H1516]] near Mareshah. [[H4762]]

###### 11
Then Asa [[H609]] cried out [[H7121]] to [[H413]] the LORD [[H3068]] his God: [[H430]] “O LORD, [[H3068]] there is no one [[H369]] besides You [[H5973]] to help [[H5826]] the powerless [[H369]] against the mighty. [[H7227]] Help us, [[H5826]] O LORD [[H3068]] our God, [[H430]] for [[H3588]] we rely [[H8172]] on You, [[H5921]] and in Your name [[H8034]] we have come [[H935]] against [[H5921]] this [[H2088]] multitude. [[H1995]] O LORD, [[H3068]] You [[H859]] are our God. [[H430]] Do not [[H408]] let a mere mortal [[H582]] prevail [[H6113]] against You. [[H5973]]

###### 12
So the LORD [[H3069]] struck down [[H5062]] the Cushites [[H3569]] before [[H6440]] Asa [[H609]] and [[H6440]] Judah, [[H3063]] and the Cushites [[H3569]] fled. [[H5127]]

###### 13
Then Asa [[H609]] and his army [[H5971]] pursued them [[H7291]] as far as [[H5704]] Gerar. [[H1642]] The Cushites [[H3569]] fell [[H5307]] and could not [[H369]] recover, [[H4241]] for [[H3588]] they were crushed [[H7665]] before [[H6440]] the LORD [[H3068]] and His army. [[H4264]] So the people of Judah carried off [[H5375]] a great amount of [[H7235]] plunder [[H7998]]

###### 14
and attacked [[H5221]] all [[H3605]] the cities [[H5892]] around [[H5439]] Gerar, [[H1642]] because [[H3588]] the terror [[H6343]] of the LORD [[H3068]] had fallen [[H1961]] upon them. [[H5921]] They plundered [[H962]] all [[H3605]] the cities, [[H5892]] since [[H3588]] there was [[H1961]] much [[H7227]] plunder [[H961]] there. 

###### 15
They also [[H1571]] attacked [[H5221]] the tents [[H168]] of the herdsmen [[H4735]] and carried off [[H7617]] many [[H7230]] sheep [[H6629]] and camels. [[H1581]] Then they returned [[H7725]] to Jerusalem. [[H3389]]
