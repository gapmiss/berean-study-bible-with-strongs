### 1
Then Hezekiah [[H2396]] sent [[H7971]] word throughout [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] Israel [[H3478]] and Judah, [[H3063]] and he also [[H1571]] wrote [[H3789]] letters [[H107]] to [[H5921]] Ephraim [[H669]] and Manasseh [[H4519]] inviting them to come [[H935]] to the house [[H1004]] of the LORD [[H3068]] in Jerusalem [[H3389]] to keep [[H6213]] the Passover [[H6453]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

### 2
For the king [[H4428]] and his officials [[H8269]] and the whole [[H3605]] assembly [[H6951]] in Jerusalem [[H3389]] had decided [[H3289]] to keep [[H6213]] the Passover [[H6453]] in the second [[H8145]] month, [[H2320]]

### 3
since [[H3588]] they had been unable [[H3808]] to observe it [[H6213]] at the regular [[H1931]] time, [[H6256]] because not [[H3808]] enough [[H1767]] priests [[H3548]] had consecrated themselves [[H6942]] and the people [[H5971]] had not [[H3808]] been gathered [[H622]] in Jerusalem. [[H3389]]

### 4
The proposal [[H1697]] pleased [[H3474]] the king [[H4428]] and [[H5869]] all [[H3605]] the assembly. [[H6951]]

### 5
So they established [[H5975]] a decree [[H1697]] to circulate [[H5674]] a proclamation [[H6963]] throughout all [[H3605]] Israel, [[H3478]] from  Beersheba [[H884]] to [[H5704]] Dan, [[H1835]] that the people should come [[H935]] to keep [[H6213]] the Passover [[H6453]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] in Jerusalem. [[H3389]] For [[H3588]] they had not [[H3808]] observed it [[H6213]] as a nation [[H7230]] as prescribed. [[H3789]]

### 6
So the couriers [[H7323]] went [[H1980]] throughout [[H3605]] Israel [[H3478]] and Judah [[H3063]] with letters [[H107]] from [[H3027]] the king [[H4428]] and his officials, [[H8269]] which read: [[H559]] “Children [[H1121]] of Israel, [[H3478]] return [[H7725]] to [[H413]] the LORD, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of Abraham, [[H85]] Isaac, [[H3327]] and Israel, [[H3478]] so that He may return [[H7725]] to [[H413]] those of you who remain, [[H7604]] who have escaped [[H6413]] the grasp [[H3709]] of the kings [[H4428]] of Assyria. [[H804]]

### 7
Do not [[H408]] be [[H1961]] like your fathers [[H1]] and brothers [[H251]] who [[H834]] were unfaithful [[H4603]] to the LORD, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of their fathers, [[H1]] so that He made [[H5414]] them an object of horror, [[H8047]] as [[H834]] you [[H859]] can see. [[H7200]]

### 8
Now [[H6258]] do not [[H408]] stiffen [[H7185]] your neck [[H6203]] as your fathers [did]. [[H1]] Submit [[H5414]] to the LORD [[H3068]] and come [[H935]] to His sanctuary [[H4720]] which [[H834]] He has consecrated [[H6942]] forever. [[H5769]] Serve [[H5647]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God, [[H430]] so that His fierce anger [[H2740]] will turn away [[H7725]] from you. [[H4480]]

### 9
For [[H3588]] if you return [[H7725]] to [[H5921]] the LORD, [[H3068]] your brothers [[H251]] and sons [[H1121]] will receive mercy [[H7356]] in the presence [[H6440]] of their captors [[H7617]] and will return [[H7725]] to this [[H2063]] land. [[H776]] For [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] is gracious [[H2587]] and merciful; [[H7349]] He will not [[H3808]] turn His face [[H6440]] away [[H5493]] from you [[H4480]] if [[H518]] you return [[H7725]] to Him. [[H413]]

### 10
And [[H1961]] the couriers [[H7323]] traveled [[H5674]] from city [[H5892]] to city [[H5892]] through the land [[H776]] of Ephraim [[H669]] and Manasseh [[H4519]] as [[H5704]] far as Zebulun; [[H2074]] but the people scorned [[H7832]] and mocked [[H3932]] them. 

### 11
Nevertheless, [[H389]] some [[H582]] from Asher, [[H836]] Manasseh, [[H4519]] and Zebulun [[H2074]] humbled [[H3665]] themselves and came [[H935]] to Jerusalem. [[H3389]]

### 12
Also, [[H1571]] the power [[H3027]] of God [[H430]] was [[H1961]] on the people  in Judah [[H3063]] to give them [[H5414]] one [[H259]] heart [[H3820]] to obey [[H6213]] the command [[H4687]] of the king [[H4428]] and his officials [[H8269]] according to the word [[H1697]] of the LORD. [[H3068]]

### 13
In the second [[H8145]] month, [[H2320]] a very [[H3966]] great [[H7230]] assembly [[H6951]] gathered [[H622]] in Jerusalem [[H3389]] to celebrate [[H6213]] the Feast [[H2282]] of Unleavened Bread. [[H4682]]

### 14
They proceeded [[H6965]] to remove [[H5493]] the altars [[H4196]] in Jerusalem [[H3389]] and to take away [[H5493]] the incense altars [[H6999]] and throw [[H7993]] them into the Kidron [[H6939]] Valley. [[H5158]]

### 15
And on the fourteenth [[H702]] day of the second [[H8145]] month [[H2320]] they slaughtered [[H7819]] the Passover lamb. [[H6453]] The priests [[H3548]] and Levites [[H3881]] were ashamed, [[H3637]] and they consecrated themselves [[H6942]] and brought [[H935]] burnt offerings [[H5930]] to the house [[H1004]] of the LORD. [[H3068]]

### 16
They stood [[H5975]] at [[H5921]] their prescribed [[H4941]] posts, [[H5977]] according to the law [[H8451]] of Moses, [[H4872]] the man [[H376]] of God. [[H430]] The priests [[H3548]] sprinkled [[H2236]] the blood, [[H1818]] [which they received] from the hand [[H3027]] of the Levites. [[H3881]]

### 17
Since [[H3588]] there were many [[H7227]] in the assembly [[H6951]] who [[H834]] had not [[H3808]] consecrated themselves, [[H6942]] the Levites [[H3881]] were in charge of [[H5921]] slaughtering [[H7821]] the Passover [[H6453]] lambs for every [[H3605]] unclean person [[H3808]] to consecrate [the lambs] [[H6942]] to the LORD. [[H3068]]

### 18
A large number [[H4768]] of the people— [[H5971]] many [[H7227]] from Ephraim, [[H669]] Manasseh, [[H4519]] Issachar, [[H3485]] and Zebulun— [[H2074]] had not [[H3808]] purified themselves, [[H2891]] yet [[H3588]] they ate [[H398]] the Passover, [[H6453]] contrary [[H3808]] to what was written. [[H3789]] But [[H3588]] Hezekiah [[H2396]] interceded [[H6419]] for them, [[H5921]] saying, [[H559]] May the LORD, [[H3068]] who is good, [[H2896]] provide atonement for [[H3722]] everyone [[H1157]]

### 19
who [[H3605]] sets [[H3559]] his heart [[H3824]] on seeking [[H1875]] God— [[H430]] the LORD, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of his fathers— [[H1]] even if [he is] not [cleansed] [[H3808]] according to the purification [[H2893]] rules of the sanctuary.” [[H6944]]

### 20
And the LORD [[H3068]] heard [[H8085]] Hezekiah [[H2396]] and healed [[H7495]] the people. [[H5971]]

### 21
The Israelites [[H1121]] who were present [[H4672]] in Jerusalem [[H3389]] celebrated [[H6213]] the Feast [[H2282]] of Unleavened Bread [[H4682]] for seven [[H7651]] days [[H3117]] with great [[H1419]] joy, [[H8057]] and the Levites [[H3881]] and priests [[H3548]] praised [[H1984]] the LORD [[H3068]] day [[H3117]] after day [[H3117]] accompanied by loud [[H5797]] instruments [[H3627]] to the LORD. [[H3068]]

### 22
And Hezekiah [[H2396]] encouraged [[H1696]] all [[H3605]] the Levites [[H3881]] who performed skillfully [[H7919]] before the LORD. [[H3068]] For seven [[H7651]] days [[H3117]] they ate [[H398]] their assigned portion, [[H4150]] sacrificing [[H2076]] fellowship [[H8002]] offerings [[H2077]] and giving thanks [[H3034]] to the LORD, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of their fathers. [[H1]]

### 23
The whole [[H3605]] assembly [[H6951]] agreed [[H3289]] to observe [[H6213]] seven [[H7651]] more [[H312]] days, [[H3117]] so they observed [[H6213]] seven [[H7651]] days [[H3117]] with joy. [[H8057]]

### 24
For [[H3588]] Hezekiah [[H2396]] king [[H4428]] of Judah [[H3063]] contributed [[H7311]] a thousand [[H505]] bulls [[H6499]] and seven [[H7651]] thousand [[H505]] sheep [[H6629]] for the assembly, [[H6951]] and the officials [[H8269]] contributed [[H7311]] a thousand [[H505]] bulls [[H6499]] and ten [[H6235]] thousand [[H505]] sheep [[H6629]] for the assembly, [[H6951]] and a great number [[H7230]] priests [[H3548]] consecrated themselves. [[H6942]]

### 25
Then the whole [[H3605]] assembly [[H6951]] of Judah [[H3063]] rejoiced [[H8055]] along with the priests [[H3548]] and Levites [[H3881]] and all [[H3605]] the assembly [[H6951]] that had come [[H935]] from Israel, [[H3478]] including the foreigners [[H1616]] who had come [[H935]] from Israel [[H3478]] and those who lived [[H3427]] in Judah. [[H3063]]

### 26
So there was [[H1961]] great [[H1419]] rejoicing [[H8057]] in Jerusalem, [[H3389]] for [[H3588]] nothing [[H3808]] like this [had happened] [[H2063]] since the days [[H3117]] of Solomon [[H8010]] son [[H1121]] of David [[H1732]] king [[H4428]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

### 27
Then the priests [[H3548]] and the Levites [[H3881]] stood [[H6965]] to bless [[H1288]] the people, [[H5971]] and God heard [[H8085]] their voice, [[H6963]] and their prayer [[H8605]] came [[H935]] into His holy dwelling [[H4583]] place [[H6944]] in heaven. [[H8064]]
