[[2 Chronicles 4|←]] • [[2 Chronicles 6|→]]

###### 1
So all [[H3605]] the work [[H4399]] that [[H834]] Solomon [[H8010]] had performed [[H6213]] for the house [[H1004]] of the LORD [[H3068]] was completed. [[H7999]] Then Solomon [[H8010]] brought [[H935]] the consecrated items [[H6944]] of his father [[H1]] David— [[H1732]] the silver, [[H3701]] the gold, [[H2091]] and all [[H3605]] the furnishings— [[H3627]] and he placed them [[H5414]] in the treasuries [[H214]] of the house [[H1004]] of God. [[H430]]

###### 2
At that time [[H227]] Solomon [[H8010]] assembled [[H6950]] at [[H413]] Jerusalem [[H3389]] the elders [[H2205]] of Israel— [[H3478]] all [[H3605]] the tribal [[H4294]] heads [[H7218]] and family leaders [[H1]] of the Israelites— [[H1121]] to bring up [[H5927]] the ark [[H727]] of the covenant [[H1285]] of the LORD [[H3068]] from Zion, [[H6726]] the City [[H5892]] of David. [[H1732]]

###### 3
So all [[H3605]] the men [[H376]] of Israel [[H3478]] came together [[H6950]] to the king [[H4428]] at the feast [[H2282]] in the seventh [[H7637]] month. [[H2320]]

###### 4
When all [[H3605]] the elders [[H2205]] of Israel [[H3478]] had arrived, [[H935]] the Levites [[H3881]] took up [[H5375]] the ark, [[H727]]

###### 5
and they brought up [[H5927]] the ark [[H727]] and [[H853]] the Tent [[H168]] of Meeting [[H4150]] with [[H853]] all [[H3605]] [its] [[H168]] sacred [[H6944]] furnishings. [[H3627]] The Levitical [[H3881]] priests [[H3548]] carried them up. [[H5927]]

###### 6
There, before [[H6440]] the ark, [[H727]] King [[H4428]] Solomon [[H8010]] and all [[H3605]] the congregation [[H5712]] of Israel [[H3478]] who had assembled [[H3259]] with him [[H5921]] sacrificed [[H2076]] so many [[H7230]] sheep [[H6629]] and oxen [[H1241]] that [[H834]] they could not [[H3808]] be counted [[H5608]] or numbered. [[H4487]]

###### 7
Then the priests [[H3548]] brought [[H935]] the ark [[H727]] of the covenant [[H1285]] of the LORD [[H3068]] to [[H413]] its place [[H4725]] in [[H413]] the inner sanctuary [[H1687]] of the temple, [[H1004]] the Most Holy Place, [[H6944]] beneath [[H8478]] the wings [[H3671]] of the cherubim. [[H3742]]

###### 8
For [[H1961]] the cherubim [[H3742]] spread [[H6566]] their wings [[H3671]] over [[H5921]] the place [[H4725]] of the ark [[H727]] and overshadowed [[H3680]] the ark [[H727]] and [[H5921]] its poles. [[H905]]

###### 9
The poles [[H905]] were so long [[H748]] that their [[H905]] ends [[H7218]] could be seen [[H7200]] from [[H4480]] the Holy Place [[H727]] in [[H5921]] front [[H6440]] of the inner sanctuary, [[H1687]] but not [[H3808]] from outside [the Holy Place]; [[H2351]] and they are [[H1961]] there [[H8033]] to [[H5704]] this [[H2088]] day. [[H3117]]

###### 10
[There was] nothing [[H369]] in the ark [[H727]] except [[H7535]] the two [[H8147]] tablets [[H3871]] that [[H834]] Moses [[H4872]] had placed in it [[H5414]] at Horeb, [[H2722]] where [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] had made a covenant [[H3772]] with [[H5973]] the Israelites [[H1121]] after they had come out [[H3318]] of Egypt. [[H4714]]

###### 11
Now [[H3588]] all [[H3605]] the priests [[H3548]] who were present [[H4672]] had consecrated themselves [[H6942]] regardless of [[H369]] their divisions. [[H4256]] And when [[H1961]] the priests [[H3548]] came out [[H3318]] of [[H4480]] the Holy Place, [[H6944]]

###### 12
all [[H3605]] the Levitical [[H3881]] singers— [[H7891]] Asaph, [[H623]] Heman, [[H1968]] Jeduthun, [[H3038]] and their sons [[H1121]] and relatives— [[H251]] stood [[H5975]] on the east side [[H4217]] of the altar, [[H4196]] dressed [[H3847]] in fine linen [[H948]] and playing cymbals, [[H4700]] harps, [[H5035]] and lyres, [[H3658]] accompanied by [[H5973]] 120 [[H3967]] priests [[H3548]] sounding [[H2690]] trumpets. [[H2689]]

###### 13
The trumpeters [[H2690]] and singers [[H7891]] joined together [[H259]] to praise [[H1984]] and thank [[H3034]] the LORD [[H3068]] with one [[H259]] voice. [[H6963]] They raised [[H7311]] their voices, [[H6963]] accompanied by trumpets, [[H2689]] cymbals, [[H4700]] and musical [[H7892]] instruments, [[H3627]] in praise [[H1984]] to the LORD: [[H3068]] “For [[H3588]] He is good; [[H2896]] His loving devotion endures forever.” [[H2617]] Then the temple, [[H1004]] the house [[H1004]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] was filled [[H4390]] with a cloud [[H6051]]

###### 14
so that the priests [[H3548]] could [[H3808]] not [[H3201]] stand there [[H5975]] to minister [[H8334]] because [[H6440]] of the cloud; [[H6051]] for [[H3588]] the glory [[H3519]] of the LORD [[H3068]] filled [[H4390]] the house [[H1004]] of God. [[H430]]
