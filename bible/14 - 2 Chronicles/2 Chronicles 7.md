### 1
When Solomon [[H8010]] had finished [[H3615]] praying, [[H6419]] fire [[H784]] came down [[H3381]] from heaven [[H8064]] and consumed [[H398]] the burnt offering [[H5930]] and the sacrifices, [[H2077]] and the glory [[H3519]] of the LORD [[H3068]] filled [[H4390]] the temple. [[H1004]]

### 2
The priests [[H3548]] were not [[H3808]] able [[H3201]] to enter [[H935]] the house [[H1004]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] because [[H3588]] the glory [[H3519]] of the LORD [[H3068]] had filled [[H4390]] [it]. [[H1004]]

### 3
When all [[H3605]] the Israelites [[H1121]] saw [[H7200]] the fire [[H784]] coming down [[H3381]] and the glory [[H3519]] of the LORD [[H3068]] above [[H5921]] the temple, [[H1004]] they bowed down [[H3766]] on [[H5921]] the pavement [[H7531]] with their faces [[H639]] to the ground, [[H776]] and they worshiped [[H7812]] and gave thanks [[H3034]] to the LORD: [[H3068]] “For [[H3588]] He is good; [[H2896]] His loving devotion [[H2617]] endures forever. [[H5769]]

### 4
Then the king [[H4428]] and all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] offered [[H2076]] sacrifices [[H2077]] before [[H6440]] the LORD. [[H3068]]

### 5
And King [[H4428]] Solomon [[H8010]] offered [[H2076]] a sacrifice [[H2077]] of 22,000 [[H6242]] oxen [[H1241]] and 120,000 [[H3967]] sheep. [[H6629]] So the king [[H4428]] and all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] dedicated [[H2596]] the house [[H1004]] of God. [[H430]]

### 6
The priests [[H3548]] stood [[H5975]] at [[H5921]] their posts, [[H4931]] as did the Levites [[H3881]] with the musical [[H7892]] instruments [[H3627]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] which [[H834]] King [[H4428]] David [[H1732]] had made [[H6213]] for giving thanks [[H3034]] to the LORD [[H3068]] and with which David [[H1732]] had offered praise, saying, [[H1984]] “For [[H3588]] His loving devotion [[H2617]] endures forever.” [[H5769]] Across from the Levites, [[H5048]] the priests [[H3548]] sounded trumpets, [[H2690]] and all [[H3605]] the Israelites [[H3478]] were standing. [[H5975]]

### 7
Then Solomon [[H8010]] consecrated [[H6942]] the middle [[H8432]] of the courtyard [[H2691]] in front [[H6440]] of the house [[H1004]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] and [[H3588]] there [[H8033]] he offered [[H6213]] the burnt offerings [[H5930]] and the fat [[H2459]] of the peace offerings, [[H8002]] since [[H3588]] the bronze [[H5178]] altar [[H4196]] [he] [[H8010]] had made [[H6213]] could [[H3201]] not [[H3808]] contain [[H3557]] [all these offerings]. [[H4503]]

### 8
So at that [[H1931]] time [[H6256]] Solomon [[H8010]] and all [[H3605]] Israel [[H3478]] with him— [[H5973]] a very [[H3966]] great [[H1419]] assembly of people [[H6951]] from Lebo-hamath [[H935]] to [[H5704]] the Brook [[H5158]] of Egypt— [[H4714]] observed [[H6213]] the feast [[H2282]] for seven [[H7651]] days. [[H3117]]

### 9
On the eighth [[H8066]] day [[H3117]] they held [[H6213]] a solemn assembly, [[H6116]] for [[H3588]] the dedication [[H2598]] of the altar [[H4196]] had lasted seven [[H7651]] days, [[H3117]] and the feast [[H2282]] seven [[H7651]] days more. [[H3117]]

### 10
On the twenty-third [[H6242]] day [[H3117]] of the seventh [[H7637]] month, [[H2320]] [Solomon] sent the people [[H5971]] away [[H7971]] to their homes, [[H168]] joyful [[H8056]] and glad [[H2896]] of heart [[H3820]] for [[H5921]] the good things [[H2896]] that [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] had done [[H6213]] for David, [[H1732]] for Solomon, [[H8010]] and for His people [[H5971]] Israel. [[H3478]]

### 11
When Solomon [[H8010]] had finished [[H3615]] the house [[H1004]] of the LORD [[H3068]] and [[H853]] the royal [[H4428]] palace, [[H1004]] successfully [[H6743]] carrying out [[H935]] all [[H3605]] that was in [[H5921]] [his] [[H8010]] heart [[H3820]] to do [[H6213]] for the house [[H1004]] of the LORD [[H3068]] and for his own palace, [[H1004]]

### 12
the LORD [[H3068]] appeared [[H7200]] to [[H413]] [him] [[H8010]] at night [[H3915]] and said [[H559]] to him:  “I have heard [[H8085]] your prayer [[H8605]] and have chosen [[H977]] this [[H2088]] place [[H4725]] for Myself  as a house [[H1004]] of sacrifice. [[H2077]]

### 13
If [[H2005]] I close [[H6113]] the sky [[H8064]] so there is [[H1961]] no [[H3808]] rain, [[H4306]] or if [[H2005]] I command [[H6680]] the locust [[H2284]] to devour [[H398]] the land, [[H776]] or if [[H518]] I send [[H7971]] a plague [[H1698]] among My people, [[H5971]]

### 14
and My people [[H5971]] who [[H834]] are called [[H7121]] by [[H5921]] My name [[H8034]] humble themselves [[H3665]] and pray [[H6419]] and seek [[H1245]] My face, [[H6440]] and turn [[H7725]] from [[H4480]] their wicked [[H7451]] ways, [[H1870]] then I [[H589]] will hear [[H8085]] from heaven, [[H8064]] forgive [[H5545]] their sin, [[H2403]] and heal [[H7495]] their land. [[H776]]

### 15
Now [[H6258]] My eyes [[H5869]] will be [[H1961]] open [[H6605]] and My ears [[H241]] attentive [[H7183]] to the prayers offered [[H8605]] in this [[H2088]] place. [[H4725]]

### 16
For I have now chosen [[H977]] and consecrated [[H6942]] this [[H2088]] house [[H1004]] so that My Name [[H8034]] may be [[H1961]] there [[H8033]] forever. [[H5704]] My eyes [[H5869]] and My heart [[H3820]] will be [[H1961]] there [[H8033]] for all time. [[H3605]]

### 17
And as for you, [[H859]] if [[H518]] you walk [[H1980]] before [[H6440]] Me as [[H834]] your father [[H1]] David [[H1732]] walked, [[H1980]] doing [[H6213]] all [[H3605]] I have commanded you, [[H6680]] and if you keep [[H8104]] My statutes [[H2706]] and ordinances, [[H4941]]

### 18
then I will establish [[H6965]] your royal [[H4438]] throne, [[H3678]] as [[H834]] I covenanted [[H3772]] with your father [[H1]] David [[H1732]] when I said, [[H559]] ‘You will never [[H3808]] fail [[H3772]] to have a man [[H376]] to rule [[H4910]] over Israel.’ [[H3478]]

### 19
But if [[H518]] you [[H859]] turn away [[H7725]] and forsake [[H5800]] the statutes [[H2708]] and the commandments [[H4687]] I have set [[H5414]] before you, [[H6440]] and if you go off [[H1980]] to serve [[H5647]] and worship [[H7812]] other [[H312]] gods, [[H430]]

### 20
then I will uproot Israel [[H5428]] from [[H5921]] the soil [[H127]] I have given [[H5414]] them,  and this [[H2088]] temple [[H1004]] that [[H834]] I have sanctified [[H6942]] for My Name [[H8034]] I will banish [[H7993]] from [[H5921]] My presence. [[H6440]] I will make it [[H5414]] an object of scorn [[H4912]] and ridicule [[H8148]] among all [[H3605]] the peoples. [[H5971]]

### 21
And this [[H2088]] temple [[H1004]] will now [[H1961]] become a heap of rubble. [[H5945]] All [[H3605]] who pass [[H5674]] it by [[H5921]] will be appalled [[H8074]] and say, [[H559]] ‘Why [[H4100]] has the LORD [[H3068]] done [[H6213]] such a thing [[H3602]] to this [[H2063]] land [[H776]] and to this [[H2088]] temple?’ [[H1004]]

### 22
And [others] will answer, [[H559]] ‘Because [[H5921]] they have forsaken [[H5800]] the LORD, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of their fathers, [[H1]] who [[H834]] brought them out [[H3318]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] and have embraced [[H2388]] other [[H312]] gods, [[H430]] worshiping [[H7812]] and serving them. [[H5647]] Because of [[H5921]] this, [[H3651]] He has brought [[H935]] all [[H3605]] this [[H2063]] disaster [[H7451]] upon them. [[H5921]]
