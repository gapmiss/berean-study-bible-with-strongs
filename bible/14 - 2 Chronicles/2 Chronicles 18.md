###### 1
Now Jehoshaphat [[H3092]] had [[H1961]] riches [[H6239]] and honor [[H3519]] in abundance, [[H7230]] and he allied himself with Ahab [[H256]] by marriage. [[H2859]]

###### 2
And some years [[H8141]] later [[H7093]] he went down [[H3381]] to [[H413]] visit Ahab [[H256]] in Samaria, [[H8111]] where Ahab [[H256]] sacrificed [[H2076]] many [[H7230]] sheep [[H6629]] and cattle [[H1241]] for him  and the people [[H5971]] with him, [[H5973]] and urged him [[H5496]] to march up [[H5927]] to [[H413]] Ramoth-gilead. [[H7433]]

###### 3
Ahab [[H256]] king [[H4428]] of Israel [[H3478]] asked [[H559]] Jehoshaphat [[H3092]] king [[H4428]] of Judah, [[H3063]] “Will you go [[H1980]] with me [[H5973]] against Ramoth-gilead?” [[H7433]] And Jehoshaphat replied, [[H559]] “I [am] [[H3644]] as you [are], [[H3644]] and my people [[H5971]] as your people; [[H5971]] [we will join] you [[H5973]] in the war.” [[H4421]]

###### 4
But Jehoshaphat [[H3092]] also said [[H559]] to [[H413]] the king [[H4428]] of Israel, [[H3478]] “Please [[H4994]] inquire [[H1875]] first [[H3117]] for the word [[H1697]] of the LORD.” [[H3068]]

###### 5
So the king [[H4428]] of Israel [[H3478]] assembled [[H6908]] the prophets, [[H5030]] four [[H702]] hundred [[H3967]] men, [[H376]] and asked them, [[H559]] “Should we go [[H1980]] to war [[H4421]] against [[H413]] Ramoth-gilead, [[H7433]] or [[H518]] should we refrain?” [[H2308]] “Go up,” [[H5927]] they replied, [[H559]] “and God [[H430]] will deliver it [[H5414]] into the hand [[H3027]] of the king.” [[H4428]]

###### 6
But Jehoshaphat [[H3092]] asked, [[H559]] “Is there not [[H369]] still [[H5750]] a prophet [[H5030]] of the LORD [[H3068]] here [[H6311]] of whom we can inquire?” [[H853]]

###### 7
The king [[H4428]] of Israel [[H3478]] answered, [[H559]] “There is still [[H5750]] one [[H259]] man [[H376]] who can ask [[H1875]] the LORD, [[H3069]] but I [[H589]] hate him [[H8130]] because [[H3588]] he never [[H369]] prophesies [[H5012]] anything good [[H2896]] for me, [[H5921]] but only [[H3588]] bad. [[H7451]] He [[H1931]] is Micaiah [[H4321]] son [[H1121]] of Imlah. [[H3229]] “The king [[H4428]] should not [[H408]] say [[H559]] that! [[H3651]] Jehoshaphat [[H3092]] replied. [[H559]]

###### 8
So the king [[H4428]] of Israel [[H3478]] called [[H7121]] one [[H259]] of his officials [[H5631]] and said, [[H559]] “Bring [[H4116]] Micaiah [[H4318]] the son [[H1121]] of Imlah {at once}.” [[H3229]]

###### 9
Dressed [[H3847]] in royal attire, [[H899]] the king [[H4428]] of Israel [[H3478]] and Jehoshaphat [[H3092]] king [[H4428]] of Judah [[H3063]] were sitting [[H3427]] on [[H5921]] their thrones [[H3678]] at the threshing floor [[H1637]] by the entrance [[H6607]] of the gate [[H8179]] of Samaria, [[H8111]] with all [[H3605]] the prophets [[H5030]] prophesying [[H5012]] before them. [[H6440]]

###### 10
Now Zedekiah [[H6667]] son [[H1121]] of Chenaanah [[H3668]] had made [[H6213]] for himself  iron [[H1270]] horns [[H7161]] and declared, [[H559]] “This is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] says: [[H559]] ‘With these [[H428]] you shall gore [[H5055]] the Arameans [[H758]] until [[H5704]] they are finished off.’” [[H3615]]

###### 11
And all [[H3605]] the prophets [[H5030]] were prophesying [[H5012]] the same, [[H3651]] saying, [[H559]] “Go up [[H5927]] to Ramoth-gilead [[H7433]] and prosper, [[H6743]] for the LORD [[H3068]] will deliver [it] [[H5414]] into the hand [[H3027]] of the king.” [[H4428]]

###### 12
Then the messenger [[H4397]] who [[H834]] had gone [[H1980]] to call [[H7121]] Micaiah [[H4321]] instructed him, [[H1696]] “Behold, [[H2009]] with one [[H6310]] accord [[H259]] the words [[H1697]] of the prophets [[H5030]] are favorable [[H2896]] to [[H413]] the king. [[H4428]] So please [[H4994]] let your words [[H1697]] be [[H1961]] like [[H259]] theirs, [[H1992]] and speak [[H1696]] favorably. [[H2896]]

###### 13
But Micaiah [[H4321]] said, [[H559]] “As surely as the LORD [[H3068]] lives, [[H2416]] I will speak [[H1696]] whatever [[H834]] my God [[H430]] tells me.” [[H559]]

###### 14
When Micaiah arrived, [[H935]] the king [[H4428]] asked [[H559]] him, [[H413]] “Micaiah, [[H4318]] should we go [[H1980]] to war [[H4421]] against [[H413]] Ramoth-gilead, [[H7433]] or [[H518]] should we refrain?” [[H2308]] “Go up [[H5927]] and triumph,” [[H6743]] Micaiah replied, [[H559]] “for they will be given [[H5414]] into your hand.” [[H3027]]

###### 15
But the king [[H4428]] said [[H559]] to him, [[H413]] “How many [[H5704]] times [[H6471]] must I [[H589]] make you swear [[H7650]] not [[H3808]] to tell [[H1696]] me anything but [[H7535]] the truth [[H571]] in the name [[H8034]] of the LORD?” [[H3068]]

###### 16
So Micaiah declared: [[H559]] “I saw [[H7200]] all [[H3605]] Israel [[H3478]] scattered [[H6327]] on [[H5921]] the hills [[H2022]] like sheep [[H6629]] without [[H369]] a shepherd. [[H7462]] And the LORD [[H3068]] said, [[H559]] ‘These [people] [[H428]] have no [[H3808]] master; [[H113]] let each one [[H376]] return [[H7725]] home [[H1004]] in peace.’” [[H7965]]

###### 17
Then the king [[H4428]] of Israel [[H3478]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Jehoshaphat, [[H3092]] “Did I not [[H3808]] tell [[H559]] you [[H413]] that he never [[H3808]] prophesies [[H5012]] good [[H2896]] for me, [[H5921]] but only [[H3588]] bad?” [[H7451]]

###### 18
Micaiah continued, [[H559]] “Therefore [[H3651]] hear [[H8085]] the word [[H1697]] of the LORD: [[H3068]] I saw [[H7200]] the LORD [[H3068]] sitting [[H3427]] on [[H5921]] His throne, [[H3678]] and all [[H3605]] the host [[H6635]] of heaven [[H8064]] standing [[H5975]] on His right [[H3225]] and on His left. [[H8040]]

###### 19
And the LORD [[H3068]] said, [[H559]] ‘Who [[H4310]] will entice [[H6601]] Ahab [[H256]] king [[H4428]] of Israel [[H3478]] to march up [[H5927]] and fall [[H5307]] at Ramoth-gilead?’ [[H7433]] And one [[H2088]] suggested [[H559]] this, [[H3602]] and another [[H2088]] that. [[H3602]]

###### 20
Then a spirit [[H7307]] came forward, [[H3318]] stood [[H5975]] before [[H6440]] the LORD, [[H3068]] and said, [[H559]] ‘I [[H589]] will entice him.’ [[H6601]] ‘By what means?’ [[H4100]] asked [[H559]] the LORD. [[H3068]]

###### 21
And he replied, [[H559]] ‘I will go out [[H3318]] and be [[H1961]] a lying [[H8267]] spirit [[H7307]] in the mouth [[H6310]] of all [[H3605]] his prophets.’ [[H5030]] ‘You will surely [[H6601]] entice him [[H1571]] and prevail,’ [[H3201]] said [the LORD]. [[H559]] ‘Go [[H3318]] and do [[H6213]] it.’ [[H3651]]

###### 22
So [[H6258]] you see, [[H2009]] the LORD [[H3068]] has put [[H5414]] a lying [[H8267]] spirit [[H7307]] in the mouths [[H6310]] of these [[H428]] prophets of yours, [[H5030]] and the LORD [[H3068]] has pronounced [[H1696]] disaster [[H7451]] against you.” [[H5921]]

###### 23
Then Zedekiah [[H6667]] son [[H1121]] of Chenaanah [[H3668]] went up, [[H5066]] struck [[H5221]] Micaiah [[H4321]] in [[H5921]] the face, [[H3895]] and demanded, [[H559]] “Which [[H335]] way [[H1870]] did the Spirit [[H7307]] of the LORD [go] [[H3068]] when He departed [[H5674]] from me [[H853]] to speak [[H1696]] to you?” [[H854]]

###### 24
Micaiah [[H4321]] replied, [[H559]] “You will soon see, [[H7200]] on that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] when [[H834]] you go [[H935]] [and] hide [[H2244]] in an inner [[H2315]] room.” [[H2315]]

###### 25
And the king [[H4428]] of Israel [[H3478]] declared, [[H559]] “Take [[H3947]] Micaiah [[H4321]] and return [[H7725]] him to [[H413]] Amon [[H526]] the governor [[H8269]] of the city [[H5892]] and to [[H413]] Joash [[H3101]] the king’s [[H4428]] son, [[H1121]]

###### 26
and tell them [[H559]] that this is what [[H3541]] the king [[H4428]] says: [[H559]] ‘Put [[H7760]] this [man] [[H2088]] in prison [[H1004]] and feed him [[H398]] only bread [[H3899]] and water [[H4325]] until [[H5704]] I return [[H7725]] safely.’” [[H7965]]

###### 27
But Micaiah [[H4321]] replied, [[H559]] “If [[H518]] you ever return [[H7725]] safely, [[H7965]] the LORD [[H3068]] has not [[H3808]] spoken through me.” [[H1696]] Then he added, [[H559]] “Take heed, [[H8085]] all [[H3605]] you people!” [[H5971]]

###### 28
So the king [[H4428]] of Israel [[H3478]] and Jehoshaphat [[H3092]] king [[H4428]] of Judah [[H3063]] went up [[H5927]] to [[H413]] Ramoth-gilead. [[H7433]]

###### 29
And the king [[H4428]] of Israel [[H3478]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Jehoshaphat, [[H3092]] “I will disguise [[H2664]] myself and go [[H935]] into battle, [[H4421]] but you [[H859]] wear [[H3847]] your royal robes.” [[H899]] So the king [[H4428]] of Israel [[H3478]] disguised himself [[H2664]] and went [[H935]] into battle. [[H4421]]

###### 30
Now the king [[H4428]] of Aram [[H758]] had ordered [[H6680]] his chariot [[H7393]] commanders, [[H8269]] “Do not [[H3808]] fight [[H3898]] with anyone, [[H854]] small [[H6996]] or great, [[H1419]] except [[H3588]] the king [[H4428]] of Israel.” [[H3478]]

###### 31
When the chariot [[H7393]] commanders [[H8269]] saw [[H7200]] Jehoshaphat, [[H3092]] they [[H1992]] said, [[H559]] “This [[H1931]] is the king [[H4428]] of Israel!” [[H3478]] So they turned [[H5437]] to fight [[H5921]] against him, [[H3898]] but Jehoshaphat [[H3092]] cried out, [[H2199]] and the LORD [[H3068]] helped him. [[H5826]] God [[H430]] drew them away [[H5496]] from him. [[H4480]]

###### 32
And when the chariot [[H7393]] commanders [[H8269]] saw [[H7200]] that [[H3588]] he was [[H1961]] not [[H3808]] the king [[H4428]] of Israel, [[H3478]] they turned back [[H7725]] from pursuing him. [[H310]]

###### 33
However, a [certain] man [[H376]] drew [[H4900]] his bow [[H7198]] without taking special aim, [[H8537]] and he struck [[H5221]] the king [[H4428]] of Israel [[H3478]] between [[H996]] the joints [[H1694]] of his armor. [[H8302]] So [the king] said [[H559]] to his charioteer, [[H7395]] “Turn around [[H2015]] and take me out [[H3318]] of [[H4480]] the battle, [[H4264]] for [[H3588]] I am badly wounded!” [[H2470]]

###### 34
The battle [[H4421]] raged [[H5927]] throughout that [[H1931]] day, [[H3117]] and the king [[H4428]] of Israel [[H3478]] propped himself up [[H5975]] in his chariot [[H4818]] facing [[H5227]] the Arameans [[H758]] until [[H5704]] evening. [[H6153]] And at sunset [[H935]] he died. [[H4191]]
