Then Solomon [[H8010]] began [[H2490]] to build [[H1129]] the house [[H1004]] of the LORD [[H3069]] in Jerusalem [[H3389]] on Mount [[H2022]] Moriah, [[H4179]] where [the LORD] [[H834]] had appeared [[H7200]] to his father [[H1]] David. [[H1732]] [This was] the place that [[H4725]] David [[H1732]] had prepared [[H3559]] on the threshing floor [[H1637]] of Ornan [[H771]] the Jebusite. [[H2983]]

###### 2
[Solomon] began [[H2490]] construction [[H1129]] on the second [[H8145]] day of the second [[H8145]] month [[H2320]] in the fourth [[H702]] year [[H8141]] of his reign. [[H4438]]

###### 3
The foundation [[H3245]] that Solomon [[H8010]] laid [[H1129]] for the house [[H1004]] of God [[H430]] [was] sixty [[H8346]] cubits [[H520]] long [[H753]] and twenty [[H6242]] cubits [[H520]] wide, [[H7341]] according to the old [[H7223]] standard. [[H4060]]

###### 4
The portico [[H197]] at [[H5921]] the front, [[H6440]] extending across [[H5921]] the width [[H7341]] of the temple, [[H1004]] [was] twenty [[H6242]] cubits [long] [[H520]] [and] [[H3967]] twenty [cubits] [[H6242]] high. [[H1363]] He overlaid [[H6823]] the inside [[H6441]] with pure [[H2889]] gold. [[H2091]]

###### 5
He paneled [[H2645]] the main [[H1419]] room [[H1004]] with [[H6086]] cypress, [[H1265]] which he overlaid [[H2645]] with fine [[H2896]] gold [[H2091]] and decorated [[H5927]] with palm tree [[H8561]] and chain [designs]. [[H8333]]

###### 6
He adorned [[H6823]] the temple [[H1004]] with precious [[H3368]] stones [[H68]] for beauty, [[H8597]] and its gold [[H2091]] [was] [[H2091]] from Parvaim. [[H6516]]

###### 7
He overlaid [[H2645]] [its] [[H1004]] beams, [[H6982]] thresholds, [[H5592]] walls, [[H7023]] and doors [[H1817]] with gold, [[H2091]] and he carved [[H6605]] cherubim [[H3742]] on [[H5921]] the walls. [[H7023]]

###### 8
Then he made [[H6213]] the Most Holy [[H6944]] Place; [[H1004]] its length [[H753]] corresponded to [[H5921]] the width [[H7341]] of the temple, [[H1004]] twenty [[H6242]] cubits [long] [[H520]] and twenty [[H6242]] cubits [[H520]] wide, [[H7341]] and he overlaid [the inside] [[H2645]] with six [[H8337]] hundred [[H3967]] talents [[H3603]] of fine [[H2896]] gold. [[H2091]]

###### 9
The weight [[H4948]] of the nails [[H4548]] was fifty [[H2572]] shekels [[H8255]] of gold. [[H2091]] He also overlaid [[H2645]] the upper area [[H5944]] with gold. [[H2091]]

###### 10
In the Most Holy [[H6944]] Place [[H1004]] he made [[H6213]] two [[H8147]] cherubim [[H3742]] of sculptured [[H6816]] work, [[H4639]] and he overlaid [[H6823]] them with gold. [[H2091]]

###### 11
The total [[H753]] wingspan [[H3671]] of the cherubim [[H3742]] [was] twenty [[H6242]] cubits. [[H520]] One wing [[H3671]] of the first [cherub] [[H259]] [was] five [[H2568]] cubits [long] [[H520]] and touched [[H5060]] the wall [[H7023]] of the temple, [[H1004]] and [its] other [[H312]] wing [[H3671]] [was] five [[H2568]] cubits [long] [[H520]] and touched [[H5060]] the wing [[H3671]] of the other [[H312]] cherub. [[H3742]]

###### 12
The wing [[H3671]] of the second [[H259]] cherub [[H3742]] [also measured] five [[H2568]] cubits [[H520]] and touched [[H5060]] the wall [[H7023]] of the house, [[H1004]] while [its] other [[H312]] wing [[H3671]] [measured] five [[H2568]] cubits [[H520]] and touched [[H1695]] the wing [[H3671]] of the first [[H312]] cherub. [[H3742]]

###### 13
So the total wingspan [[H3671]] of these [[H428]] cherubim [[H3742]] [was] twenty [[H6242]] cubits. [[H520]] They [[H1992]] stood [[H5975]] on [[H5921]] their feet, [[H7272]] facing [[H6440]] the [main] room. [[H1004]]

###### 14
He made [[H6213]] the veil [[H6532]] of blue, [[H8504]] purple, [[H713]] and crimson yarn [[H3758]] and fine linen, [[H948]] with cherubim [[H3742]] woven [[H5927]] into it. [[H5921]]

###### 15
In front [[H6440]] of the temple [[H1004]] he made [[H6213]] two [[H8147]] pillars, [[H5982]] which [together] were thirty-five [[H7970]] cubits [[H520]] high, [[H753]] each with a capital [[H6858]] on [[H5921]] top [[H7218]] [measuring] five [[H2568]] cubits. [[H520]]

###### 16
He made [[H6213]] interwoven [[H1687]] chains [[H8333]] and put them [[H5414]] on [[H5921]] top [[H7218]] of the pillars. [[H5982]] He made [[H6213]] a hundred [[H3967]] pomegranates [[H7416]] and fastened them [[H5414]] into the chainwork. [[H8333]]

###### 17
Then he set up [[H6965]] the pillars [[H5982]] in [[H5921]] front [[H6440]] of the temple, [[H1964]] one [[H259]] on the south [[H3225]] and one [[H259]] on the north. [[H8040]] [The pillar] on the south [[H3227]] he named [[H7121]] Jachin, [[H3199]] and the [pillar] on the north [[H8042]] he named [[H8034]] Boaz. [[H1162]]
