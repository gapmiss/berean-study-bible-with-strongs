###### 1
Asa's son [[H1121]] Jehoshaphat [[H3092]] became king [[H4427]] in his place, [[H8478]] and he strengthened himself [[H2388]] against [[H5921]] Israel. [[H3478]]

###### 2
He stationed [[H5414]] troops [[H2428]] in every [[H3605]] fortified [[H1219]] city [[H5892]] of Judah [[H3063]] and put [[H5414]] garrisons [[H5333]] in the land [[H776]] of Judah [[H3063]] and in the cities [[H5892]] of Ephraim [[H669]] that [[H834]] his father [[H1]] Asa [[H609]] had captured. [[H3920]]

###### 3
Now the LORD [[H3068]] was [[H1961]] with [[H5973]] Jehoshaphat [[H3092]] because [[H3588]] he walked [[H1980]] in the earlier [[H7223]] ways [[H1870]] of his father [[H1]] David. [[H1732]] He did not [[H3808]] seek out [[H1875]] the Baals, [[H1168]]

###### 4
but [[H3588]] he sought [[H1875]] the God [[H430]] of his father [[H1]] and walked [[H1980]] by His commandments [[H4687]] rather than [[H3808]] the practices [[H4639]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

###### 5
So the LORD [[H3068]] established [[H3559]] the kingdom [[H4467]] in his hand, [[H3027]] and all [[H3605]] Judah [[H3063]] brought [[H5414]] him [[H3092]] tribute, [[H4503]] so that he had [[H1961]] an abundance [[H7230]] of riches [[H6239]] and honor. [[H3519]]

###### 7
In the third [[H7969]] year [[H8141]] of his reign, [[H4427]] Jehoshaphat sent [[H7971]] his officials [[H8269]] Ben-hail, [[H1134]] Obadiah, [[H5662]] Zechariah, [[H2148]] Nethanel, [[H5417]] and Micaiah [[H4322]] to teach [[H3925]] in the cities [[H5892]] of Judah, [[H3063]]

###### 9
They taught [[H3925]] throughout Judah, [[H3063]] taking with them [[H5973]] the Book [[H5612]] of the Law [[H8451]] of the LORD. [[H3068]] They went [[H5437]] throughout [[H3605]] the towns [[H5892]] of Judah [[H3063]] and taught [[H3925]] the people. [[H5971]]

###### 10

###### 11
