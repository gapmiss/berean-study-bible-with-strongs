###### 1
Now Solomon [[H8010]] son [[H1121]] of David [[H1732]] established himself securely [[H2388]] over [[H5921]] his kingdom, [[H4438]] and the LORD [[H3068]] his God [[H430]] was with him [[H5973]] and highly [[H4605]] exalted him. [[H1431]]

###### 2
Then Solomon [[H8010]] spoke [[H559]] to all [[H3605]] Israel, [[H3478]] to the commanders [[H8269]] of thousands [[H505]] and of hundreds, [[H3967]] to the judges, [[H8199]] and to every [[H3605]] leader [[H5387]] in all [[H3605]] Israel— [[H3478]] the heads [[H7218]] of the families. [[H1]]

###### 3
And Solomon [[H8010]] and the whole [[H3605]] assembly [[H6951]] went [[H1980]] to the high place [[H1116]] at Gibeon [[H1391]] because [[H3588]] it was [[H1961]] the location of [[H8033]] God’s [[H430]] Tent [[H168]] of Meeting, [[H4150]] which [[H834]] Moses [[H4872]] the servant [[H5650]] of the LORD [[H3068]] had made [[H6213]] in the wilderness. [[H4057]]

###### 4
Now [[H61]] David [[H1732]] had brought [[H5927]] the ark [[H727]] of God [[H430]] from Kiriath-jearim [[H7157]] to the place [[H1732]] he had prepared [[H3559]] for it,  because [[H3588]] he had pitched [[H5186]] a tent [[H168]] for it  in Jerusalem. [[H3389]]

###### 5
But the bronze [[H5178]] altar [[H4196]] made by [[H6213]] Bezalel [[H1212]] son [[H1121]] of Uri, [[H221]] the son [[H1121]] of Hur, [[H2354]] was [in Gibeon] [[H7760]] before [[H6440]] the tabernacle [[H4908]] of the LORD. [[H3068]] So Solomon [[H8010]] and the assembly [[H6951]] inquired of Him there. [[H1875]]

###### 6
Solomon [[H8010]] offered sacrifices [[H5927]] there [[H8033]] before [[H6440]] the LORD [[H3068]] on [[H5921]] the bronze [[H5178]] altar [[H4196]] at the Tent [[H168]] of Meeting; [[H4150]] on it [[H5921]] he offered [[H5927]] a thousand [[H505]] burnt offerings. [[H5930]]

###### 7
That [[H1931]] night [[H3915]] God [[H430]] appeared [[H7200]] to Solomon [[H8010]] and said, [[H559]] “Ask, [[H7592]] [and] I will give it [[H5414]] to you!” 

###### 8
Solomon [[H8010]] replied [[H559]] to God: [[H430]] “You [[H859]] have shown [[H6213]] great [[H1419]] and loving devotion [[H2617]] to [[H5973]] my father [[H1]] David, [[H1732]] and You have made me king [[H4427]] in his place. [[H8478]]

###### 9
Now, [[H6258]] O LORD [[H3069]] God, [[H430]] let Your promise [[H1697]] to [[H5973]] my father [[H1]] David [[H1732]] be fulfilled. [[H539]] For [[H3588]] You [[H859]] have made me king [[H4427]] over [[H5921]] a people [[H5971]] as numerous [[H7227]] as the dust [[H6083]] of the earth. [[H776]]

###### 10
Now [[H6258]] grant [[H5414]] me  wisdom [[H2451]] and knowledge, [[H4093]] so that I may lead [[H3318]] this [[H2088]] people. [[H5971]] For [[H3588]] who [[H4310]] is able to govern [[H8199]] this [[H2088]] great [[H1419]] people of Yours?” [[H5971]]

###### 11
God [[H430]] said [[H559]] to Solomon, [[H8010]] “Since [[H3282]] this [[H2063]] was [[H1961]] in [[H5973]] your heart [[H3824]] and you have not [[H3808]] requested [[H7592]] riches [[H6239]] or wealth [[H5233]] or glory [[H3519]] or the death [[H5315]] of your enemies— [[H8130]] and since you have not [[H3808]] even [[H1571]] requested [[H7592]] long [[H7227]] life [[H3117]] but have asked [[H7592]] for wisdom [[H2451]] and knowledge [[H4093]] to govern [[H8199]] My people [[H5971]] over [[H5921]] whom [[H834]] I have made you king— [[H4427]]

###### 12
therefore wisdom [[H2451]] and knowledge [[H4093]] have been granted [[H5414]] to you.  And I will also give you [[H5414]] riches [[H6239]] and wealth [[H5233]] and honor [[H3519]] unlike [[H3808]] anything [[H834]] given to the kings [[H4428]] before you [[H6440]] [or] [[H1961]] after you.” [[H310]]

###### 13
So Solomon [[H8010]] went [[H935]] to Jerusalem [[H3389]] from the high place [[H1116]] in Gibeon [[H1391]] before [[H6440]] the Tent [[H168]] of Meeting, [[H4150]] and he reigned [[H4427]] over [[H5921]] Israel. [[H3478]]

###### 14
Solomon [[H8010]] accumulated [[H622]] 1,400 [[H505]] chariots [[H7393]] and 12,000 [[H8147]] horses, [[H6571]] which he stationed [[H1961]] in the chariot [[H7393]] cities [[H5892]] and also with [[H5973]] [him] [[H4428]] in Jerusalem. [[H3389]]

###### 15
The king [[H4428]] made [[H5414]] silver [[H3701]] and gold [[H2091]] as common in Jerusalem [[H3389]] as stones, [[H68]] and [[H853]] cedar [[H730]] as abundant [[H7230]] as sycamore [[H8256]] in the foothills. [[H8219]]

###### 16
Solomon’s [[H834]] horses [[H5483]] were imported [[H4161]] from Egypt [[H4714]] and Kue; [[H4723]] the royal [[H4428]] merchants [[H5503]] purchased them [[H3947]] in Kue. [[H4242]]

###### 17
A chariot [[H4818]] could be imported [[H5927]] from Egypt [[H4714]] for six [[H8337]] hundred [shekels] [[H3967]] of silver, [[H3701]] and a horse [[H5483]] for a hundred [[H3967]] and fifty. [[H2572]] Likewise, [[H3651]] [they] [[H3027]] exported them [[H3318]] to all [[H3605]] the kings [[H4428]] of the Hittites [[H2850]] and to the kings [[H4428]] of Aram. [[H758]]
