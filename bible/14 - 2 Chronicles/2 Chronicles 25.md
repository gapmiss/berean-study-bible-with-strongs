### 1
Amaziah [[H558]] was twenty-five [[H6242]] years old [[H1121]] [when] he became king, [[H4427]] and he reigned [[H4427]] in Jerusalem [[H3389]] twenty-nine [[H6242]] years. [[H8141]] His mother’s [[H517]] name [[H8034]] was Jehoaddan; [[H3086]] she was from Jerusalem. [[H3389]]

### 2
And he did [what was] [[H6213]] right [[H3477]] in the eyes [[H5869]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] but [[H7535]] not wholeheartedly. [[H3808]]

### 3
As soon as [[H834]] the kingdom [[H4467]] was firmly [[H2388]] in his grasp, [[H5921]] Amaziah executed [[H2026]] the servants [[H5650]] who had murdered [[H5221]] his father [[H1]] the king. [[H4428]]

### 4
Yet [[H853]] he did not [[H3808]] put their sons [[H1121]] to death, [[H4191]] according to what is written [[H3789]] in the Law, [[H8451]] in the book [[H5612]] of Moses, [[H4872]] where [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] commanded: [[H6680]] “Fathers [[H1]] must not [[H3808]] be put to death [[H4191]] for [[H5921]] their children, [[H1121]] and children [[H1121]] must not [[H3808]] be put to death [[H4191]] for [[H5921]] their fathers; [[H1]] each [[H376]] is to die [[H4191]] for his own sin. [[H2399]]

### 5
Then Amaziah [[H558]] gathered [[H6908]] [the people of] Judah [[H3063]] and assigned them according to their families [[H1]] to commanders [[H8269]] of thousands [[H505]] [and] [[H8269]] of hundreds. [[H3967]] And he numbered [[H6485]] those twenty [[H6242]] years of age [[H1121]] or older [[H4605]] throughout [[H3605]] Judah [[H3063]] and Benjamin [[H1144]] and found [[H4672]] there to be 300,000 [[H7969]] choice [men], [[H970]] [able] to serve [[H3318]] in the army, [[H6635]] bearing [[H270]] the spear [[H7420]] and shield. [[H6793]]

### 6
He also hired [[H7936]] 100,000 [[H3967]] mighty warriors [[H1368]] from Israel [[H3478]] for a hundred [[H3967]] talents [[H3603]] of silver. [[H3701]]

### 7
But a man [[H376]] of God [[H430]] came [[H935]] to him [[H413]] and said, [[H559]] “O king, [[H4428]] do not let [[H408]] the army [[H6635]] of Israel [[H3478]] go [[H935]] with you, [[H5973]] for [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3069]] is not [[H369]] with [[H5973]] Israel— [[H3478]] [not with] any [[H3605]] of the Ephraimites. [[H1121]]

### 8
Even [[H3588]] if [[H518]] you [[H859]] go [[H935]] and fight [[H6213]] bravely [[H2388]] in battle, [[H4421]] God [[H430]] will make you stumble [[H3782]] before [[H6440]] the enemy, [[H341]] for [[H3588]] God [[H430]] has [[H3426]] power [[H3581]] to help [[H5826]] and [power] to overthrow.” [[H3782]]

### 9
Amaziah [[H558]] asked [[H559]] the man [[H376]] of God, [[H430]] “What [[H4100]] should I do [[H6213]] about the hundred [[H3967]] talents [[H3603]] I have given [[H5414]] to the army [[H1416]] of Israel?” [[H3478]] And the man [[H376]] of God [[H430]] replied, [[H559]] “The LORD [[H3068]] is able to give [[H5414]] you  much more [[H7235]] than this.” [[H2088]]

### 10
So Amaziah [[H558]] dismissed [[H914]] the troops [[H1416]] who [[H834]] had come [[H935]] to him [[H413]] from Ephraim [[H669]] and sent them [[H1980]] home. [[H4725]] And they were furious [[H3966]] with Judah [[H3063]] and returned [[H7725]] home [[H4725]] in great [[H2750]] anger. [[H639]]

### 11
Amaziah, however, [[H558]] summoned his strength [[H2388]] and led [[H5090]] his troops [[H5971]] to the Valley of Salt, [[H1516]] where he struck down [[H5221]] 10,000 {} [[H6235]] men [[H1121]] of Seir, [[H8165]]

### 12
and the army [[H1121]] of Judah [[H3063]] also captured [[H7617]] 10,000 men [[H6235]] alive. [[H2416]] They took [[H935]] them to the top [[H7218]] of a cliff [[H5553]] and threw them down [[H7993]] so that all [[H3605]] were dashed to pieces. [[H1234]]

### 13
Meanwhile [[H1121]] the troops [[H1416]] that [[H834]] Amaziah [[H558]] had dismissed [[H7725]] from battle [[H4421]] raided [[H6584]] the cities [[H5892]] of Judah, [[H3063]] from Samaria [[H8111]] to [[H5704]] Beth-horon. [[H1032]] They struck down [[H5221]] 3,000 people [[H7969]] and carried off [[H962]] a great deal of [[H7227]] plunder. [[H961]]

### 14
After [[H310]] Amaziah [[H558]] returned [[H935]] from the slaughter [[H5221]] of [[H853]] the Edomites, [[H130]] he brought back [[H935]] the gods [[H430]] of the Seirites, [[H1121]] set them up [[H5975]] as his own  gods, [[H430]] bowed [[H7812]] before them, [[H6440]] and burned sacrifices [[H6999]] to them. 

### 15
Therefore the anger [[H639]] of the LORD [[H3068]] burned [[H2734]] against Amaziah, [[H558]] and He sent [[H7971]] him [[H413]] a prophet [[H5030]] who said, [[H559]] “Why [[H4100]] have you sought [[H1875]] this people's [[H5971]] gods, [[H430]] which [[H834]] could not [[H3808]] deliver [[H5337]] [them] [[H5971]] from your hand?” [[H3027]]

### 16
While he was still speaking, [[H1696]] the king asked, [[H559]] “Have we made you [[H5414]] the counselor [[H3289]] to the king? [[H4428]] Stop! [[H2308]] Why [[H4100]] be struck down?” [[H5221]] So the prophet [[H5030]] stopped, [[H2308]] but he said, [[H559]] “I know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] God [[H430]] has determined [[H3289]] to destroy you, [[H7843]] because [[H3588]] you have done [[H6213]] this [[H2063]] and have not [[H3808]] listened [[H8085]] to my advice.” [[H6098]]

### 17
Then Amaziah [[H558]] king [[H4428]] of Judah [[H3063]] took counsel [[H3289]] and sent [[H7971]] word to [[H413]] the king [[H4428]] of Israel, [[H3478]] Jehoash [[H3101]] son [[H1121]] of Jehoahaz, [[H3059]] the son [[H1121]] of Jehu. [[H3058]] “Come,  let us meet [[H7200]] face to face,” [[H6440]] he said. [[H559]]

### 18
But Jehoash [[H3101]] king [[H4428]] of Israel [[H3478]] replied [[H7971]] to [[H413]] Amaziah [[H558]] king [[H4428]] of Judah: [[H3063]] “A thistle [[H2336]] in Lebanon [[H3844]] sent [[H7971]] a message to [[H413]] a cedar [[H730]] in Lebanon, [[H3844]] saying, [[H559]] ‘Give [[H5414]] your daughter [[H1323]] to my son [[H1121]] in marriage.’ [[H802]] Then a wild [[H7704]] beast [[H2416]] in Lebanon [[H3844]] came along [[H5674]] and trampled [[H7429]] the thistle. [[H2336]]

### 19
You have said, [[H559]] ‘Look, [[H2009]] I have defeated [[H5221]] Edom,’ [[H123]] and your heart [[H3820]] has become proud [[H5375]] and boastful. [[H3513]] Now [[H6258]] stay [[H3427]] at home. [[H1004]] Why [[H4100]] should you stir up [[H1624]] trouble [[H7451]] so that you fall— [[H859]] you [[H5307]] and Judah [[H3063]] with you?” [[H5973]]

### 20
But Amaziah [[H558]] would not [[H3808]] listen, [[H8085]] for [[H3588]] this [had come ] [[H1931]] from God [[H430]] in order to [[H4616]] deliver them [[H5414]] into the hand [of Jehoash], [[H3027]] because [[H3588]] they had sought [[H1875]] the gods [[H430]] of Edom. [[H123]]

### 21
So Jehoash [[H3101]] king [[H4428]] of Israel [[H3478]] advanced, [[H5927]] and he [[H1931]] and Amaziah [[H558]] king [[H4428]] of Judah [[H3063]] faced [[H6440]] one another [[H7200]] at Beth-shemesh [[H1053]] in Judah. [[H3063]]

### 22
And Judah [[H3063]] was routed [[H5062]] before [[H6440]] Israel, [[H3478]] and every man [[H376]] fled [[H5127]] to his own home. [[H168]]

### 23
There at Beth-shemesh, [[H1053]] Jehoash [[H3101]] king [[H4428]] of Israel [[H3478]] captured [[H8610]] Amaziah [[H558]] king [[H4428]] of Judah, [[H3063]] the son [[H1121]] of Joash, [[H3101]] the son [[H1121]] of Jehoahaz. [[H3059]] Then Jehoash brought him [[H935]] to Jerusalem [[H3389]] and broke down [[H6555]] the wall [[H2346]] of Jerusalem [[H3389]] from the Ephraim [[H669]] Gate [[H8179]] to [[H5704]] the Corner [[H6437]] Gate [[H8179]] [a section of] four [[H702]] hundred [[H3967]] cubits. [[H520]]

### 24
He took all [[H3605]] the gold [[H2091]] and silver [[H3701]] and [[H853]] all [[H3605]] the articles [[H3627]] found [[H4672]] in the house [[H1004]] of God [[H430]] with [[H5973]] Obed-edom [[H5654]] and [[H853]] in the treasuries [[H214]] of the royal [[H4428]] palace, [[H1004]] as well as some hostages. [[H1121]] Then he returned [[H7725]] to Samaria. [[H8111]]

### 25
Amaziah [[H558]] son [[H1121]] of Joash [[H3101]] king [[H4428]] of Judah [[H3063]] lived [[H2421]] for fifteen [[H2568]] years [[H8141]] after [[H310]] the death [[H4191]] of Joash [[H3101]] son [[H1121]] of Jehoahaz [[H3059]] king [[H4428]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

### 26
As for the rest [[H3499]] of the acts [[H1697]] of Amaziah, [[H558]] from beginning [[H7223]] to end, [[H314]] are they not [[H3808]] written [[H3789]] in [[H5921]] the Book [[H5612]] of the Kings [[H4428]] of Judah [[H3063]] and Israel? [[H3478]]

### 27
From the time [[H6256]] that [[H834]] Amaziah [[H558]] turned [[H5493]] from following [[H310]] the LORD, [[H3068]] a conspiracy [[H7195]] was formed [[H7194]] against him [[H5921]] in Jerusalem, [[H3389]] and he fled [[H5127]] to Lachish. [[H3923]] But men were sent [[H7971]] after him [[H310]] to Lachish, [[H3923]] and they killed him [[H4191]] there. [[H8033]]

### 28
They carried him back [[H5375]] on [[H5921]] horses [[H5483]] and buried [[H6912]] him [[H853]] with [[H5973]] his fathers [[H1]] in the city [[H5892]] of Judah. [[H3063]]
