### 1
Hezekiah [[H2396]] [was] twenty-five [[H6242]] years old [[H1121]] when he became king, [[H4427]] and he reigned [[H4427]] in Jerusalem [[H3389]] twenty-nine [[H6242]] years. [[H8141]] His mother’s [[H517]] name [[H8034]] was Abijah, [[H29]] the daughter [[H1323]] of Zechariah. [[H2148]]

### 2
And he did [[H6213]] [what was] right [[H3477]] in the eyes [[H5869]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] just as [[H3605]] his father [[H1]] David [[H1732]] had done. [[H6213]]

### 3
In the first [[H7223]] month [[H2320]] of the first [[H7223]] year [[H8141]] of his reign, [[H4427]] [Hezekiah] opened [[H6605]] and repaired [[H2388]] the doors [[H1817]] of the house [[H1004]] of the LORD. [[H3068]]

### 4
Then he brought in [[H935]] the priests [[H3548]] and Levites [[H3881]] and gathered them [[H622]] in the square [[H7339]] on the east side. [[H4217]]

### 5
“Listen to me, [[H8085]] O Levites,” [[H3881]] he said. [[H559]] “Consecrate [[H6942]] yourselves now [[H6258]] and consecrate [[H6942]] the house [[H1004]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of your fathers. [[H1]] Remove [[H3318]] from [[H4480]] the Holy Place [[H6944]] every impurity. [[H5079]]

### 6
For [[H3588]] our fathers [[H1]] were unfaithful [[H4603]] and did [[H6213]] evil [[H7451]] in the sight [[H5869]] of the LORD [[H3068]] our God. [[H430]] They abandoned Him, [[H5800]] turned their faces [[H6440]] away [[H5437]] from the dwelling place [[H4908]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] and turned [[H5414]] their backs on Him. [[H6203]]

### 7
They also [[H1571]] shut [[H5462]] the doors [[H1817]] of the portico [[H197]] and extinguished [[H3518]] the lamps. [[H5216]] They did not [[H3808]] burn [[H6999]] incense [[H7004]] [or] [[H3808]] present [[H5927]] burnt offerings [[H5930]] in the Holy Place [[H6944]] of the God [[H430]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

### 8
Therefore, the wrath [[H7110]] of the LORD [[H3068]] has fallen [[H1961]] upon [[H5921]] Judah [[H3063]] and Jerusalem, [[H3389]] and He has made them [[H5414]] an object of terror, [[H2113]] horror, [[H8047]] and mockery, [[H8322]] as [[H834]] you [[H859]] can see [[H7200]] with your own eyes. [[H5869]]

### 9
For behold, [[H2009]] this [[H2063]] is why [[H5921]] our fathers [[H1]] have fallen [[H5307]] by the sword, [[H2719]] and our sons [[H1121]] and daughters [[H1323]] and wives [[H802]] are in captivity. [[H7628]]

### 10
Now [[H6258]] it is in [[H5973]] my heart [[H3824]] to make [[H3772]] a covenant [[H1285]] with the LORD, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] so that His fierce anger [[H2740]] will turn away [[H7725]] from us. [[H4480]]

### 11
Now, [[H6258]] my sons, [[H1121]] do not [[H408]] be negligent, [[H7952]] for [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3069]] has chosen [[H970]] you  to stand [[H5975]] before Him, [[H6440]] to serve Him, [[H8334]] to [[H1961]] minister [[H8334]] before Him,  and to burn incense.” [[H6999]]

### 12
Then the Levites [[H3881]] set to work: [[H6965]] Mahath [[H4287]] son [[H1121]] of Amasai [[H6022]] and Joel [[H3100]] son [[H1121]] of Azariah [[H5838]] from [[H4480]] the Kohathites; [[H1121]] Kish [[H7027]] son [[H1121]] of Abdi [[H5660]] and Azariah [[H5838]] son [[H1121]] of Jehallelel [[H3094]] from [[H4480]] the Merarites; [[H1121]] Joah [[H3098]] son [[H1121]] of Zimmah [[H2155]] and Eden [[H5731]] son [[H1121]] of Joah [[H3098]] from [[H4480]] the Gershonites; [[H1649]]

### 13
Shimri [[H8113]] and Jeuel  from [[H4480]] the Elizaphanites; [[H1121]] Zechariah [[H2148]] and Mattaniah [[H4983]] from [[H4480]] the Asaphites; [[H1121]]

### 14
Jehiel [[H3171]] and Shimei [[H8096]] from [[H4480]] the Hemanites; [[H1121]] [and] Shemaiah [[H8098]] and Uzziel [[H5816]] from [[H4480]] the Jeduthunites. [[H1121]]

### 15
When they had assembled [[H622]] their brothers [[H251]] and consecrated themselves, [[H6942]] they went in [[H935]] to cleanse [[H2891]] the house [[H1004]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] according to the command [[H4687]] of the king [[H4428]] by the words [[H1697]] of the LORD. [[H3068]]

### 16
So the priests [[H3548]] went [[H935]] inside [[H6441]] the house [[H1004]] of the LORD [[H3068]] to cleanse [it], [[H2891]] and they brought out [[H3318]] to the courtyard [[H2691]] all [[H3605]] the unclean things [[H2932]] that [[H834]] they found [[H4672]] in the temple [[H1964]] of the LORD. [[H3068]] Then the Levites [[H3881]] took [these things] [[H6901]] and carried [them] [[H3318]] out [[H2351]] to the Kidron [[H6939]] Valley. [[H5158]]

### 17
They began [[H2490]] the consecration [[H6942]] on the first [[H259]] day of the first [[H7223]] month, [[H2320]] and on the eighth [[H8083]] day [[H3117]] of the month [[H2320]] they reached [[H935]] the portico [[H197]] of the LORD. [[H3068]] For eight [more] [[H8083]] days [[H3117]] they consecrated [[H6942]] the house [[H1004]] of the LORD [itself], [[H3068]] finishing [[H3615]] on the sixteenth [[H8337]] day [[H3117]] of the first [[H7223]] month. [[H2320]]

### 18
Then they went [[H935]] in [[H6441]] to [[H413]] King [[H4428]] Hezekiah [[H2396]] and reported, [[H559]] “We have cleansed [[H2891]] the entire [[H3605]] house [[H1004]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] the altar [[H4196]] of burnt offering [[H5930]] with all [[H3605]] its utensils, [[H3627]] and the table [[H7979]] of the showbread [[H4635]] with [[H853]] all [[H3605]] its utensils. [[H3627]]

### 19
Moreover, [[H854]] we have prepared [[H3559]] and consecrated [[H6942]] all [[H3605]] the articles [[H3627]] that [[H834]] King [[H4428]] Ahaz [[H271]] in his unfaithfulness [[H4604]] cast aside [[H2186]] during his reign. [[H4438]] They are now in front [[H6440]] of the altar [[H4196]] of the LORD.” [[H3068]]

### 20
Early the next morning [[H7925]] King [[H4428]] Hezekiah [[H2396]] gathered [[H622]] the city [[H5892]] officials [[H8269]] and went [[H5927]] up to the house [[H1004]] of the LORD. [[H3068]]

### 21
They brought [[H935]] seven [[H7651]] bulls, [[H6499]] seven [[H7651]] rams, [[H352]] seven [[H7651]] lambs, [[H3532]] and seven [[H7651]] male goats [[H6842]] as a sin offering [[H2403]] for [[H5921]] the kingdom, [[H4467]] for [[H5921]] the sanctuary, [[H4720]] and for [[H5921]] Judah. [[H3063]] And [the king] commanded [[H559]] the priests, [[H3548]] the descendants [[H1121]] of Aaron, [[H175]] to offer [[H5927]] them on [[H5921]] the altar [[H4196]] of the LORD. [[H3068]]

### 22
So they slaughtered [[H7819]] the bulls, [[H1241]] and the priests [[H3548]] took [[H6901]] the blood [[H1818]] and sprinkled [[H2236]] it on the altar. [[H4196]] They slaughtered [[H7819]] the rams [[H352]] and sprinkled [[H2236]] the blood [[H1818]] on the altar. [[H4196]] And they slaughtered [[H7819]] the lambs [[H3532]] and sprinkled [[H2236]] the blood [[H1818]] on the altar. [[H4196]]

### 23
Then they brought [[H5066]] the goats [[H8163]] for the sin offering [[H2403]] before [[H6440]] the king [[H4428]] and the assembly, [[H6951]] who laid [[H5564]] their hands [[H3027]] on them. [[H5921]]

### 24
And the priests [[H3548]] slaughtered the goats [[H7819]] and put their blood [[H1818]] on the altar [[H4196]] for a sin offering, [[H2398]] to make atonement [[H3722]] for [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] Israel, [[H3478]] for [[H3588]] the king [[H4428]] had ordered [[H559]] that the burnt offering [[H5930]] and sin offering [[H2403]] were for all [[H3605]] Israel. [[H3478]]

### 25
Hezekiah stationed [[H5975]] the Levites [[H3881]] in the house [[H1004]] of the LORD [[H3068]] with cymbals, [[H4700]] harps, [[H5035]] and lyres [[H3658]] according to the command [[H4687]] of David, [[H1732]] of Gad [[H1410]] the king’s [[H4428]] seer, [[H2374]] and of Nathan [[H5416]] the prophet. [[H5030]] For [[H3588]] the command [[H4687]] had come from [[H3027]] the LORD [[H3068]] through [[H3027]] His prophets. [[H5030]]

### 26
The Levites [[H3881]] stood [[H5975]] with the instruments [[H3627]] of David, [[H1732]] and the priests [[H3548]] with the trumpets. [[H2689]]

### 27
And Hezekiah [[H2396]] ordered [[H559]] that the burnt offering [[H5930]] be sacrificed [[H5927]] on the altar. [[H4196]] When [[H6256]] the burnt offering [[H5930]] began, [[H2490]] the song [[H7892]] of the LORD [[H3068]] and the trumpets [[H2689]] began as well, [[H2490]] accompanied by [[H5921]] the instruments [[H3627]] of David [[H1732]] king [[H4428]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

### 28
The whole [[H3605]] assembly [[H6951]] was worshiping, [[H7812]] the singers [[H7892]] were singing, [[H7891]] and the trumpeters [[H2689]] were playing. [[H2690]] All this [[H3605]] continued until [[H5704]] the burnt offering [[H5930]] was completed. [[H3615]]

### 29
When the offerings [[H5927]] were completed, [[H3615]] the king [[H4428]] and all [[H3605]] those present [[H4672]] with [[H854]] him bowed down [[H3766]] and worshiped. [[H7812]]

### 30
Then King [[H4428]] Hezekiah [[H2396]] and his officials [[H8269]] ordered [[H559]] the Levites [[H3881]] to sing praises [[H1984]] to the LORD [[H3068]] in the words [[H1697]] of David [[H1732]] and of Asaph [[H623]] the seer. [[H2374]] So they sang praises [[H1984]] with gladness [[H8057]] and bowed their heads [[H6915]] and worshiped. [[H7812]]

### 31
Then Hezekiah [[H2396]] said, [[H559]] “Now [[H6258]] [that] you have consecrated [[H4390]] yourselves [[H3027]] to the LORD, [[H3068]] come near [[H5066]] and bring [[H935]] sacrifices [[H2077]] and thank offerings [[H8426]] to the house [[H1004]] of the LORD.” [[H3068]] So the assembly [[H6951]] brought [[H935]] sacrifices [[H2077]] and thank offerings, [[H8426]] and all [[H3605]] whose hearts [[H3820]] were willing [[H5081]] brought burnt offerings. [[H5930]]

### 32
The number [[H4557]] of burnt offerings [[H5930]] the assembly [[H6951]] brought [[H935]] was [[H1961]] seventy [[H7657]] bulls, [[H1241]] a hundred [[H3967]] rams, [[H352]] [and] two hundred [[H3967]] lambs; [[H3532]] all [[H3605]] these [[H428]] were for a burnt offering [[H5930]] to the LORD. [[H3068]]

### 33
And the consecrated offerings [were] [[H6942]] six [[H8337]] hundred [[H3967]] bulls [[H1241]] and three [[H7969]] thousand [[H505]] sheep. [[H6629]]

### 34
However, [[H7535]] since there were [[H1961]] not enough [[H4592]] priests [[H3548]] to skin [[H6584]] all [[H3605]] the burnt offerings, [[H5930]] their Levite [[H3881]] brothers [[H251]] helped [[H2388]] them until [[H5704]] the work [[H4399]] was finished [[H3615]] and until [[H5704]] the priests [[H3548]] had been consecrated. [[H6942]] For [[H3588]] the Levites [[H3881]] had been more diligent [[H3477]] in consecrating themselves [[H6942]] than the priests had been. [[H3548]]

### 35
Furthermore, [[H1571]] the burnt offerings were abundant, [[H5930]] along with the fat [[H2459]] of the peace offerings [[H8002]] and with the drink offerings [[H5262]] for the burnt offering. [[H5930]] So the service [[H5656]] of the house [[H1004]] of the LORD [[H3068]] was established. [[H3559]]

### 36
Then Hezekiah [[H2396]] and all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] rejoiced [[H8055]] at what [[H5921]] God [[H430]] had prepared [[H3559]] for the people, [[H5971]] because [[H3588]] everything [[H1697]] had been accomplished [[H1961]] so quickly. [[H6597]]
