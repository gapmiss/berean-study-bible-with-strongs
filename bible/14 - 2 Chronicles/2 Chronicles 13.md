###### 1
In the eighteenth [[H8083]] year [[H8141]] of the reign [[H4428]] of Jeroboam, [[H3379]] Abijah [[H29]] became king [[H4427]] of [[H5921]] Judah, [[H3063]]

###### 2
and he reigned [[H4427]] in Jerusalem [[H3389]] three [[H7969]] years. [[H8141]] His mother’s [[H517]] name [[H8034]] was Micaiah [[H4322]] daughter [[H1323]] of Uriel; [[H222]] she was from [[H4480]] Gibeah. [[H1390]] And there was [[H1961]] war [[H4421]] between [[H996]] Abijah [[H29]] and Jeroboam. [[H3379]]

###### 3
Abijah [[H29]] went [[H631]] into battle [[H4421]] with an army [[H2428]] of 400,000 [[H702]] choice [[H970]] men, [[H376]] while Jeroboam [[H3379]] drew up in formation [[H6186]] against him [[H5973]] with his army [[H2428]] of 800,000 [[H8083]] choice [[H970]] men. [[H376]]

###### 4
Then Abijah [[H29]] stood [[H6965]] on [[H5921]] Mount [[H2022]] Zemaraim, [[H6787]] which [[H834]] is in the hill country [[H2022]] of Ephraim, [[H669]] and said, [[H559]] “Hear me, [[H8085]] O Jeroboam [[H3379]] and all [[H3605]] Israel! [[H3478]]

###### 5
Do you not [[H3808]] know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] the LORD, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] has given [[H5414]] the kingship [[H4467]] of [[H5921]] Israel [[H3478]] to David [[H1732]] and his descendants [[H1121]] forever [[H5769]] by a covenant [[H1285]] of salt? [[H4417]]

###### 6
Yet Jeroboam [[H3379]] son [[H1121]] of Nebat, [[H5028]] a servant [[H5650]] of Solomon [[H8010]] son [[H1121]] of David, [[H1732]] rose up [[H6965]] and rebelled [[H4775]] against [[H5921]] his master. [[H113]]

###### 7
Then worthless [[H7386]] and wicked [[H1100]] men [[H1121]] gathered [[H6908]] around him [[H5921]] to resist [[H553]] Rehoboam [[H7346]] son [[H1121]] of Solomon [[H8010]] when [he] [[H7346]] was [[H1961]] young, [[H5288]] inexperienced, [[H7390]] and unable [[H3808]] to resist [[H2388]] them. [[H6440]]

###### 8
And now [[H6258]] you [[H859]] think [[H559]] you can resist [[H2388]] the kingdom [[H4467]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] which is in the hands [[H3027]] of David’s [[H1732]] descendants. [[H1121]] You [[H859]] are indeed a vast [[H7227]] army, [[H1995]] and you have with you [[H5973]] the golden [[H2091]] calves [[H5695]] that [[H834]] Jeroboam [[H3379]] made [[H6213]] for you  as gods. [[H430]]

###### 9
But did you not [[H3808]] drive out [[H5080]] the priests [[H3548]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] the descendants [[H1121]] of Aaron, [[H175]] and the Levites, [[H3881]] and make [[H6213]] priests [[H3548]] for yourselves  as do the peoples [[H5971]] of other lands? [[H776]] Now whoever [[H3605]] comes [[H935]] to consecrate [[H4390]] himself [[H3027]] with a young bull [[H6499]] and seven [[H7651]] rams [[H352]] can become [[H1961]] a priest [[H3548]] of [things that are] not [[H3808]] gods. [[H430]]

###### 10
But as for us, [[H587]] the LORD [[H3068]] is our God. [[H430]] We have not [[H3808]] forsaken Him; [[H5800]] the priests [[H3548]] ministering [[H8334]] to the LORD [[H3068]] are descendants [[H1121]] of Aaron, [[H175]] and the Levites [[H3881]] [attend] to [their] duties. [[H4399]]

###### 11
Every morning [[H1242]] and every evening [[H6153]] they present [[H6999]] burnt offerings [[H5930]] and fragrant [[H5561]] incense [[H7004]] to the LORD. [[H3068]] They set out the rows [[H4635]] of showbread [[H3899]] on [[H5921]] the ceremonially clean [[H2889]] table, [[H7979]] and every evening [[H6153]] they light [[H1197]] the lamps [[H5216]] of the gold [[H2091]] lampstand. [[H4501]] We [[H587]] are carrying out [[H8104]] the requirements [[H4931]] of the LORD [[H3068]] our God, [[H430]] while you [[H859]] have forsaken [[H5800]] Him. [[H853]]

###### 12
Now behold, [[H2009]] God Himself is [[H430]] with us [[H5973]] as [our] head, [[H7218]] and His priests [[H3548]] with their trumpets [[H2689]] sound [[H7321]] the battle call [[H8643]] against you. [[H5921]] O children [[H1121]] of Israel, [[H3478]] do not [[H408]] fight [[H3898]] against [[H5973]] the LORD, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of your fathers, [[H1]] for [[H3588]] you will not [[H3808]] succeed.” [[H6743]]

###### 13
Now Jeroboam [[H3379]] had sent an ambush [[H3993]] around [[H5437]] to advance [[H935]] from the rear, [[H310]] so that while he was [[H1961]] in front [[H6440]] of Judah, [[H3063]] the ambush [[H3993]] was behind them. [[H310]]

###### 14
When Judah [[H3063]] turned [[H6437]] and discovered [[H2009]] that the battle [[H4421]] [was] before [[H6440]] and behind them, [[H268]] they cried out [[H6817]] to the LORD. [[H3068]] Then the priests [[H3548]] blew [[H2690]] the trumpets, [[H2689]]

###### 15
and the men [[H376]] of Judah [[H3063]] raised the battle cry. [[H7321]] And when [they] [[H376]] raised the cry, [[H7321]] God [[H430]] routed [[H5062]] Jeroboam [[H3379]] and all [[H3605]] Israel [[H3478]] before [[H6440]] Abijah [[H29]] and Judah. [[H3063]]

###### 16
So the Israelites [[H1121]] fled [[H5127]] before [[H6440]] Judah, [[H3063]] and God [[H430]] delivered them [[H5414]] into their hands. [[H3027]]

###### 17
Then Abijah [[H29]] and his people [[H5971]] struck [[H5221]] them  with a mighty [[H7227]] blow, [[H4347]] and 500,000 [[H2568]] choice [[H970]] men [[H376]] of Israel [[H3478]] fell [[H5307]] slain. [[H2491]]

###### 18
Thus the Israelites [[H1121]] were subdued [[H3665]] at that [[H1931]] time, [[H6256]] and the men [[H1121]] of Judah [[H3063]] prevailed [[H553]] because [[H3588]] they relied [[H8172]] on [[H5921]] the LORD, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of their fathers. [[H1]]

###### 19
Abijah [[H29]] pursued [[H7291]] Jeroboam [[H3379]] and captured [[H3920]] some cities [[H5892]] from him: [[H4480]] Bethel, [[H1008]] Jeshanah, [[H3466]] and Ephron, [[H6085]] along with their villages. [[H1323]]

###### 20
Jeroboam [[H3379]] did not [[H3808]] again [[H5750]] recover [[H6113]] his power [[H3581]] during the days [[H3117]] of Abijah, [[H29]] and the LORD [[H3068]] struck him down [[H5062]] and he died. [[H4191]]

###### 21
But Abijah [[H29]] grew strong, [[H2388]] married [[H5375]] fourteen [[H702]] wives, [[H802]] and became the father [[H3205]] of twenty-two [[H6242]] sons [[H1121]] and sixteen [[H8337]] daughters. [[H1323]]

###### 22
As for the rest [[H3499]] of the acts [[H1697]] of Abijah, [[H29]] along with his ways [[H1870]] and his sayings, [[H1697]] they are written [[H3789]] in the Treatise [[H4097]] of the Prophet [[H5030]] Iddo. [[H5714]]
