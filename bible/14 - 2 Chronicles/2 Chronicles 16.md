### 1
In the thirty-sixth [[H7970]] year [[H8141]] of Asa's [reign], [[H609]] Baasha [[H1201]] king [[H4428]] of Israel [[H3478]] went up [[H5927]] against [[H5921]] Judah [[H3063]] and fortified [[H1129]] Ramah [[H7414]] to prevent [[H1115]] [anyone] from leaving [[H3318]] or entering the territory [[H935]] of Asa [[H609]] king [[H4428]] of Judah. [[H3063]]

### 2
So Asa [[H609]] withdrew [[H3318]] the silver [[H3701]] and gold [[H2091]] from the treasuries [[H214]] of the house [[H1004]] of the LORD [[H3068]] and of the royal [[H4428]] palace [[H1004]] and sent [[H7971]] it to [[H413]] Ben-hadad [[H1130]] king [[H4428]] of Aram, [[H758]] who lived [[H3427]] in Damascus, [[H1834]] with this message: [[H559]]

### 3
“[Let there be] a treaty [[H1285]] between me and you, [[H996]] between [[H996]] my father [[H1]] and your father. [[H1]] See, [[H2009]] I have sent [[H7971]] you silver [[H3701]] and gold. [[H2091]] Now go [[H1980]] and break [[H6565]] your treaty [[H1285]] with [[H854]] Baasha [[H1201]] king [[H4428]] of Israel, [[H3478]] so that he will withdraw [[H5927]] from me.” [[H5921]]

### 4
And Ben-hadad [[H1130]] listened [[H8085]] to [[H413]] King [[H4428]] Asa [[H609]] and sent [[H7971]] the commanders [[H8269]] of his armies [[H2428]] against [[H413]] the cities [[H5892]] of Israel, [[H3478]] conquering [[H5221]] Ijon, [[H5859]] Dan, [[H1835]] Abel-maim, [[H66]] and all [[H3605]] the store [[H4543]] cities [[H5892]] of Naphtali. [[H5321]]

### 5
When Baasha [[H1201]] learned of this, [[H8085]] he stopped [[H2308]] fortifying [[H1129]] Ramah [[H7414]] and abandoned [[H7673]] his work. [[H4399]]

### 6
Then King [[H4428]] Asa [[H609]] brought [[H3947]] all [the men] [[H3605]] of Judah, [[H3063]] and they carried away [[H5375]] the stones [[H68]] of Ramah [[H7414]] and the timbers [[H6086]] Baasha [[H1201]] had used for building. [[H1129]] And with [these materials]  he built up [[H1129]] Geba [[H1387]] and Mizpah. [[H4709]]

### 7
At that [[H1931]] time, [[H6256]] Hanani [[H2607]] the seer [[H7200]] came [[H935]] to [[H413]] King [[H4428]] Asa [[H609]] of Judah [[H3063]] and told [[H559]] him, [[H413]] “Because you have relied [[H8172]] on [[H5921]] the king [[H4428]] of Aram [[H758]] and not [[H3808]] on [[H5921]] the LORD [[H3069]] your God, [[H430]] the army [[H2426]] of the king [[H4428]] of Aram [[H758]] has escaped [[H4422]] from your hand. [[H3027]]

### 8
Were [[H1961]] not [[H3808]] the Cushites [[H3569]] and Libyans [[H3864]] a vast [[H7230]] army [[H2428]] with many [[H7235]] chariots [[H7393]] and horsemen? [[H6571]] Yet because you relied [[H8172]] on [[H5921]] the LORD, [[H3068]] He delivered them [[H5414]] into your hand. [[H3027]]

### 9
For [[H3588]] the eyes [[H5869]] of the LORD [[H3068]] roam [[H7751]] throughout [[H3605]] the earth [[H776]] to show Himself strong [[H2388]] on behalf of [those] [[H5973]] whose heart [[H3824]] is fully devoted [[H8003]] to Him. [[H413]] You have acted foolishly [[H5528]] in [[H5921]] this matter. [[H2063]] From now on, [[H6258]] therefore, [[H3588]] you will be at [[H3426]] war.” [[H4421]]

### 10
Asa [[H609]] was angry [[H3707]] with [[H413]] the seer [[H7200]] and put [[H5414]] him in prison [[H1004]] because [[H3588]] [he was] so enraged [[H2197]] over [[H5921]] this matter. [[H2063]] And at the same [[H1931]] time [[H6256]] Asa [[H609]] oppressed [[H7533]] some of [[H4480]] the people. [[H5971]]

### 11
Now the rest [[H2009]] of the acts [[H1697]] of Asa, [[H609]] from beginning [[H7223]] to end, [[H314]] they are indeed [[H2005]] written [[H3789]] in [[H5921]] the Book [[H5612]] of the Kings [[H4428]] of Judah [[H3063]] and Israel. [[H3478]]

### 12
In the thirty-ninth [[H7970]] year [[H8141]] of his reign, [[H4438]] Asa [[H609]] became diseased [[H2456]] in his feet, [[H7272]] and [[H5704]] it became increasingly severe. [[H2483]] Yet even [[H1571]] in his illness [[H2483]] he did not [[H3808]] seek [[H1875]] the LORD, [[H3068]] but [[H3588]] only the physicians. [[H7495]]

### 13
So in the forty-first [[H705]] year [[H8141]] of his reign, [[H4427]] Asa [[H609]] died [[H4191]] and rested [[H7901]] with [[H5973]] his fathers. [[H1]]

### 14
And he was buried [[H6912]] in the tomb [[H6913]] that [[H834]] he had cut out [[H3738]] for himself  in the City [[H5892]] of David. [[H1732]] They laid him [[H7901]] on a bier [[H4904]] that [[H834]] was full of [[H4390]] spices [[H1314]] and various [[H2177]] blended [[H4639]] perfumes; [[H4842]] then they made a great [[H1419]] fire [[H8313]] in his honor.
