### 1
Then [[H227]] Solomon [[H8010]] said: [[H559]] “The LORD [[H3068]] said [[H559]] that He would dwell [[H7931]] in the thick cloud; [[H6205]]

### 2
and I [[H589]] have built [[H1129]] You  an exalted [[H2073]] house, [[H1004]] a place [[H4349]] for You to dwell [[H3427]] forever.” [[H5769]]

### 3
And as the whole [[H3605]] assembly [[H6951]] of Israel [[H3478]] stood [there], [[H5975]] the king [[H4428]] turned around [[H5437]] and blessed [[H1288]] [them] all [[H3605]]

### 4
and said: [[H559]] “Blessed [be] [[H1288]] the LORD, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] [who] [[H834]] has fulfilled [[H4390]] with His own hand [[H3027]] what He spoke [[H1696]] with His mouth [[H6310]] to [[H853]] my father [[H1]] David, [[H1732]] saying, [[H559]]

### 5
‘Since [[H4480]] the day [[H3117]] I brought My people [[H5971]] out [[H776]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] I have not [[H3808]] chosen [[H977]] a city [[H5892]] from any [[H3605]] tribe [[H7626]] of Israel [[H3478]] [in which] to build [[H1129]] a house [[H1004]] so that My Name [[H8034]] would be [[H1961]] there, [[H8033]] nor [[H3808]] have I chosen [[H977]] anyone [[H376]] to be [[H1961]] ruler [[H5057]] over [[H5921]] My people [[H5971]] Israel. [[H3478]]

### 6
But I have chosen [[H977]] Jerusalem [[H3389]] so that My Name [[H8034]] will be [[H1961]] there, [[H8033]] and I have chosen [[H977]] David [[H1732]] to be [[H1961]] over [[H5921]] My people [[H5971]] Israel.’ [[H3478]]

### 7
Now it was [[H1961]] in [[H5973]] the heart [[H3824]] of my father [[H1]] David [[H1732]] to build [[H1129]] a house [[H1004]] for the Name [[H8034]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

### 8
But the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] my father [[H1]] David, [[H1732]] ‘Since [[H3282]] it was [[H1961]] in [[H5973]] your heart [[H3824]] to build [[H1129]] a house [[H1004]] for My Name, [[H8034]] you have done well [[H2895]] to have this [[H3588]] in [[H5973]] your heart. [[H3824]]

### 9
Nevertheless, [[H7535]] you [[H859]] are not [[H3808]] the one to build [it]; [[H1129]] but [[H3588]] your son, [[H1121]] your own offspring, [[H3318]] will build [[H1129]] the house [[H1004]] for My Name.’ [[H8034]]

### 10
Now the LORD [[H3068]] has fulfilled [[H6965]] the word [[H1697]] that [[H834]] He spoke. [[H1696]] I have succeeded [[H6965]] my father [[H1]] David, [[H1732]] and I sit [[H3427]] on [[H5921]] the throne [[H3678]] of Israel, [[H3478]] as [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] promised. [[H1696]] I have built [[H1129]] the house [[H1004]] for the Name [[H8034]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

### 11
And there I have provided [[H7760]] a place [[H853]] for the ark, [[H727]] which contains [[H8033]] the covenant [[H1285]] of the LORD [[H3068]] that [[H834]] He made [[H3772]] with [[H5973]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel.” [[H3478]]

### 12
Then [Solomon] stood [[H5975]] before [[H6440]] the altar [[H4196]] of the LORD [[H3068]] in front of [[H5048]] the whole [[H3605]] assembly [[H6951]] of Israel [[H3478]] and spread out [[H6566]] his hands. [[H3709]]

### 13
Now [[H3588]] Solomon [[H8010]] had made [[H6213]] a bronze [[H5178]] platform [[H3595]] five [[H2568]] cubits [[H520]] long, [[H753]] five [[H2568]] cubits [[H520]] wide, [[H7341]] and three [[H7969]] cubits [[H520]] high, [[H6967]] and had placed it [[H5414]] in the middle [[H8432]] of the courtyard. [[H5835]] He stood [[H5975]] on it, [[H5921]] knelt down [[H1288]] before [[H5048]] the whole [[H3605]] assembly [[H6951]] of Israel, [[H3478]] spread out [[H6566]] his hands [[H3709]] toward heaven, [[H8064]]

### 14
and said: [[H559]] “O LORD, [[H3068]] God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] there is no [[H369]] God [[H430]] like You [[H3644]] in heaven [[H8064]] or on earth, [[H776]] keeping [[H8104]] [Your] covenant [[H1285]] of loving devotion [[H2617]] with Your servants [[H5650]] who walk [[H1980]] before You [[H6440]] with all [[H3605]] their hearts. [[H3820]]

### 15
You have kept [[H8104]] Your promise [[H1696]] to Your servant, [[H5650]] my father [[H1]] David. [[H1732]] What You spoke [[H1696]] with Your mouth [[H6310]] You have fulfilled [[H4390]] with Your hand [[H3027]] this [[H2088]] day. [[H3117]]

### 16
Therefore now, [[H6258]] O LORD, [[H3068]] God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] keep [[H8104]] for Your servant, [[H5650]] my father [[H1]] David, [[H1732]] what [[H834]] You promised [[H1696]] when You said: [[H559]] ‘You will never [[H3808]] fail [[H3772]] to have a man [[H376]] to sit [[H3427]] before Me [[H6440]] on [[H5921]] the throne [[H3678]] of Israel, [[H3478]] if [[H518]] only [[H7535]] your descendants [[H1121]] guard [[H8104]] their way [[H1870]] to walk [[H1980]] in My Law [[H8451]] as [[H834]] you have walked [[H1980]] before Me. [[H6440]]

### 17
And now, [[H6258]] O LORD, [[H3068]] God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] please confirm [[H539]] what [[H834]] You promised [[H1696]] to Your servant [[H5650]] David. [[H1732]]

### 18
But [[H3588]] will God [[H430]] indeed [[H552]] dwell [[H3427]] with [[H854]] man [[H120]] upon [[H5921]] the earth? [[H776]] Even [[H2009]] heaven, [[H8064]] the highest heaven, [[H8064]] cannot [[H3808]] contain You, [[H3557]] much less [[H637]] this [[H2088]] temple [[H1004]] I have built. [[H1129]]

### 19
Yet regard [[H6437]] the prayer [[H8605]] and [[H413]] plea [[H8467]] of Your servant, [[H5650]] O LORD [[H3068]] my God, [[H430]] so that You may hear [[H8085]] the cry [[H7440]] and the prayer [[H8605]] that [[H834]] Your servant [[H5650]] is praying [[H6419]] before You. [[H6440]]

### 20
May Your eyes [[H1961]] be [[H5869]] open [[H6605]] toward [[H413]] this [[H2088]] temple [[H1004]] day [[H3119]] and night, [[H3915]] toward [[H413]] the place [[H4725]] of which [[H834]] You said [[H559]] You would put [[H7760]] Your Name [[H8034]] there, [[H8033]] so that You may hear [[H8085]] the prayer [[H8605]] that [[H834]] Your servant [[H5650]] prays [[H6419]] toward [[H413]] this [[H2088]] place. [[H4725]]

### 21
Hear [[H8085]] the plea [[H8469]] of Your servant [[H5650]] and Your people [[H5971]] Israel [[H3478]] when [[H834]] they pray [[H6419]] toward [[H413]] this [[H2088]] place. [[H4725]] May You [[H859]] hear [[H8085]] from [[H4480]] heaven, [[H8064]] Your dwelling [[H3427]] place. [[H4725]] May You hear [[H8085]] and forgive. [[H5545]]

### 22
When [[H518]] a man [[H376]] sins [[H2398]] against his neighbor [[H7453]] and is required [[H5375]] to take an oath, [[H422]] and he comes [[H935]] to take an oath [[H423]] before [[H6440]] Your altar [[H4196]] in this [[H2088]] temple, [[H1004]]

### 23
may You [[H859]] hear [[H8085]] from [[H4480]] heaven [[H8064]] and act. [[H6213]] May You judge [[H8199]] Your servants, [[H5650]] condemning [[H7725]] the wicked man [[H7563]] by bringing [[H5414]] down on his own head [[H7218]] what he has done, [[H1870]] and justifying [[H6663]] the righteous man [[H6662]] by rewarding [[H5414]] him  according to his righteousness. [[H6666]]

### 24
When [[H518]] Your people [[H5971]] Israel [[H3478]] are defeated [[H5062]] before [[H6440]] an enemy [[H341]] because [[H3588]] they have sinned against You, [[H2398]] and they return [[H7725]] to You  and confess [[H3034]] Your name, [[H8034]] praying [[H6419]] and pleading [[H2603]] before [[H6440]] You in this [[H2088]] house, [[H1004]]

### 25
may You [[H859]] hear [[H8085]] from [[H4480]] heaven [[H8064]] and forgive [[H5545]] the sin [[H2403]] of Your people [[H5971]] Israel. [[H3478]] May You restore [[H7725]] them to [[H413]] the land [[H127]] You gave [[H5414]] to them [[H1992]] and their fathers. [[H1]]

### 26
When the skies [[H8064]] are shut [[H6113]] and there is [[H1961]] no [[H3808]] rain [[H4306]] because [[H3588]] [Your people] have sinned [[H2398]] against You,  and they pray [[H6419]] toward [[H413]] this [[H2088]] place [[H4725]] and confess [[H3034]] Your name, [[H8034]] and they turn [[H7725]] from their sins [[H2403]] because [[H3588]] You have afflicted them, [[H6031]]

### 27
may You [[H859]] hear [[H8085]] from heaven [[H8064]] and forgive [[H5545]] the sin [[H2403]] of Your servants, [[H5650]] Your people [[H5971]] Israel, [[H3478]] so that [[H3588]] You may teach them [[H3384]] the good [[H2896]] way [[H1870]] in which [[H834]] they should walk. [[H1980]] May You send [[H5414]] rain [[H4306]] on [[H5921]] the land [[H776]] that [[H834]] You gave [[H5414]] Your people [[H5971]] as an inheritance. [[H5159]]

### 28
When [[H3588]] famine [[H7458]] [or] [[H1961]] pestilence [[H1698]] comes [[H1961]] upon the land, [[H776]] [or] [[H3588]] blight [[H7711]] [or] mildew [[H3420]] [or] locusts [[H697]] [or] grasshoppers, [[H2625]] when [[H3588]] their enemies [[H341]] besiege [[H6696]] them  in [[H776]] their cities, [[H8179]] whatever [[H3605]] plague [[H5061]] [or] [[H3605]] sickness [there is], [[H4245]]

### 29
may whatever [[H3605]] prayer [[H8605]] or petition [[H8467]] Your people [[H5971]] Israel [[H3478]] make— [[H1961]] each [[H376]] knowing [[H3045]] his own [[H5061]] afflictions [[H4341]] and spreading out [[H6566]] his hands [[H3709]] toward [[H413]] this [[H2088]] house— [[H1004]]

### 30
be heard [[H8085]] by You [[H859]] from [[H4480]] heaven, [[H8064]] Your dwelling [[H3427]] place. [[H4349]] And may You forgive [[H5545]] and repay [[H5414]] each man [[H376]] according to all [[H3605]] his ways, [[H1870]] since [[H834]] You know [[H3045]] his heart— [[H3824]] for [[H3588]] You [[H859]] alone [[H905]] know [[H3045]] the hearts [[H3824]] of men— [[H120]]

### 31
so that [[H4616]] they may fear You [[H3372]] and walk [[H1980]] in Your ways [[H1870]] all [[H3605]] the days [[H3117]] they [[H1992]] live [[H2416]] in [[H5921]] the land [[H127]] You gave [[H5414]] to our fathers. [[H1]]

### 32
And [[H1571]] as for [[H413]] the foreigner [[H5237]] who [[H834]] is not [[H3808]] of Your people [[H5971]] Israel [[H3478]] but has come [[H935]] from a distant [[H7350]] land [[H776]] because of [[H4616]] Your great [[H1419]] name [[H8034]] and Your mighty [[H2389]] hand [[H3027]] and outstretched [[H5186]] arm— [[H2220]] when he comes [[H935]] and prays [[H6419]] toward [[H413]] this [[H2088]] house, [[H1004]]

### 33
may You [[H859]] hear [[H8085]] from [[H4480]] heaven, [[H8064]] Your dwelling [[H3427]] place, [[H4349]] and do [[H6213]] according to all [[H3605]] for which [[H834]] the foreigner [[H5237]] calls [[H7121]] to You. [[H413]] Then [[H4616]] all [[H3605]] the peoples [[H5971]] of the earth [[H776]] will know [[H3045]] Your name [[H8034]] and fear [[H3372]] You, [[H853]] as [do] Your people [[H5971]] Israel, [[H3478]] and they will know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] this [[H2088]] house [[H1004]] I have built [[H1129]] is called [[H7121]] by Your Name. [[H8034]]

### 34
When [[H3588]] Your people [[H5971]] go [[H3318]] to war [[H4421]] against [[H5921]] their enemies, [[H341]] wherever [[H1870]] You send them, [[H7971]] and when they pray [[H6419]] to You [[H413]] in the direction [[H1870]] of the city [[H5892]] You have chosen [[H977]] and the house [[H1004]] I have built [[H1129]] for Your Name, [[H8034]]

### 35
may You hear [[H8085]] from heaven [[H4480]] their prayer [[H8605]] and [[H853]] their plea, [[H8467]] and may You uphold [[H6213]] their cause. [[H4941]]

### 36
When [[H3588]] they sin [[H2398]] against You—  for [[H3588]] there is no [[H369]] one [[H120]] who [[H834]] does not [[H3808]] sin— [[H2398]] and You become angry [[H599]] with them  and deliver them [[H5414]] to [[H6440]] an enemy [[H341]] who takes them [[H7617]] as captives [[H7617]] to [[H413]] a land [[H776]] far [[H7350]] or [[H176]] near, [[H7138]]

### 37
and when they come [[H7725]] to [[H413]] their senses [[H3824]] in the land [[H776]] to which [[H834]] they were taken, [[H7617]] and they repent [[H7725]] and plead [[H2603]] with You [[H413]] in the land [[H776]] of their captors, [[H7633]] saying, [[H559]] ‘We have sinned [[H2398]] and done wrong; [[H5753]] we have acted wickedly,’ [[H7561]]

### 38
and when they return [[H7725]] to You [[H413]] with all [[H3605]] their heart [[H3820]] and [[H3605]] soul [[H5315]] in the land [[H776]] of the enemies [[H7633]] who [[H834]] took them captive, [[H7617]] and when they pray [[H6419]] in the direction [[H1870]] of the land [[H776]] that [[H834]] You gave [[H5414]] to their fathers, [[H1]] the city [[H5892]] You have chosen, [[H977]] and the house [[H1004]] I have built [[H1129]] for Your Name, [[H8034]]

### 39
may You hear [[H8085]] from [[H4480]] heaven, [[H8064]] Your dwelling [[H3427]] place, [[H4349]] their prayer [[H8605]] and petition, [[H8467]] and may You uphold [[H6213]] their cause. [[H4941]] May You forgive [[H5545]] Your people [[H5971]] who [[H834]] sinned against You. [[H2398]]

### 40
Now, [[H6258]] my God, [[H430]] may [[H4994]] Your eyes [[H5869]] be [[H1961]] open [[H6605]] and Your ears [[H241]] attentive [[H7183]] to the prayer offered [[H8605]] in this [[H2088]] place. [[H4725]]

### 41
Now therefore, [[H6258]] arise, [[H6965]] O LORD [[H3068]] God, [[H430]] and enter Your resting place, [[H5118]] You [[H859]] and the ark [[H727]] of Your might. [[H5797]] May Your priests, [[H3548]] O LORD [[H3068]] God, [[H430]] be clothed [[H3847]] with salvation, [[H8668]] and may Your godly ones [[H2623]] rejoice [[H8055]] in goodness. [[H2896]]

### 42
O LORD [[H3068]] God, [[H430]] do not [[H408]] reject [[H7725]] Your anointed one. [[H4899]] Remember [[H2142]] [Your] loving devotion [[H2617]] to Your servant [[H5650]] David.” [[H1732]]
