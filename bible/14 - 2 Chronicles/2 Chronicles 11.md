###### 1
When Rehoboam [[H7346]] arrived [[H935]] in Jerusalem, [[H3389]] he mobilized [[H6950]] the house [[H1004]] of Judah [[H3063]] and Benjamin— [[H1144]] 180,000 {} [[H3967]] choice [[H970]] warriors— [[H4421]] to fight [[H3898]] against [[H5973]] Israel [[H3478]] and restore [[H7725]] the kingdom [[H4467]] to Rehoboam. [[H7346]]

###### 2
But the word [[H1697]] of the LORD [[H3069]] came [[H1961]] to [[H413]] Shemaiah [[H8098]] the man [[H376]] of God: [[H430]]

###### 3
“Tell [[H559]] Rehoboam [[H7346]] son [[H1121]] of Solomon [[H8010]] king [[H4428]] of Judah [[H3063]] and [[H413]] all [[H3605]] the Israelites [[H3478]] in Judah [[H3063]] and Benjamin [[H1144]]

###### 4
that this is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] says: [[H559]] ‘You are not [[H3808]] to go up [[H5927]] and fight [[H3898]] against [[H5973]] your brothers. [[H251]] Each [[H376]] of you must return [[H7725]] home, [[H1004]] for [[H3588]] this [[H2088]] word [[H1697]] is [[H1961]] from Me.’” [[H853]] So they listened [[H8085]] to the words [[H1697]] of the LORD [[H3068]] and turned back [[H7725]] from going [[H1980]] against [[H413]] Jeroboam. [[H3379]]

###### 5
Rehoboam [[H7346]] continued to live [[H3427]] in Jerusalem, [[H3389]] and he built up [[H1129]] cities [[H5892]] for defense [[H4692]] in Judah. [[H3063]]

###### 6
He built up [[H1129]] Bethlehem, [[H1035]] Etam, [[H5862]] Tekoa, [[H8620]]

###### 7
Beth-zur, [[H1049]] Soco, [[H7755]] Adullam, [[H5725]]

###### 8
Gath, [[H1661]] Mareshah, [[H4762]] Ziph, [[H2128]]

###### 9
Adoraim, [[H115]] Lachish, [[H3923]] Azekah, [[H5825]]

###### 10
Zorah, [[H6881]] Aijalon, [[H357]] and Hebron, [[H2275]] the fortified [[H4694]] cities [[H5892]] in Judah [[H3063]] and Benjamin. [[H1144]]

###### 11
He strengthened [[H2388]] their fortresses [[H4694]] and put [[H5414]] officers [[H5057]] in them,  with supplies [[H214]] of food, [[H3978]] oil, [[H8081]] and wine. [[H3196]]

###### 12
He also put shields [[H6793]] and spears [[H7420]] in all [[H3605]] the cities [[H5892]] and strengthened [[H2388]] them greatly. [[H7235]] So Judah [[H3063]] and Benjamin [[H1144]] belonged to him. [[H1961]]

###### 13
Moreover, the priests [[H3548]] and Levites [[H3881]] from [[H834]] all [[H3605]] their districts [[H1366]] throughout [[H3605]] Israel [[H3478]] stood [[H3320]] with Rehoboam. [[H5921]]

###### 14
For [[H3588]] the Levites [[H3881]] left [[H5800]] their pasturelands [[H4054]] and their possessions [[H272]] and went [[H1980]] to Judah [[H3063]] and Jerusalem, [[H3389]] because [[H3588]] Jeroboam [[H3379]] and his sons [[H1121]] had rejected them [[H2186]] as priests [[H3547]] of the LORD. [[H3068]]

###### 15
And Jeroboam appointed [[H5975]] his own  priests [[H3548]] for the high places [[H1116]] and for the goat-demons [[H8163]] and calf idols [[H5695]] he had made. [[H6213]]

###### 16
Those from every [[H3605]] tribe [[H7626]] of Israel [[H3478]] who had set [[H5414]] their hearts [[H3824]] to seek [[H1245]] the LORD [[H3068]] their [[H3478]] God [[H430]] followed [the Levites] [[H310]] to Jerusalem [[H3389]] to sacrifice [[H2076]] to the LORD, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of their fathers. [[H1]]

###### 17
So they strengthened [[H2388]] the kingdom [[H4438]] of Judah [[H3063]] and supported [[H553]] Rehoboam [[H7346]] son [[H1121]] of Solomon [[H8010]] for three [[H7969]] years, [[H8141]] because [[H3588]] they walked [[H1980]] for three [[H7969]] years [[H8141]] in the way [[H1870]] of David [[H1732]] and Solomon. [[H8010]]

###### 18
And Rehoboam [[H7346]] married [[H3947]] Mahalath, [[H4258]] [who was] the daughter [[H1121]] of David’s [[H1732]] son [[H1121]] Jerimoth [[H1323]] and of Abihail, [[H32]] the daughter [[H1323]] of Jesse’s [[H3448]] son [[H1121]] Eliab. [[H446]]

###### 19
She bore [[H3205]] sons to him: [[H1121]] Jeush, [[H3266]] Shemariah, [[H8114]] and Zaham. [[H2093]]

###### 20
After her, [[H310]] he married [[H3947]] Maacah [[H4601]] daughter [[H1323]] of Absalom, [[H53]] and she bore [[H3205]] to him  Abijah, [[H29]] Attai, [[H6262]] Ziza, [[H2124]] and Shelomith. [[H8019]]

###### 21
Rehoboam [[H7346]] loved [[H157]] Maacah [[H4601]] daughter [[H1323]] of Absalom [[H53]] more than all [[H3605]] his wives [[H802]] and concubines. [[H6370]] In all, he had [[H5375]] eighteen [[H8083]] wives [[H802]] and sixty [[H8346]] concubines, [[H6370]] and he was the father [[H3205]] of twenty-eight [[H6242]] sons [[H1121]] and sixty [[H8346]] daughters. [[H1323]]

###### 22
Rehoboam [[H7346]] appointed [[H5975]] Abijah [[H29]] son [[H1121]] of Maacah [[H4601]] as chief [[H7218]] prince [[H5057]] among his brothers, [[H251]] intending to make him king. [[H4427]]

###### 23
Rehoboam also acted wisely [[H995]] by dispersing [[H6555]] some of his sons [[H1121]] throughout [[H3605]] the districts [[H776]] of Judah [[H3063]] and Benjamin, [[H1144]] and to all [[H3605]] the fortified [[H4694]] cities. [[H5892]] He gave [[H5414]] them  abundant [[H7230]] provisions [[H4202]] and sought [[H7592]] many [[H1995]] wives for them. [[H802]]
