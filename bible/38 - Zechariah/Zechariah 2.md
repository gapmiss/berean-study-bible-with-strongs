### 1
Then I lifted [[H5375]] up my eyes [[H5869]] and saw [[H7200]] a man [[H376]] with a measuring [[H4060]] line [[H2256]] in his hand. [[H3027]]

### 2
“Where [[H575]] are you [[H859]] going?” [[H1980]] I asked. [[H559]] “To measure [[H4058]] Jerusalem,” [[H3389]] he replied, [[H559]] “and to determine [[H7200]] its width [[H7341]] and length.” [[H753]]

### 3
Then [[H2009]] the angel [[H4397]] who was speaking [[H1696]] with me went out, [[H3318]] and another [[H312]] angel [[H4397]] came out [[H3318]] to meet him [[H7125]]

### 4
and said [[H559]] to him, [[H413]] “Run [[H7323]] and tell [[H1696]] that [[H1975]] young man: [[H5288]] ‘Jerusalem [[H3389]] will be a city [[H3427]] without walls [[H6519]] because of the multitude [[H7230]] of men [[H120]] and livestock [[H929]] within it. [[H8432]]

### 5
For I [[H589]] will be [[H1961]] a wall [[H2346]] of fire [[H784]] around it, [[H5439]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD, [[H3069]] and I will be [[H1961]] the glory [[H3519]] within it.’” [[H8432]]

### 6
“Get up! [[H1945]] Get up! [[H1945]] Flee [[H5127]] from the land [[H776]] of the north,” [[H6828]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD, [[H3068]] “for [[H3588]] I have scattered [[H6566]] you like the four [[H702]] winds [[H7307]] of heaven,” [[H8064]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD. [[H3068]]

### 7
“Get up, [[H1945]] O Zion! [[H6726]] Escape, [[H4422]] you who dwell [[H3427]] with the Daughter [[H1323]] of Babylon.” [[H894]]

### 8
For [[H3588]] this is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts [[H6635]] says: [[H559]] “After His glory [[H3519]] has sent me [[H7971]] against [[H413]] the nations [[H1471]] that have plundered you— [[H7997]] for [[H3588]] whoever touches [[H5060]] you  touches [[H5060]] the apple [[H892]] of His eye— [[H5869]]

### 9
I will surely [[H2005]] wave [[H5130]] My hand [[H3027]] over them, [[H5921]] so that they will become [[H1961]] plunder [[H7998]] for their own servants. [[H5650]] Then you will know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts [[H6635]] has sent Me.” [[H7971]]

### 10
“Shout for joy [[H7442]] and be glad, [[H8055]] O daughter [[H1323]] of Zion, [[H6726]] for [[H3588]] I am coming [[H935]] to dwell [[H7931]] among you,” [[H8432]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD. [[H3068]]

### 11
“On that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] many [[H7227]] nations [[H1471]] will join [[H3867]] themselves to [[H413]] the LORD, [[H3068]] and they will become [[H1961]] My  people. [[H5971]] I will dwell [[H7931]] among you, [[H8432]] and you will know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts [[H6635]] has sent Me [[H7971]] to you. [[H413]]

### 12
And the LORD [[H3068]] will take possession [[H5157]] of Judah [[H3063]] as His portion [[H2506]] in [[H5921]] the Holy [[H6944]] Land, [[H127]] and He will once again [[H5750]] choose [[H977]] Jerusalem. [[H3389]]

### 13
Be silent [[H2013]] before [[H6440]] the LORD, [[H3068]] all [[H3605]] people, [[H1320]] for [[H3588]] He has roused Himself [[H5782]] from His holy [[H6944]] dwelling.” [[H4583]]
