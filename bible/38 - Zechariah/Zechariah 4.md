### 1
Then the angel [[H4397]] who was speaking [[H1696]] with me  returned [[H7725]] and woke me, [[H5782]] as a man [[H376]] is awakened [[H5782]] from his sleep. [[H8142]]

### 2
“What [[H4100]] do you [[H859]] see?” [[H7200]] he asked. [[H559]] “I see [[H7200]] a solid gold [[H2091]] lampstand,” [[H4501]] I replied, [[H559]] “with [[H2009]] a bowl [[H1543]] at [[H5921]] the top [[H7218]] and seven [[H7651]] lamps [[H5216]] on it, [[H5921]] with seven [[H7651]] spouts [[H4166]] to each of the lamps. [[H5216]]

### 3
There are also two [[H8147]] olive trees [[H2132]] beside it, [[H5921]] one [[H259]] on the right [[H3225]] of the bowl [[H1543]] and the other [[H259]] on [[H5921]] its left.” [[H8040]]

### 4
“What [[H4100]] are these, [[H428]] my lord?” [[H113]] I asked [[H6030]] the angel [[H4397]] who was speaking with me. [[H1696]]

### 5
“Do you not [[H3808]] know [[H3045]] what [[H4100]] they are?” [[H1992]] replied [[H6030]] the angel. [[H4397]] “No, [[H3808]] my lord,” [[H113]] I answered. [[H559]]

### 6
So he said to me, [[H6030]] “This [[H2088]] is the word [[H1697]] of the LORD [[H3068]] to [[H413]] Zerubbabel: [[H2216]] Not [[H3808]] by might [[H2428]] nor [[H3808]] by power, [[H3581]] but [[H3588]] by My Spirit, [[H7307]] says [[H559]] the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts. [[H6635]]

### 7
What [[H4310]] are you, [[H859]] O great [[H1419]] mountain? [[H2022]] Before [[H6440]] Zerubbabel [[H2216]] you will become a plain. [[H4334]] Then he will bring forth [[H3318]] the capstone [[H68]] accompanied by shouts of [[H8663]] ‘Grace, [[H2580]] grace [[H2580]] to it!’” 

### 8
Then the word [[H1697]] of the LORD [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] to me: [[H413]]

### 9
“The hands [[H3027]] of Zerubbabel [[H2216]] have laid the foundation [[H3248]] of this [[H2088]] house, [[H1004]] and his hands [[H3027]] will complete it. [[H1214]] Then you will know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts [[H6635]] has sent [[H7971]] me to you. [[H413]]

### 10
For [[H3588]] who [[H4310]] has despised [[H937]] the day [[H3117]] of small things? [[H6996]] But these [[H428]] seven [[H7651]] eyes [[H5869]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] which [[H1992]] scan [[H7751]] the whole [[H3605]] earth, [[H776]] will rejoice [[H8055]] when they see [[H7200]] the plumb line [[H68]] in Zerubbabel’s [[H2216]] hand.” [[H3027]]

### 11
Then I asked [[H6030]] [the angel], [[H413]] “What [[H4100]] are the [[H428]] two [[H8147]] olive trees [[H2132]] on [[H5921]] the right [[H3225]] and left [[H8040]] of the lampstand?” [[H4501]]

### 12
And I questioned [[H6030]] him further, [[H8145]] “What [[H4100]] are the two [[H8147]] olive [[H2132]] branches [[H7641]] beside [[H3027]] the two [[H8147]] gold [[H2091]] pipes [[H6804]] from which [[H5921]] the golden [oil] [[H2091]] pours?” [[H7324]]

### 13
“Do you not [[H3808]] know [[H3045]] what [[H4100]] these are?” [[H428]] he inquired. [[H559]] “No, [[H3808]] my lord,” [[H113]] I replied. [[H559]]

### 14
So he said, [[H559]] “These [[H428]] are the two [[H8147]] anointed [[H3323]] ones [[H1121]] who are standing [[H5975]] beside [[H5921]] the Lord [[H113]] of all [[H3605]] the earth.” [[H776]]
