###### 1
Ask [[H7592]] the LORD [[H3068]] for rain [[H4306]] in springtime; [[H6256]] the LORD [[H3068]] makes [[H6213]] the storm clouds, [[H2385]] and He will give [[H5414]] them [[H1992]] showers [[H1653]] of rain [[H4306]] and crops [[H6212]] of the field [[H7704]] for everyone. [[H376]]

###### 2
For [[H3588]] idols [[H8655]] speak [[H1696]] deceit [[H205]] and diviners [[H7080]] see [[H2372]] illusions; [[H8267]] they tell [[H1696]] FALSE [[H7723]] dreams [[H2472]] and offer empty [[H1892]] comfort. [[H5162]] Therefore [[H5921]] the people wander [[H5265]] like [[H3644]] sheep, [[H6629]] oppressed [[H6031]] for [[H3588]] lack [[H369]] of a shepherd. [[H7462]]

###### 3
“My anger [[H639]] burns [[H2734]] against [[H5921]] the shepherds, [[H7462]] and I will punish [[H6485]] the leaders. [[H6260]] For [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts [[H6635]] attends to [[H6485]] His flock, [[H5739]] the house [[H1004]] of Judah; [[H3063]] He will make [[H7760]] them [[H853]] like His royal [[H1935]] steed [[H5483]] in battle. [[H4421]]

###### 4
The cornerstone [[H6438]] will come from Judah, [[H4480]] the tent peg [[H3489]] from him, [[H4480]] as well as the battle [[H4421]] bow [[H7198]] and every [[H3605]] ruler [[H5065]] together. [[H3162]]

###### 5
They will be [[H1961]] like mighty men [[H1368]] in battle, [[H4421]] trampling [[H947]] [the enemy] in the mire [[H2916]] of the streets. [[H2351]] They will fight [[H3898]] because [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] is with them, [[H5973]] and they will put the horsemen [[H7392]] to shame. [[H3001]]

###### 6
I will strengthen [[H1396]] the house [[H1004]] of Judah [[H3063]] and deliver [[H3467]] the house [[H1004]] of Joseph. [[H3130]] I will restore them [[H7725]] because [[H3588]] I have compassion on them, [[H7355]] and they will be [[H1961]] as though [[H834]] I had not [[H3808]] rejected them. [[H2186]] For [[H3588]] I [[H589]] am the LORD [[H3068]] their God, [[H430]] and I will answer them. [[H6030]]

###### 7
Ephraim [[H669]] will be [[H1961]] like a mighty man, [[H1368]] and their hearts [[H3820]] will be glad [[H8055]] as [[H3644]] with wine. [[H3196]] Their children [[H1121]] will see it [[H7200]] and be glad; [[H8056]] their hearts [[H3820]] will rejoice [[H1523]] in the LORD. [[H3068]]

###### 8
I will whistle [[H8319]] for them  to gather, [[H6908]] for [[H3588]] I have redeemed them; [[H6299]] and they will be as numerous [[H7235]] as [[H3644]] they once were. [[H7235]]

###### 9
Though I sow [[H2232]] them among the nations, [[H5971]] they will remember Me [[H2142]] in distant lands; [[H4801]] they and their children [[H1121]] will live [[H2421]] and return. [[H7725]]

###### 10
I will bring them back [[H7725]] from [[H776]] Egypt [[H4714]] and gather them [[H6908]] from Assyria. [[H804]] I will bring [[H935]] them [[H413]] to Gilead [[H1568]] and Lebanon [[H3844]] until no [[H3808]] [more room] is found [[H4672]] for them. 

###### 11
They will pass [[H5674]] through the sea [[H3220]] of distress [[H6869]] and strike [[H5221]] the waves [[H1530]] of the sea; [[H3220]] all [[H3605]] the depths [[H4688]] of the Nile [[H2975]] will dry up. [[H3001]] The pride [[H1347]] of Assyria [[H804]] will be brought down, [[H3381]] and the scepter [[H7626]] of Egypt [[H4714]] will depart. [[H5493]]

###### 12
I will strengthen [[H1396]] them in the LORD, [[H3068]] and in His name [[H8034]] they will walk,” [[H1980]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD. [[H3068]]
