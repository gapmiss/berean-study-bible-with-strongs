### 1
In the fourth [[H702]] year [[H8141]] of King [[H4428]] Darius, [[H1867]] the word [[H1697]] of the LORD [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] to [[H413]] Zechariah [[H2148]] on the fourth [[H702]] day of the ninth [[H8671]] month, [[H2320]] the month of Chislev. [[H3691]]

### 2
Now the people of Bethel [[H1008]] had sent [[H7971]] Sharezer [[H8272]] and  Regem-melech, [[H7278]] along with their men, [[H582]] to plead [[H2470]] before [[H6440]] the LORD [[H3069]]

### 3
by asking [[H559]] the priests [[H3548]] of the house [[H1004]] of the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts [[H6635]] as well as the prophets, [[H5030]] “Should I weep [[H1058]] and fast [[H5144]] in the fifth [[H2549]] month, [[H2320]] as [[H834]] I have done [[H6213]] these [[H2088]] many [[H4100]] years?” [[H8141]]

### 4
Then the word [[H1697]] of the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts [[H6635]] came [[H1961]] to me, [[H413]] saying, [[H559]]

### 5
“Ask [[H559]] all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] of the land [[H776]] and the priests, [[H3548]] ‘When [[H3588]] you fasted [[H6684]] and mourned [[H5594]] in the fifth [[H2549]] and seventh months [[H7637]] for these [[H2088]] seventy [[H7657]] years, [[H8141]] {was it really} for Me [[H589]] that you fasted? [[H6684]]

### 6
And when [[H3588]] you were eating [[H398]] and drinking, [[H8354]] were you not [[H3808]] [doing so] [[H859]] simply for yourselves? [[H8354]]

### 7
Are these not [[H3808]] the words [[H1697]] that [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] proclaimed [[H7121]] through [[H3027]] the earlier [[H7223]] prophets, [[H5030]] when Jerusalem [[H3389]] and its surrounding [[H5439]] towns [[H5892]] were [[H1961]] populous [[H3427]] and prosperous, [[H7961]] and the Negev [[H5045]] and the Lowland [[H8219]] were inhabited?’” [[H3427]]

### 8
Then the word [[H1697]] of the LORD [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] to [[H413]] Zechariah, [[H2148]] saying, [[H559]]

### 9
“This is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts [[H6635]] says: [[H559]] ‘Administer [[H8199]] TRUE [[H571]] justice. [[H4941]] Show [[H6213]] loving devotion [[H2617]] and compassion [[H7356]] to [[H854]] one [[H376]] another. [[H251]]

### 10
Do not [[H408]] oppress [[H6231]] the widow [[H490]] or the fatherless, [[H3490]] the foreigner [[H1616]] or the poor. [[H6041]] And do not [[H408]] plot [[H2803]] evil [[H7451]] in your hearts [[H3824]] against one [[H376]] another.’ [[H251]]

### 11
But they refused [[H3985]] to pay attention [[H7181]] and turned [[H5414]] a stubborn [[H5637]] shoulder; [[H3802]] they stopped up [[H3513]] their ears [[H241]] from hearing. [[H8085]]

### 12
They made [[H7760]] their hearts [[H3820]] [like] flint [[H8068]] and would not listen to [[H8085]] the law [[H8451]] and [[H853]] the words [[H1697]] that [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts [[H6635]] had sent [[H7971]] by His Spirit [[H7307]] through [[H3027]] the earlier [[H7223]] prophets. [[H5030]] Therefore great [[H1419]] anger [[H7110]] came [[H1961]] from [[H853]] the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts. [[H6635]]

### 13
Therefore [[H1961]] just as [[H834]] I had called [[H7121]] and they would not [[H3808]] listen, [[H8085]] so [[H3651]] when they called [[H7121]] I would not [[H3808]] listen, [[H8085]] says [[H559]] the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts. [[H6635]]

### 14
But I scattered them with a whirlwind [[H5590]] among [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] the nations [[H1471]] that [[H834]] they had not [[H3808]] known, [[H3045]] and the land [[H776]] was left desolate [[H8074]] behind them, [[H310]] so that no one could come [[H5674]] or go. [[H7725]] Thus they turned [[H7760]] a pleasant [[H2532]] land [[H776]] into a desolation.” [[H8047]]
