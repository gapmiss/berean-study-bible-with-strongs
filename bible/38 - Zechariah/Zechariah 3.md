###### 1
Then [the angel] showed me [[H7200]] Joshua [[H3091]] the high [[H1419]] priest [[H3548]] standing [[H5975]] before [[H6440]] the Angel [[H4397]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] with Satan [[H7854]] standing [[H5975]] at [[H5921]] his right hand [[H3225]] to accuse him. [[H7853]]

###### 2
And the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Satan: [[H7854]] “The LORD [[H3068]] rebukes [[H1605]] you,  Satan! [[H7854]] Indeed, the LORD, [[H3068]] who has chosen [[H977]] Jerusalem, [[H3389]] rebukes you! [[H1605]] Is not [[H3808]] this man [[H2088]] a firebrand [[H181]] snatched [[H5337]] from the fire?” [[H784]]

###### 3
Now Joshua [[H3091]] was [[H1961]] dressed [[H3847]] in filthy [[H6674]] garments [[H899]] as he stood [[H5975]] before [[H6440]] the Angel. [[H4397]]

###### 4
So [the Angel of the LORD] [[H6030]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] those standing [[H5975]] before Him, [[H6440]] “Take off [[H5493]] his filthy [[H6674]] clothes!” [[H899]] Then He said [[H559]] to [Joshua], [[H413]] “See, [[H7200]] I have removed [[H5674]] your iniquity, [[H5771]] and I will clothe [[H3847]] you [[H853]] with splendid robes.” [[H4254]]

###### 5
Then I said, [[H559]] “Let them put [[H7760]] a clean [[H2889]] turban [[H6797]] on [[H5921]] his head.” [[H7218]] So a clean [[H2889]] turban [[H6797]] was placed [[H7760]] on [[H5921]] his head, [[H7218]] and they clothed him, [[H3847]] as the Angel [[H4397]] of the LORD [[H3068]] stood by. [[H5975]]

###### 6
Then the Angel [[H4397]] of the LORD [[H3069]] gave this charge [[H5749]] to Joshua: [[H3091]]

###### 7
“This is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts [[H6635]] says: [[H559]] ‘If [[H518]] you walk [[H1980]] in My ways [[H1870]] and keep [[H8104]] My instructions, [[H4931]] then you [[H859]] will both [[H1571]] govern [[H1777]] My house [[H1004]] and [[H1571]] have charge [[H8104]] of [[H853]] My courts; [[H2691]] and I will give [[H5414]] you  a place [[H4108]] among [[H996]] these [[H428]] standing here. [[H5975]]

###### 8
‘Hear [[H8085]] now, [[H4994]] O high [[H1419]] priest [[H3548]] Joshua, [[H3091]] you [[H859]] and your companions [[H7453]] seated [[H3427]] before you, [[H6440]] who are indeed [[H3588]] a sign. [[H4159]] For [[H3588]] behold, [[H2005]] I am going to bring [[H935]] My servant, [[H5650]] the Branch. [[H6780]]

###### 9
See [[H2009]] the stone [[H68]] I have set [[H5414]] before [[H6440]] Joshua; [[H3091]] on [[H5921]] that one [[H259]] stone [[H68]] are seven [[H7651]] eyes. [[H5869]] Behold, [[H2005]] I will engrave on it [[H6605]] an inscription,’ [[H6603]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts, [[H6635]] ‘and I will remove [[H4185]] the iniquity [[H5771]] of this [[H1931]] land [[H776]] in a single [[H259]] day. [[H3117]]

###### 10
On that [[H1931]] day,’ [[H3117]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts, [[H6635]] ‘each [[H376]] of you will invite [[H7121]] his neighbor [[H7453]] to [[H413]] sit under [[H8478]] his vine [[H1612]] and [[H413]] under [[H8478]] his fig tree.’” [[H8384]]
