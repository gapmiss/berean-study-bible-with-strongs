###### 1
And again [[H7725]] I lifted [[H5375]] up my eyes [[H5869]] and saw [[H7200]] four [[H702]] chariots [[H4818]] coming out [[H3318]] from between [[H996]] two [[H8147]] mountains— [[H2022]] mountains [[H2022]] of bronze. [[H5178]]

###### 2
The first [[H7223]] chariot [[H4818]] had red [[H122]] horses, [[H5483]] the second [[H8145]] black [[H7838]] horses, [[H5483]]

###### 3
the third [[H7992]] white [[H3836]] horses, [[H5483]] and the fourth [[H7243]] dappled [[H1261]] horses— [[H5483]] all of them strong. [[H554]]

###### 4
So I inquired [[H559]] of [[H413]] the angel [[H4397]] who was speaking with me, [[H1696]] “What [[H4100]] are these, [[H428]] my lord?” [[H113]]

###### 5
And [[H6030]] the angel [[H4397]] told [[H559]] me, [[H413]] “These [[H428]] are the four [[H702]] spirits [[H7307]] of heaven, [[H8064]] going out [[H3318]] from [their] station [[H3320]] before [[H5921]] the Lord [[H113]] of all [[H3605]] the earth. [[H776]]

###### 6
The one [[H834]] with  the black [[H7838]] horses [[H5483]] is going [[H3318]] toward [[H413]] the land [[H776]] of the north, [[H6828]] [the one with] the white [horses] [[H3836]] toward [[H413]] [the west], [[H310]] and [the one with] the dappled [horses] [[H1261]] toward [[H413]] the south.” [[H8486]]

###### 7
As the strong [horses] [[H554]] went out, [[H3318]] they were eager [[H1245]] to go [[H1980]] [and] patrol [[H1980]] the earth; [[H776]] and the LORD said, [[H559]] “Go, [[H1980]] patrol [[H1980]] the earth.” [[H776]] So they patrolled [[H1980]] the earth. [[H776]]

###### 8
Then [the LORD] summoned [[H2199]] me [[H854]] and said, [[H559]] “Behold, [[H7200]] those going [[H3318]] to [[H413]] the land [[H776]] of the north [[H6828]] have given rest [[H5117]] to My Spirit [[H7307]] in the land [[H776]] of the north.” [[H6828]]

###### 9
The word [[H1697]] of the LORD [[H3068]] also came [[H1961]] to me, [[H413]] saying, [[H559]]

###### 10
“Take [[H3947]] an offering from [[H853]] the exiles— [[H1473]] from Heldai, [[H2469]] Tobijah, [[H2900]] and Jedaiah, [[H3048]] who [[H834]] have arrived [[H935]] from Babylon— [[H894]] and go [[H935]] that same [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] to the house [[H1004]] of Josiah [[H2977]] son [[H1121]] of Zephaniah. [[H6846]]

###### 11
Take [[H3947]] silver [[H3701]] and gold, [[H2091]] make [[H6213]] an [ornate] crown, [[H5850]] and set [[H7760]] [it] on the head [[H7218]] of the high [[H1419]] priest, [[H3548]] Joshua [[H3091]] son [[H1121]] of Jehozadak. [[H3087]]

###### 12
And you are to tell him [[H559]] that this is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts [[H6635]] says: [[H559]] ‘Behold, [[H2009]] a man [[H376]] whose name [is] [[H8034]] the Branch, [[H6780]] and He will branch out [[H6779]] from His place [[H8478]] and build [[H1129]] the temple [[H1964]] of the LORD. [[H3068]]

###### 13
Yes, He [[H1931]] will build [[H1129]] the temple [[H1964]] of the LORD; [[H3068]] He [[H1931]] will be clothed in [[H5375]] splendor [[H1935]] and will sit [[H3427]] on [[H5921]] His throne [[H3678]] and rule. [[H4910]] There will also be [[H1961]] a priest [[H3548]] on [[H5921]] His throne, [[H3678]] and the counsel [[H6098]] of peace [[H7965]] will be [[H1961]] between [[H996]] the two of them. [[H8147]]

###### 14
The crown [[H5850]] will reside [[H1961]] in the temple [[H1964]] of the LORD [[H3068]] as a memorial [[H2146]] to Heldai, [[H2494]] Tobijah, [[H2900]] Jedaiah, [[H3048]] and Hen [[H2581]] son [[H1121]] of Zephaniah. [[H6846]]

###### 15
Even those far away [[H7350]] will come [[H935]] and build [[H1129]] the temple [[H1964]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] and you will know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts [[H6635]] has sent Me [[H7971]] to you. [[H413]] This will happen [[H1961]] if [[H518]] you diligently [[H8085]] obey [[H8085]] the voice [[H6963]] of the LORD [[H3068]] your God.” [[H430]]
