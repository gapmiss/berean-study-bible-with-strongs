###### 1
On that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] a fountain [[H4726]] will be [[H1961]] opened [[H6605]] to the house [[H1004]] of David [[H1732]] and the residents [[H3427]] of Jerusalem, [[H3389]] to cleanse them from sin [[H2403]] and impurity. [[H5079]]

###### 2
And [[H1961]] on that [[H1931]] day, [[H3117]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts, [[H6635]] I will erase [[H3772]] the names [[H8034]] of the idols [[H6091]] from [[H4480]] the land, [[H776]] and they will no [[H3808]] longer [[H5750]] be remembered. [[H2142]] I will also remove [[H5674]] the prophets [[H5030]] and the unclean [[H2932]] spirit [[H7307]] from [[H4480]] the land. [[H776]]

###### 3
And [[H1961]] if [[H3588]] anyone [[H376]] still [[H5750]] prophesies, [[H5012]] his father [[H1]] and mother [[H517]] who bore him [[H3205]] will say [[H559]] to him, [[H413]] ‘You shall not [[H3808]] remain alive, [[H2421]] because [[H3588]] you have spoken [[H1696]] falsely [[H8267]] in the name [[H8034]] of the LORD.’ [[H3068]] When he prophesies, [[H5012]] his father [[H1]] and mother [[H517]] who bore him [[H3205]] will pierce him through. [[H1856]]

###### 4
And [[H1961]] on that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] every [[H376]] prophet [[H5030]] who prophesies [[H5012]] will be ashamed [[H954]] of his vision, [[H2384]] and he will not [[H3808]] put on [[H3847]] a hairy [[H8181]] cloak [[H155]] in order to [[H4616]] deceive. [[H3584]]

###### 5
He will say, [[H559]] ‘I [[H595]] am not [[H3808]] a prophet; [[H5030]] I [[H595]] work [[H5647]] the land, [[H127]] for [[H3588]] I was purchased as a servant [[H7069]] in my youth. [[H5271]]

###### 6
If someone asks [[H559]] him, [[H413]] ‘What [[H4100]] are these [[H428]] wounds [[H4347]] on your chest?’ [[H996]] he will answer, [[H559]] ‘These are [[H834]] the wounds I received [[H5221]] in the house [[H1004]] of my friends.’ [[H157]]

###### 7
Awake, [[H5782]] O sword, [[H2719]] against [[H5921]] My shepherd, [[H7473]] against [[H5921]] the man [[H1397]] who is My Companion,” [[H5997]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD [[H3069]] of Hosts. [[H6635]] “Strike [[H5221]] the shepherd, [[H7462]] and the sheep [[H6629]] will be scattered, [[H6327]] and I will turn [[H7725]] My hand [[H3027]] against [[H5921]] the little ones. [[H6819]]

###### 8
And [[H1961]] in all [[H3605]] the land,” [[H776]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD, [[H3068]] “two-thirds [[H6310]] will be cut off [[H3772]] [and] perish, [[H1478]] but a third [[H7992]] will be left [[H3498]] in it. 

###### 9
This third [[H7992]] I will bring [[H935]] through the fire; [[H784]] I will refine them [[H6884]] like silver [[H3701]] and test them [[H974]] like gold. [[H2091]] They will call [[H7121]] on My name, [[H8034]] and I [[H589]] will answer them. [[H6030]] I will say, [[H559]] ‘They [[H1931]] are My people,’ [[H5971]] and they [[H1931]] will say, [[H559]] ‘The LORD [is] [[H3068]] our God.’” [[H430]]
