### 1
Again the word [[H1697]] of the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts [[H6635]] came [to me], [[H1961]] saying: [[H559]]

### 2
This is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts [[H6635]] says: [[H559]] “I am jealous [[H7065]] for Zion [[H6726]] with great [[H1419]] zeal; [[H7068]] I am jealous [[H7065]] for her  with great [[H1419]] fervor.” [[H2534]]

### 3
This is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] says: [[H559]] “I will return [[H7725]] to [[H413]] Zion [[H6726]] and dwell [[H7931]] in [[H8432]] Jerusalem. [[H3389]] Then Jerusalem [[H3389]] will be called [[H7121]] the City [[H5892]] of Truth, [[H571]] and the mountain [[H2022]] of the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts [[H6635]] [will be called] the Holy [[H6944]] Mountain.” [[H2022]]

### 4
This is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts [[H6635]] says: [[H559]] “Old men [[H2205]] and old women [[H2205]] will again [[H5750]] sit [[H3427]] along the streets [[H7339]] of Jerusalem, [[H3389]] each [[H376]] with a staff [[H4938]] in hand [[H3027]] because of [[H7230]] great age. [[H3117]]

### 5
And the streets [[H7339]] of the city [[H5892]] will be filled [[H4390]] with boys [[H3206]] and girls [[H3207]] playing [[H7832]] there.” [[H7339]]

### 6
This is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3069]] of Hosts [[H6635]] says: [[H559]] “If [[H3588]] it is marvelous [[H6381]] in the eyes [[H5869]] of the remnant [[H7611]] of this [[H2088]] people [[H5971]] in those [[H1992]] days, [[H3117]] should it also [[H1571]] be marvelous [[H6381]] in My eyes?” [[H5869]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD [[H3069]] of Hosts. [[H6635]]

### 7
This is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts [[H6635]] says: [[H559]] “I will save [[H3467]] My people [[H5971]] from the land [[H776]] of the east [[H4217]] and the land [[H776]] of the west. [[H3996]]

### 8
I will bring [[H935]] them back to live [[H7931]] in [[H8432]] Jerusalem, [[H3389]] where they will be [[H1961]] My  people, [[H5971]] and I [[H589]] will be [[H1961]] their  faithful [[H571]] and righteous [[H6666]] God.” [[H430]]

### 9
This is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts [[H6635]] says: [[H559]] “Let your hands [[H3027]] be strong, [[H2388]] you who now [[H3117]] hear [[H8085]] these [[H428]] words [[H1697]] spoken [[H834]] by the prophets [[H5030]] [who were present] when [[H3117]] the foundations were laid [[H3245]] to rebuild [[H1129]] the temple, [[H1964]] the house [[H1004]] of the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts. [[H6635]]

### 10
For [[H3588]] before [[H6440]] those [[H1992]] days [[H3117]] neither [[H3808]] man [[H120]] nor [[H369]] beast [[H929]] received [[H1961]] wages, [[H7939]] nor was there [[H369]] safety [[H7965]] from [[H4480]] the enemy [[H6862]] for anyone who came [[H3318]] or went, [[H935]] for I had turned [[H7971]] every [[H3605]] man [[H120]] against his neighbor. [[H7453]]

### 11
But now [[H6258]] I [[H589]] will not treat [[H3808]] the remnant [[H7611]] of this [[H2088]] people [[H5971]] as I did in the past,” [[H7223]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts. [[H6635]]

### 12
“For [[H3588]] the seed [[H2233]] [will be] prosperous, [[H7965]] the vine [[H1612]] will yield [[H5414]] its fruit, [[H6529]] the ground [[H776]] will yield [[H5414]] its produce, [[H2981]] and the skies [[H8064]] will give [[H5414]] their dew. [[H2919]] To the remnant [[H7611]] of this [[H2088]] people [[H5971]] {I will give} all [[H3605]] these things [[H428]] as an inheritance. [[H5157]]

### 13
As [[H834]] you have been [[H1961]] a curse [[H7045]] among the nations, [[H1471]] O house [[H1004]] of Judah [[H3063]] and house [[H1004]] of Israel, [[H3478]] so [[H3651]] I will save [[H3467]] you, [[H853]] and you will be [[H1961]] a blessing. [[H1293]] Do not [[H408]] be afraid; [[H3372]] let your hands [[H3027]] be strong.” [[H2388]]

### 14
For [[H3588]] this is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts [[H6635]] says: [[H559]] “Just as [[H834]] I resolved [[H2161]] to bring disaster [[H7489]] upon you  when your fathers [[H1]] provoked Me to anger, [[H7107]] and I did not [[H3808]] relent,” [[H5162]] says [[H559]] the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts, [[H6635]]

### 15
“so [[H3651]] now [[H428]] I have resolved [[H2161]] to do good [[H3190]] again [[H7725]] to Jerusalem [[H3389]] and [[H853]] Judah. [[H3063]] Do not [[H408]] be afraid. [[H3372]]

### 16
These [[H428]] are the things [[H1697]] you must do: [[H6213]] Speak [[H1696]] truth [[H571]] to one [[H376]] another, [[H7453]] render true [[H571]] and sound [[H7965]] decisions [[H4941]] in your gates, [[H8179]]

### 17
do not [[H408]] plot [[H2803]] evil [[H7451]] in your hearts [[H3824]] against your neighbor, [[H7453]] and do not [[H408]] love [[H157]] perjury, [[H7621]] for [[H3588]] I hate [[H8130]] all [[H3605]] these things,” [[H428]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD. [[H3068]]

### 18
Then the word [[H1697]] of the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts [[H6635]] came [[H1961]] to me, [[H413]] saying, [[H559]]

### 19
“This is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts [[H6635]] says: [[H559]] The fasts [[H6685]] of the fourth, [[H7243]] the fifth, [[H2549]] the seventh, [[H7637]] and [[H6685]] the tenth [months] [[H6224]] will become [[H1961]] times of joy [[H8342]] and gladness, [[H8057]] cheerful [[H2896]] feasts [[H4150]] for the house [[H1004]] of Judah. [[H3063]] Therefore love [[H157]] truth [[H571]] and peace. [[H7965]]

### 20
This is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts [[H6635]] says: [[H559]] “Peoples [[H5971]] will yet [[H5750]] come— [[H935]] the residents [[H3427]] of many [[H7227]] cities— [[H5892]]

### 21
and the residents [[H3427]] of one [[H259]] city will go [[H1980]] to [[H413]] another, [[H259]] saying: [[H559]] ‘Let us go [[H1980]] at once to plead [[H2470]] before [[H6440]] the LORD [[H3068]] and to seek [[H1245]] the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts. [[H6635]] I [[H589]] myself [[H1571]] am going.’ [[H1980]]

### 22
And many [[H7227]] peoples [[H5971]] and strong [[H6099]] nations [[H1471]] will come [[H935]] to seek [[H1245]] the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts [[H6635]] in Jerusalem [[H3389]] and to plead [[H2470]] before [[H6440]] the LORD.” [[H3068]]

### 23
This is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts [[H6635]] says: [[H559]] “In those [[H1992]] days [[H3117]] ten [[H6235]] men [[H376]] from all nations [[H1471]] [and] [[H3605]] languages [[H3956]] will tightly [[H2388]] grasp [[H2388]] the robe [[H3671]] of a Jewish [[H3064]] man, [[H376]] saying, [[H559]] ‘Let us go [[H1980]] with you, [[H5973]] for [[H3588]] we have heard [[H8085]] that God [[H430]] is with you. [[H5973]]
