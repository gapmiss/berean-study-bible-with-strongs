###### 1
Open [[H6605]] your doors, [[H1817]] O Lebanon, [[H3844]] that the fire [[H784]] may consume [[H398]] your cedars. [[H730]]

###### 2
Wail, [[H3213]] O cypress, [[H1265]] for [[H3588]] the cedar [[H730]] has fallen; [[H5307]] the majestic [trees] [[H117]] are ruined! [[H7703]] Wail, [[H3213]] O oaks [[H437]] of Bashan, [[H1316]] for [[H3588]] the dense [[H1219]] forest [[H3293]] has been cut down! [[H3381]]

###### 3
Listen to [[H6963]] the wail [[H3215]] of the shepherds, [[H7462]] for [[H3588]] their glory [[H155]] is in ruins. [[H7703]] Listen to the howl [[H7581]] of the young lions, [[H3715]] for [[H3588]] the thickets [[H1347]] of the Jordan [[H3383]] are destroyed. [[H7703]]

###### 4
This is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] my God [[H430]] says: [[H559]] “Pasture [[H7462]] the flock [[H6629]] [marked] for slaughter, [[H2028]]

###### 5
whose [[H834]] buyers [[H7069]] slaughter them [[H2026]] without [[H3808]] remorse. [[H816]] Those who sell them [[H4376]] say, [[H559]] ‘Praise [[H1288]] the LORD, [[H3068]] for I am rich!’ [[H6238]] Even their own shepherds [[H7462]] have no [[H3808]] compassion [[H2550]] for them. [[H5921]]

###### 6
For [[H3588]] I will no [[H3808]] longer [[H5750]] have compassion [[H2550]] on [[H5921]] the people [[H3427]] of the land,” [[H776]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD, [[H3068]] “but behold, [[H2009]] I [[H595]] will cause each [[H376]] man [[H120]] to fall [[H4672]] into the hand [[H3027]] of his neighbor [[H7453]] and [[H3027]] of his king, [[H4428]] who will devastate [[H3807]] the land, [[H776]] and I will not [[H3808]] deliver it [[H5337]] from their hands.” [[H3027]]

###### 7
So I pastured [[H7462]] the flock [[H6629]] marked for slaughter, [[H2028]] especially [[H3651]] the afflicted [[H6041]] of the flock. [[H6629]] Then I took [[H3947]] for myself  two [[H8147]] staffs, [[H4731]] calling [[H7121]] one [[H259]] Favor [[H5278]] and the other [[H259]] Union, [[H2256]] and I pastured [[H7462]] the flock. [[H6629]]

###### 8
And in one [[H259]] month [[H3391]] I dismissed [[H3582]] three [[H7969]] shepherds. [[H7462]] My soul [[H5315]] grew impatient [[H7114]] with [the flock],  and their souls [[H5315]] also [[H1571]] detested [[H973]] me. 

###### 9
Then I said, [[H559]] “I will no longer [[H3808]] shepherd you. [[H7462]] Let the dying [[H4191]] die, [[H4191]] and the perishing [[H3582]] perish; [[H3582]] let the rest [[H7604]] devour [[H398]] one [[H802]] another's [[H7468]] flesh.” [[H1320]]

###### 10
Next I took [[H3947]] my staff [[H4731]] called Favor [[H5278]] and cut it in two, [[H1438]] revoking [[H6565]] the covenant [[H1285]] I had made [[H3772]] with [[H854]] all [[H3605]] the nations. [[H5971]]

###### 11
It was revoked [[H6565]] on that [[H1931]] day, [[H3117]] and so [[H3651]] the afflicted [[H6041]] of the flock [[H6629]] who were watching [[H8104]] me knew [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] it [[H1931]] was the word [[H1697]] of the LORD. [[H3068]]

###### 12
Then I told [[H559]] them, [[H413]] “If [[H518]] it seems [[H5869]] right to you, [[H2896]] give [[H3051]] me my wages; [[H7939]] but if [[H518]] not, [[H3808]] keep them.” [[H2308]] So they weighed out [[H8254]] my wages, [[H7939]] thirty [[H7970]] [pieces] of silver. [[H3701]]

###### 13
And the LORD [[H3069]] said [[H559]] to me, [[H413]] “Throw [[H7993]] it to [[H413]] the potter,” [[H3335]] this magnificent [[H145]] price [[H3366]] at which [[H834]] they valued me. [[H3365]] So I took [[H3947]] the thirty [[H7970]] pieces of silver [[H3701]] and threw [[H7993]] them [[H853]] to [[H413]] the potter [[H3335]] in the house [[H1004]] of the LORD. [[H3069]]

###### 14
Then I cut in pieces [[H1438]] my second [[H8145]] staff [[H4731]] [called] Union, [[H2256]] breaking [[H6565]] the brotherhood [[H264]] between [[H996]] Judah [[H3063]] and Israel. [[H3478]]

###### 15
And the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H559]] to me: [[H413]] “Take up [[H3947]] once more [[H5750]] the equipment [[H3627]] of a foolish [[H196]] shepherd. [[H7462]]

###### 16
For [[H3588]] behold, [[H2009]] I [[H595]] will raise up [[H6965]] a shepherd [[H7462]] in the land [[H776]] who will neither [[H3808]] care for [[H6485]] the lost, [[H3582]] nor [[H3808]] seek [[H1245]] the young, [[H5288]] nor heal [[H7495]] the broken, [[H7665]] nor [[H3808]] sustain [[H3557]] the healthy, [[H5324]] but he will devour [[H398]] the flesh [[H1320]] of the choice [sheep] [[H1277]] and tear off [[H6561]] their hooves. [[H6541]]

###### 17
“Woe [[H1945]] to the worthless [[H457]] shepherd, [[H7473]] who deserts [[H5800]] the flock! [[H6629]] May a sword [[H2719]] strike his arm [[H2220]] and his right [[H3225]] eye! [[H5869]] May his arm [[H2220]] be completely [[H3001]] withered [[H3001]] and his right [[H3225]] eye [[H5869]] utterly blinded!” [[H3543]]
