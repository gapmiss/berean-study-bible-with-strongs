### 1
Meanwhile Boaz [[H1162]] went [[H5927]] to the gate [[H8179]] and sat down [[H3427]] there. [[H8033]] Soon [[H2009]] the kinsman-redeemer [[H1350]] of whom [he] [[H1162]] had spoken [[H1696]] came along, [[H5674]] and Boaz said, [[H559]] “Come over [[H5493]] here, [[H6311]] my friend, [[H6423]] and sit down.” [[H3427]] So he went over [[H5493]] and sat down. [[H3427]]

### 2
Then Boaz took [[H3947]] ten [[H6235]] of the elders [[H2205]] of the city [[H5892]] and said, [[H559]] “Sit [[H3427]] here,” [[H6311]] and they did so. [[H3427]]

### 3
And he said [[H559]] to the kinsman-redeemer, [[H1350]] “Naomi, [[H5281]] who has returned [[H7725]] from the land [[H7704]] of Moab, [[H4124]] is selling [[H4376]] a piece [[H2513]] of land [[H7704]] that [[H834]] belonged to our brother [[H251]] Elimelech. [[H458]]

### 4
I [[H589]] thought [[H559]] I should inform [[H1540]] you [[H241]] that you may buy it back [[H7069]] in the presence of [[H5048]] those seated here [[H3427]] and in the presence of [[H5048]] the elders [[H2205]] of my people. [[H5971]] If [[H518]] you want to redeem it, [[H1350]] do so. [[H1350]] But if you [[H518]] will not [[H3808]] redeem [it], [[H1350]] tell [[H5046]] me  so I may know, [[H3045]] because [[H3588]] [there is] no one [[H369]] but you [[H2108]] to redeem [it], [[H1350]] and I [am] [[H595]] next after you. [[H310]] I [[H595]] will redeem [it], [[H1350]] he replied. [[H559]]

### 5
Then Boaz [[H1162]] said, [[H559]] “On the day [[H3117]] you buy [[H7069]] the land [[H7704]] from [[H3027]] Naomi [[H5281]] and also from [[H854]] Ruth [[H7327]] the Moabitess, [[H4125]] you must also acquire [[H7069]] the widow [[H802]] of the deceased [[H4191]] in order to raise [[H6965]] up the name [[H8034]] of the deceased [[H4191]] on [[H5921]] his inheritance.” [[H5159]]

### 6
The kinsman-redeemer [[H1350]] replied, [[H559]] “I cannot [[H3808]] redeem it myself, [[H1350]] or [[H6435]] I would jeopardize [[H7843]] my own inheritance. [[H5159]] Take my right of redemption, [[H1353]] because [[H3588]] I cannot [[H3808]] redeem it.” [[H1350]]

### 7
(Now [[H2063]] in former times [[H6440]] in Israel, [[H3478]] concerning [[H5921]] the redemption [[H1353]] or exchange of property, [[H8545]] to make any [[H3605]] matter [[H1697]] legally binding [[H6965]] a man [[H376]] would remove [[H8025]] his sandal [[H5275]] and give it [[H5414]] to the other party, [[H7453]] and this [was] [[H2063]] a confirmation [[H8584]] in Israel.) [[H3478]]

### 8
So the kinsman-redeemer [[H1350]] removed [[H8025]] his sandal [[H5275]] and said [[H559]] to Boaz, [[H1162]] “Buy [it] [[H7069]] for yourself.” 

### 9
At this, Boaz [[H1162]] said [[H559]] to the elders [[H2205]] and all [[H3605]] the people, [[H5971]] “You [[H859]] are witnesses [[H5707]] today [[H3117]] that [[H3588]] I am buying [[H7069]] from [[H3027]] Naomi [[H5281]] all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] belonged to Elimelech, [[H458]] Chilion, [[H3630]] and Mahlon. [[H4248]]

### 10
Moreover, [[H1571]] I have acquired [[H7069]] Ruth [[H7327]] the Moabitess, [[H4125]] Mahlon’s [[H4248]] widow, [[H802]] as my wife, [[H802]] to raise up [[H6965]] the name [[H8034]] of the deceased [[H4191]] through [[H5921]] his inheritance, [[H5159]] so that his [[H4191]] name [[H8034]] will not [[H3808]] disappear [[H3772]] from among [[H5973]] his brothers [[H251]] or from the gate [[H8179]] of his home. [[H4725]] You [[H859]] are witnesses today. [[H5707]]

### 11
“We are witnesses,” [[H5707]] said [[H559]] the elders [[H2205]] and all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] at the gate. [[H8179]] “May the LORD [[H3068]] make [[H5414]] the woman [[H802]] entering [[H935]] your home [[H1004]] like Rachel [[H7354]] and Leah, [[H3812]] who [[H834]] together built up [[H1129]] the house [[H1004]] of Israel. [[H3478]] May you be [[H6213]] prosperous [[H2428]] in Ephrathah [[H672]] and famous [[H7121]] in  Bethlehem. [[H1035]]

### 12
And may your house [[H1004]] become [[H1961]] like the house [[H1004]] of Perez, [[H6557]] whom [[H834]] Tamar [[H8559]] bore [[H3205]] to Judah, [[H3063]] because of [[H4480]] the offspring [[H2233]] the LORD [[H3068]] will give [[H5414]] you  by [[H4480]] this [[H2063]] young woman.” [[H5291]]

### 13
So Boaz [[H1162]] took [[H3947]] Ruth [[H7327]] and she became [[H1961]] his wife. [[H802]] And he had relations with [[H935]] her, [[H413]] the LORD [[H3068]] enabled [[H5414]] her  to conceive, [[H2032]] and she gave birth to [[H3205]] a son. [[H1121]]

### 14
Then the women [[H802]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Naomi, [[H5281]] “Blessed [be] [[H1288]] the LORD, [[H3068]] who [[H834]] has not [[H3808]] left [[H7673]] you  this day [[H3117]] without a kinsman-redeemer. [[H1350]] May his name [[H8034]] become famous [[H7121]] in Israel. [[H3478]]

### 15
He will renew [[H1961]] your life [[H5315]] and sustain you [[H3557]] in your old age. [[H7872]] For [[H3588]] your daughter-in-law, [[H3618]] who [[H834]] loves [[H157]] you and is better [[H2896]] to you than  seven [[H7651]] sons, [[H1121]] has given him birth.” [[H3205]]

### 16
And Naomi [[H5281]] took [[H3947]] the child, [[H3206]] placed [[H7896]] him on her lap, [[H2436]] and became [[H1961]] a nurse [[H539]] to him. 

### 17
The neighbor [[H7934]] women said, [[H559]] “A son [[H1121]] has been born [[H3205]] to Naomi,” [[H5281]] and they named [[H7121]] him  Obed. [[H5744]] He [became] [[H1931]] the father [[H1]] of Jesse, [[H3448]] the father [[H1]] of David. [[H1732]]

### 18
Now these [are] [[H428]] the generations [[H8435]] of Perez: [[H6557]] Perez [[H6557]] was the father of [[H3205]] Hezron, [[H2696]]

### 19
Hezron [[H2696]] was the father of [[H3205]] Ram, [[H7410]] Ram [[H7410]] was the father of [[H3205]] Amminadab, [[H5992]]

### 20
Amminadab [[H5992]] was the father of [[H3205]] Nahshon, [[H5177]] Nahshon [[H5177]] was the father of [[H3205]] Salmon, [[H8009]]

### 21
Salmon [[H8012]] was the father of [[H3205]] Boaz, [[H1162]] Boaz [[H1162]] was the father of [[H3205]] Obed, [[H5744]]

### 22
Obed [[H5744]] was the father of [[H3205]] Jesse, [[H3448]] and Jesse [[H3448]] was the father of [[H3205]] David. [[H1732]]
