### 1
One day Ruth’s mother-in-law [[H2545]] Naomi [[H5281]] said to her, [[H559]] “My daughter, [[H1323]] should I not [[H3808]] seek [[H1245]] a place [[H4494]] for you,  that [[H834]] it may be well [[H3190]] with you? 

### 2
Now [[H6258]] is not [[H3808]] Boaz, [[H1162]] with whose [[H834]] servant girls [[H5291]] you have been [working], [[H1961]] a relative of ours? [[H4130]] In fact, [[H2009]] tonight [[H3915]] he [[H1931]] is winnowing [[H2219]] barley [[H8184]] on the threshing floor. [[H1637]]

### 3
Therefore wash yourself, [[H7364]] put on perfume, [[H5480]] and wear [[H7760]] your best clothes. [[H8071]] Go down [[H3381]] to the threshing floor, [[H1637]] but do not [[H408]] let the man [[H376]] know [[H3045]] you are there until [[H5704]] he has finished [[H3615]] eating [[H398]] and drinking. [[H8354]]

### 4
When he lies down, [[H7901]] note [[H3045]] the place [[H4725]] where [[H834]] he lies. [[H7901]] Then go in [[H935]] and uncover [[H1540]] his feet, [[H4772]] and lie down, [[H7901]] and he [[H1931]] will explain [[H5046]] to you what [[H834]] you should do.” [[H6213]]

### 5
“I will do [[H6213]] everything [[H3605]] you say,” [[H559]] Ruth answered. [[H559]]

### 6
So she went down [[H3381]] to the threshing floor [[H1637]] and did [[H6213]] everything [[H3605]] her mother-in-law [[H2545]] had instructed her. [[H6680]]

### 7
After Boaz [[H1162]] had finished eating [[H398]] and drinking [[H8354]] and was in good spirits, [[H3190]] he went [[H935]] to lie down [[H7901]] at the end [[H7097]] of the heap of grain. [[H6194]] Then [Ruth] went in secretly, [[H935]] uncovered [[H1540]] his feet, [[H4772]] and lay down. [[H7901]]

### 8
At midnight, [[H2677]] Boaz [[H376]] was startled, [[H2729]] turned over, [[H3943]] and there [[H2009]] lying [[H7901]] at his feet [[H4772]] was a woman! [[H802]]

### 9
“Who [[H4310]] are you?” [[H859]] he asked. [[H559]] “I [am] [[H595]] your servant [[H519]] Ruth,” [[H7327]] she replied. [[H559]] “Spread [[H6566]] the corner of your garment [[H3671]] over [[H5921]] me, [[H519]] for [[H3588]] you [[H859]] are a kinsman-redeemer.” [[H1350]]

### 10
Then [Boaz] said, [[H559]] “May the LORD [[H3069]] bless [[H1288]] you, [[H859]] my daughter. [[H1323]] You have shown [[H3190]] more kindness [[H2617]] now [[H314]] than [[H4480]] before, [[H7223]] because you have not [[H1115]] run [[H1980]] after [[H310]] the younger men, [[H970]] whether [[H518]] rich [[H6223]] or [[H518]] poor. [[H1800]]

### 11
And now [[H6258]] do not [[H408]] be afraid, [[H3372]] my daughter. [[H1323]] I will do [[H6213]] for you  whatever [[H3605]] you request, [[H559]] since [[H3588]] all [[H3605]] my fellow townspeople [[H5971]] know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] you [[H859]] are a woman [[H802]] of noble character. [[H2428]]

### 12
Yes, [[H3588]] it is true [[H551]] that [[H3588]] I [am] [[H595]] a kinsman-redeemer, [[H1350]] but [[H1571]] there is [[H3426]] a redeemer [[H1350]] nearer [[H7138]] than I. [[H4480]]

### 13
Stay here tonight, [[H3885]] and in the morning, [[H1242]] if [[H518]] he wants to redeem you, [[H1350]] good. [[H2896]] Let him redeem you. [[H1350]] But if [[H518]] he does not [[H3808]] want [[H2654]] to redeem you, [[H1350]] as surely as the LORD [[H3068]] lives, [[H2416]] I [[H595]] will. [[H1350]] Now lie here [[H7901]] until [[H5704]] morning.” [[H1242]]

### 14
So she lay down [[H7901]] at his feet [[H4772]] until [[H5704]] morning, [[H1242]] but she got up [[H6965]] before [[H2958]] anyone [[H376]] else [[H7453]] could recognize her. [[H5234]] Then Boaz said, [[H559]] “Do not [[H408]] let it be known [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] a woman [[H802]] came [[H935]] to the threshing floor.” [[H1637]]

### 15
And he told her, [[H559]] “Bring [[H3051]] the shawl [[H4304]] you are wearing [[H5921]] and hold it out.” [[H270]] When she [did so], [[H270]] he shoveled [[H4058]] six measures [[H8337]] of barley [[H8184]] into her shawl. [[H5921]] Then he went [[H935]] into the city. [[H5892]]

### 16
When Ruth returned [[H935]] to [[H413]] her mother-in-law, [[H2545]] Naomi asked her, [[H559]] “How did it go, [[H4310]] my daughter?” [[H1323]] Then Ruth told [[H5046]] her  all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] [Boaz] [[H376]] had done [[H6213]] for her. 

### 17
And she said, [[H559]] “He gave [[H5414]] me these [[H428]] six [[H8337]] measures of barley, [[H8184]] for [[H3588]] he said, [[H559]] ‘Do not [[H408]] go back [[H935]] to [[H413]] your mother-in-law [[H2545]] empty-handed.’” [[H7387]]

### 18
“Wait, [[H3427]] my daughter,” [[H1323]] said Naomi, [[H559]] “until [[H5704]] you find out [[H3045]] how [[H349]] things [[H1697]] go, [[H5307]] for [[H3588]] he [[H376]] will not [[H3808]] rest [[H8252]] unless [[H3588]] he has resolved [[H3615]] the matter [[H1697]] today.” [[H3117]]
