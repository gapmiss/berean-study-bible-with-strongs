### 1
In the days [[H3117]] when the judges [[H8199]] ruled, [[H8199]] there was [[H1961]] a famine [[H7458]] in the land. [[H776]] And a certain man [[H376]] from  Bethlehem [[H1035]] in Judah, [[H3063]] with his wife [[H802]] and two [[H8147]] sons, [[H1121]] went [[H1980]] to reside [[H1481]] in the land [[H7704]] of Moab. [[H4124]]

### 2
The man’s [[H376]] name [[H8034]] was Elimelech, [[H458]] his wife’s [[H802]] name [[H8034]] was Naomi, [[H5281]] and the names [[H8034]] of his two [[H8147]] sons [[H1121]] were Mahlon [[H4248]] and Chilion. [[H3630]] They were Ephrathites [[H673]] from  Bethlehem [[H1035]] in Judah, [[H3063]] and they entered [[H935]] the land [[H7704]] of Moab [[H4124]] and settled [[H1961]] there. [[H8033]]

### 3
Then Naomi’s [[H5281]] husband [[H376]] Elimelech [[H458]] died, [[H4191]] and she [[H1931]] was left [[H7604]] with her two [[H8147]] sons, [[H1121]]

### 4
who took [[H5375]] Moabite [[H4125]] women as their wives, [[H802]] one [[H259]] named [[H8034]] Orpah [[H6204]] and the other [[H8145]] named [[H8034]] Ruth. [[H7327]] And after they had lived [[H3427]] in Moab [[H8033]] about ten [[H6235]] years, [[H8141]]

### 5
both [[H8147]] Mahlon [[H4248]] and Chilion [[H3630]] also [[H1571]] died, [[H4191]] and Naomi [[H802]] was left [[H7604]] without her two [[H8147]] sons [[H3206]] and without her husband. [[H376]]

### 6
When [[H3588]] [Naomi] heard [[H8085]] in Moab [[H4124]] that [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3069]] had attended to [[H6485]] His people [[H5971]] by providing [[H5414]] them  with food, [[H3899]] she [[H1931]] and her daughters-in-law [[H3618]] prepared [[H6965]] to leave [[H7725]] the land [[H7704]] of Moab. [[H4124]]

### 7
So she left [[H3318]] the place [[H4725]] where [[H834]] she was, [[H1961]] accompanied [[H5973]] by her two [[H8147]] daughters-in-law, [[H3618]] and set out [[H1980]] on the road [[H1870]] leading back [[H7725]] to [[H413]] the land [[H776]] of Judah. [[H3063]]

### 8
Then Naomi [[H5281]] said [[H559]] to her two [[H8147]] daughters-in-law, [[H3618]] “Go [[H1980]] back, [[H7725]] each of you [[H802]] to your mother’s [[H517]] home. [[H1004]] May the LORD [[H3068]] show [[H6213]] you [[H5973]] loving devotion, [[H2617]] as [[H834]] you have shown [[H6213]] to [[H5973]] your dead [[H4191]] and to me. [[H5973]]

### 9
May the LORD [[H3068]] enable [[H5414]] each of you [[H802]] to find [[H4672]] security [[H4496]] in the home [[H1004]] of your new husband.” [[H376]] And she kissed [[H5401]] them  as they wept [[H1058]] aloud [[H5375]]

### 10
and said, [[H559]] “Surely [[H3588]] we will return [[H7725]] with you [[H854]] to your people.” [[H5971]]

### 11
But Naomi [[H5281]] replied, [[H559]] “Return home, [[H7725]] my daughters. [[H1323]] Why [[H4100]] would you go [[H1980]] with me? [[H5973]] [Are] there still [[H5750]] sons [[H1121]] in my womb [[H4578]] to become [[H1961]] your husbands? [[H376]]

### 12
Return home, [[H7725]] my daughters. [[H1323]] Go on, [[H1980]] for [[H3588]] I am too old [[H2204]] to have [[H1961]] another husband. [[H376]] Even if [[H3588]] I thought [[H559]] there was [[H3426]] hope [[H8615]] for me  to have [[H1961]] a husband [[H376]] tonight [[H3915]] and [[H1571]] to bear [[H3205]] sons, [[H1121]]

### 13
would you wait [[H7663]] for them [[H3860]] to [[H5704]] grow up? [[H1431]] Would you refrain [[H5702]] from [[H1115]] having [[H1961]] husbands? [[H376]] No, [[H408]] my daughters, [[H1323]] it grieves [[H4843]] me  very much [[H3966]] for [[H4480]] your sakes that [[H3588]] the hand [[H3027]] of the LORD [[H3068]] has gone out [[H3318]] against me.” 

### 14
Again [[H5750]] they wept [[H1058]] aloud, [[H5375]] and Orpah [[H6204]] kissed [[H5401]] her mother-in-law {goodbye}, [[H2545]] but Ruth [[H7327]] clung [[H1692]] to her. 

### 15
“Look,” [[H2009]] said Naomi, [[H559]] “your sister-in-law [[H2994]] has gone back [[H7725]] to [[H413]] her people [[H5971]] and [[H413]] her gods; [[H430]] follow [[H7725]] [her] back home.” [[H310]]

### 16
But Ruth [[H7327]] replied: [[H559]] “Do not [[H408]] urge [[H6293]] me  to leave you [[H5800]] [or] to turn [[H7725]] from following you. [[H310]] For [[H3588]] wherever [[H413]] you go, [[H1980]] I will go, [[H1980]] and wherever [[H834]] you live, [[H3885]] I will live; [[H3885]] your people [[H5971]] will be my people, [[H5971]] and your God [[H430]] will be my God. [[H430]]

### 17
Where [[H834]] you die, [[H4191]] I will die, [[H4191]] and there [[H8033]] I will be buried. [[H6912]] May the LORD [[H3068]] punish [[H3541]] me, [[H6213]] and ever so [[H3541]] severely, [[H3254]] if [[H3588]] anything but death [[H4194]] separates [[H6504]] you [[H996]] and me.” [[H996]]

### 18
When Naomi saw [[H7200]] that [[H3588]] Ruth [[H1931]] was determined [[H553]] to go [[H1980]] with her, [[H854]] she stopped [[H2308]] trying to persuade her. [[H1696]]

### 19
So [Naomi and Ruth] [[H8147]] traveled [[H1980]] until [[H5704]] they came [[H935]] to  Bethlehem. [[H1035]] When they [[H1961]] entered [[H935]] Bethlehem, [[H1035]] the whole [[H3605]] city [[H5892]] was stirred [[H1949]] because of them, [[H5921]] and the women [of the city] exclaimed, [[H559]] “Can this [[H2063]] be Naomi?” [[H5281]]

### 20
“Do not [[H408]] call [[H7121]] me Naomi,” [[H5281]] she replied. [[H559]] “Call [[H7121]] me Mara, [[H4755]] because [[H3588]] the Almighty [[H7706]] has dealt quite bitterly [[H4843]] with me. 

### 21
I [[H589]] went away [[H1980]] full, [[H4390]] but the LORD [[H3068]] has brought me back [[H7725]] empty. [[H7387]] Why [[H4100]] call [[H7121]] me Naomi, [[H5281]] since the LORD [[H3068]] has testified [[H6030]] against me,  and the Almighty [[H7706]] has afflicted [[H7489]] me?” 

### 22
So Naomi [[H5281]] returned [[H7725]] from the land [[H7704]] of Moab [[H4124]] with [[H5973]] her daughter-in-law [[H3618]] Ruth [[H7327]] the Moabitess. [[H4125]] And they [[H1992]] arrived [[H935]] in Bethlehem [[H1035]] at the beginning [[H8462]] of the barley [[H8184]] harvest. [[H7105]]
