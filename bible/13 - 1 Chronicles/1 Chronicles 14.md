### 1
Now King [[H4428]] Hiram  of Tyre [[H6865]] sent [[H7971]] envoys [[H4397]] to [[H413]] David, [[H1732]] along with cedar [[H730]] logs, [[H6086]] stonemasons, [[H2796]] and carpenters, [[H2796]] to build [[H1129]] a palace for him. [[H1004]]

### 2
And David [[H1732]] realized [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] had established [[H3559]] him as king [[H4428]] over [[H5921]] Israel [[H3478]] and [[H3588]] had highly [[H4605]] exalted [[H5375]] his kingdom [[H4438]] for the sake [[H5668]] of His people [[H5971]] Israel. [[H3478]]

### 3
And David [[H1732]] took [[H3947]] more [[H5750]] wives [[H802]] in Jerusalem [[H3389]] [and] [[H1732]] became the father [[H3205]] of more [[H5750]] sons [[H1121]] and daughters. [[H1323]]

### 4
These [[H428]] are the names [[H8034]] of the children born [[H3205]] to him in Jerusalem: [[H3389]] Shammua, [[H8051]] Shobab, [[H7727]] Nathan, [[H5416]] Solomon, [[H8010]]

### 5
Ibhar, [[H2984]] Elishua, [[H474]] Elpelet, [[H467]]

### 6
Nogah, [[H5052]] Nepheg, [[H5298]] Japhia, [[H3309]]

### 7
Elishama, [[H476]] Beeliada, [[H1182]] and Eliphelet. [[H467]]

### 8
When the Philistines [[H6430]] heard [[H8085]] that [[H3588]] David [[H1732]] had been anointed [[H4886]] king [[H4428]] over [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] Israel, [[H3478]] they [[H6430]] all [[H3605]] went [[H5927]] in search [[H1245]] of [him]; [[H1732]] but David [[H1732]] learned [of this] [[H8085]] and went out [[H3318]] to face them. [[H6440]]

### 9
Now the Philistines [[H6430]] had come [[H935]] and raided [[H6584]] the Valley [[H6010]] of Rephaim. [[H7497]]

### 10
So David [[H1732]] inquired [[H7592]] of God, [[H430]] “Should I go up [[H5927]] against [[H5921]] the Philistines? [[H6430]] Will You deliver them [[H5414]] into my hand?” [[H3027]] “Go,” [[H5927]] replied [[H559]] the LORD, [[H3068]] “for I will deliver them [[H5414]] into your hand.” [[H3027]]

### 11
So [David and his men] went up [[H5927]] to  Baal-perazim, [[H1188]] where [he] [[H1732]] defeated [[H5221]] the Philistines [[H8033]] [and] [[H1732]] said, [[H559]] “Like a bursting [[H6556]] flood, [[H4325]] God [[H430]] has burst out [[H6555]] against my enemies [[H341]] by my hand.” [[H3027]] So [[H5921]] they called [[H7121]] that [[H1931]] place [[H4725]] Baal-perazim. [[H1188]]

### 12
There [[H8033]] the Philistines abandoned [[H5800]] their gods, [[H430]] and David [[H1732]] ordered [[H559]] that they be burned [[H8313]] in the fire. [[H784]]

### 13
Once again [[H3254]] the Philistines [[H6430]] raided [[H6584]] the valley. [[H6010]]

### 14
So David [[H1732]] again [[H5750]] inquired [[H7592]] of God, [[H430]] who [[H430]] answered [[H559]] him,  “Do not [[H3808]] march up [[H5927]] after them, [[H310]] but circle around [[H5437]] them [[H5921]] and attack [[H935]] them [[H1992]] in front of [[H4136]] the balsam trees. [[H1057]]

### 15
As soon as [[H1961]] you hear [[H8085]] the sound [[H6963]] of marching [[H6807]] in the tops [[H7218]] of the balsam trees, [[H1057]] then [[H227]] move out [[H3318]] to battle, [[H4421]] because this will mean that [[H3588]] God [[H430]] has marched out [[H3318]] before you [[H6440]] to strike [[H5221]] the camp [[H4264]] of the Philistines.” [[H6430]]

### 16
So David [[H1732]] did [[H6213]] as [[H834]] God [[H430]] had commanded him, [[H6680]] and they struck down [[H5221]] the army of [[H4264]] the Philistines [[H6430]] all the way [[H5704]] from Gibeon [[H1391]] to Gezer. [[H1507]]

### 17
And David’s [[H1732]] fame [[H8034]] went out [[H3318]] into every [[H3605]] land, [[H776]] and the LORD [[H3068]] caused [[H5414]] all [[H3605]] nations [[H1471]] to fear him. [[H6343]]
