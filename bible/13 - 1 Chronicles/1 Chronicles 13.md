###### 1
Then David [[H1732]] conferred [[H3289]] with [[H5973]] all [[H3605]] his leaders, [[H5057]] the commanders [[H8269]] of hundreds [[H3967]] and of thousands. [[H505]]

###### 2
And he [[H1732]] said [[H559]] to the whole [[H3605]] assembly [[H6951]] of Israel, [[H3478]] “If [[H518]] it seems good [[H2895]] to you, [[H5921]] and if this is [[H4480]] of the LORD [[H3068]] our God, [[H430]] let us send word [[H7971]] far and wide [[H6555]] to [[H5921]] the rest [[H7604]] of our brothers [[H251]] in all [[H3605]] the land [[H776]] of Israel, [[H3478]] and also [[H5973]] to the priests [[H3548]] and Levites [[H3881]] in their cities [[H5892]] and pasturelands, [[H4054]] so that they may join [[H6908]] us. [[H413]]

###### 3
Then let us bring back [[H5437]] the ark [[H727]] of our God, [[H430]] for [[H3588]] we did not [[H3808]] inquire of Him [[H1875]] in the days [[H3117]] of Saul.” [[H7586]]

###### 4
And [[H559]] because [[H3588]] this proposal [[H1697]] seemed [[H5869]] right [[H3474]] to all [[H3605]] the people, [[H5971]] the whole [[H3605]] assembly [[H6951]] agreed to do it. [[H6213]]

###### 5
So David [[H1732]] assembled [[H6950]] all [[H3605]] the Israelites, [[H3478]] from [[H4480]] the [River] Shihor [[H7883]] in Egypt [[H4714]] to Lebo-hamath, [[H5704]] to bring [[H935]] the ark [[H727]] of God [[H430]] from Kiriath-jearim. [[H7157]]

###### 6
David [[H1732]] and all [[H3605]] Israel [[H3478]] went up [[H5927]] to Baalah [[H1173]] of [[H834]] Judah [[H3063]] (that is, Kiriath-jearim) [[H7157]] to bring up [[H5927]] from there [[H8033]] the ark [[H727]] of God [[H430]] the LORD, [[H3068]] who is enthroned [[H3427]] [between] the cherubim— [[H3742]] [the ark] [[H834]] that is called [[H7121]] by the Name. [[H8034]]

###### 7
So they carried [[H7392]] the ark [[H727]] of God [[H430]] from the house [[H1004]] of Abinadab [[H41]] on [[H5921]] a new [[H2319]] cart, [[H5699]] with Uzzah [[H5798]] and Ahio [[H283]] guiding [[H5090]] the cart. [[H5699]]

###### 8
David [[H1732]] and all [[H3605]] the Israelites [[H3478]] were celebrating [[H7832]] before [[H6440]] God [[H430]] with all [[H3605]] their might, [[H5797]] with songs [[H7892]] and on harps and lyres, [[H3658]] with tambourines, [[H8596]] cymbals, [[H4700]] and trumpets. [[H2689]]

###### 9
When they came [[H935]] to [[H5704]] the threshing floor [[H1637]] of Kidon, [[H3592]] Uzzah [[H5798]] reached out [[H7971]] and took hold [[H270]] of [[H853]] the ark, [[H727]] because [[H3588]] the oxen [[H1241]] had stumbled. [[H8058]]

###### 10
And the anger [[H639]] of the LORD [[H3068]] burned [[H2734]] against Uzzah, [[H5798]] and He struck him [[H5221]] down [[H5921]] because [[H834]] he had put [[H7971]] his hand [[H3027]] on [[H5921]] the ark. [[H727]] So he died [[H4191]] there [[H8033]] before [[H6440]] God. [[H430]]

###### 11
Then David [[H1732]] became angry [[H2734]] because [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] had burst forth [[H6555]] against Uzzah; [[H5798]] so he named [[H7121]] that [[H1931]] place [[H4725]] Perez-uzza, [[H6560]] as it is [called] to [[H5704]] this [[H2088]] day. [[H3117]]

###### 12
That [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] David [[H1732]] feared [[H3372]] God [[H430]] and asked, [[H559]] “How [[H1963]] can I ever bring [[H935]] the ark [[H727]] of God [[H430]] to me?” [[H413]]

###### 13
So [he] [[H1732]] did not [[H3808]] move [[H5493]] the ark [[H727]] with him [[H413]] to the City [[H5892]] of David; [[H1732]] instead, he took [[H5186]] it aside [[H413]] to [[H413]] the house [[H1004]] of Obed-edom [[H5654]] the Gittite. [[H1663]]

###### 14
Thus the ark [[H727]] of God [[H430]] remained [[H3427]] with [[H5973]] the family [[H1004]] of  Obed-edom [[H5654]] in his house [[H1004]] for three [[H7969]] months, [[H2320]] and the LORD [[H3068]] blessed [[H1288]] his [[H5654]] household [[H1004]] and everything [[H3605]] he owned.
