### 1
Now David [[H1732]] summoned [[H6950]] all [[H3605]] the leaders [[H8269]] of Israel [[H3478]] to [[H413]] Jerusalem: [[H3389]] the leaders [[H8269]] of the tribes, [[H7626]] the leaders [[H8269]] of the divisions [[H4256]] in the king’s [[H4428]] service, [[H8334]] the commanders [[H8269]] of thousands [[H505]] [and] [[H8269]] of hundreds, [[H3967]] and the officials [[H8269]] in charge of all [[H3605]] the property [[H7399]] and cattle [[H4735]] of the king [[H4428]] and his sons, [[H1121]] along with [[H5973]] the court officials, [[H5631]] the fighting men, [[H1368]] and all [[H3605]] the mighty warriors. [[H1368]]

### 2
Then King [[H4428]] David [[H1732]] rose [[H6965]] to [[H5921]] his feet [[H7272]] and said, [[H559]] “Listen to me, [[H8085]] my brothers [[H251]] and my people. [[H5971]] It was in [[H5973]] my heart [[H3824]] to build [[H1129]] a house [[H1004]] as a resting place [[H4496]] for the ark [[H727]] of the covenant [[H1285]] of the LORD [[H3068]] and as a footstool [[H1916]] for our God. [[H430]] I had made preparations [[H3559]] to build it, [[H1129]]

### 3
but God [[H430]] said [[H559]] to me,  ‘You are not [[H3808]] to build [[H1129]] a house [[H1004]] for My Name, [[H8034]] because [[H3588]] you [[H859]] are a man [[H376]] of war [[H4421]] who has spilled [[H8210]] blood.’ [[H1818]]

### 4
Yet the LORD, [[H3069]] the God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] chose [[H977]] me  out of all [[H3605]] my father’s [[H1]] house [[H1004]] to be [[H1961]] king [[H4428]] over [[H5921]] Israel [[H3478]] forever. [[H5769]] For [[H3588]] He chose [[H977]] Judah [[H3063]] as leader, [[H5057]] and from the house [[H1004]] of Judah [[H3063]] [He chose] my father’s [[H1]] household, [[H1004]] and from my father’s [[H1]] sons [[H1121]] He was pleased [[H7521]] to make me king [[H4427]] over [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] Israel. [[H3478]]

### 5
And of all [[H3605]] my sons— [[H1121]] for [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] has given [[H5414]] me many [[H7227]] sons— [[H1121]] He has chosen [[H977]] Solomon [[H8010]] my son [[H1121]] to sit [[H3427]] on [[H5921]] the throne [[H3678]] of the kingdom [[H4438]] of the LORD [[H3068]] over [[H5921]] Israel. [[H3478]]

### 6
And He said [[H559]] to me,  ‘Solomon [[H8010]] your son [[H1121]] is the one [[H1931]] who will build [[H1129]] My house [[H1004]] and My courts, [[H2691]] for [[H3588]] I have chosen [[H977]] him [as]  My  son, [[H1121]] and I [[H589]] will be [[H1961]] his  Father. [[H1]]

### 7
I will establish [[H3559]] his kingdom [[H4438]] forever, [[H5704]] if [[H518]] he resolutely [[H2388]] carries out [[H6213]] My commandments [[H4687]] and ordinances, [[H4941]] as is being done [[H3117]] this day.’ [[H2088]]

### 8
So now [[H6258]] in the sight [[H5869]] of all [[H3605]] Israel, [[H3478]] the assembly [[H6951]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] and in the hearing [[H241]] of our God, [[H430]] observe [[H8104]] and seek out [[H1875]] all [[H3605]] the commandments [[H4687]] of the LORD [[H3068]] your God, [[H430]] so that [[H4616]] you may possess [[H3423]] this good [[H2896]] land [[H776]] and leave it as an inheritance [[H5157]] to your descendants [[H1121]] forever. [[H5704]]

### 9
As for you, [[H859]] Solomon [[H8010]] my son, [[H1121]] know [[H3045]] the God [[H430]] of your father [[H1]] and serve Him [[H5647]] wholeheartedly [[H8003]] and with a willing [[H2655]] mind, [[H5315]] for [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] searches [[H1875]] every [[H3605]] heart [[H3824]] and understands [[H995]] the intention [[H3336]] of every [[H3605]] thought. [[H4284]] If [[H518]] you seek Him, [[H1875]] He will be found [[H4672]] by you;  but if [[H518]] you forsake Him, [[H5800]] He will reject you [[H2186]] forever. [[H5703]]

### 10
Consider [[H7200]] now [[H6258]] that [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] has chosen [[H977]] you  to build [[H1129]] a house [[H1004]] for the sanctuary. [[H4720]] Be strong [[H2388]] and do it.” [[H6213]]

### 11
Then David [[H1732]] gave [[H5414]] his son [[H1121]] Solomon [[H8010]] the plans [[H8403]] for the portico [of the temple], [[H197]] its buildings, [[H1004]] storehouses, [[H1597]] upper rooms, [[H5944]] inner [[H6442]] rooms, [[H2315]] and the room [[H1004]] for the mercy seat. [[H3727]]

### 12
The plans [[H8403]] contained everything [[H3605]] he had [[H1961]] in [[H5973]] mind [[H7307]] for the courts [[H2691]] of the house [[H1004]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] for all [[H3605]] the surrounding [[H5439]] rooms, [[H3957]] for the treasuries [[H214]] of the house [[H1004]] of God [[H430]] [and] [[H214]] of the dedicated things, [[H6944]]

### 13
for the divisions [[H4256]] of the priests [[H3548]] and the Levites, [[H3881]] for all [[H3605]] the work [[H4399]] of service [[H5656]] in the house [[H1004]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] and for all [[H3605]] the articles [[H3627]] of service [[H5656]] in the house [[H1004]] of the LORD: [[H3068]]

### 14
the weight [[H4948]] of all [[H3605]] the gold [[H2091]] articles [[H3627]] for every kind of service; [[H5656]] the weight [[H4948]] of all [[H3605]] the silver [[H3701]] articles [[H3627]] for every kind [[H3605]] of service; [[H5656]]

### 15
the weight [[H4948]] of the gold [[H2091]] lampstands [[H4501]] and their [[H2091]] lamps, [[H5216]] including the weight [[H4948]] of each lampstand [[H4501]] and its lamps; [[H5216]] the weight [[H4948]] of each silver [[H3701]] lampstand [[H4501]] and its lamps, [[H5216]] according to the use [[H5656]] of each lampstand; [[H4501]]

### 16
the weight [[H4948]] of gold [[H2091]] for each table [[H7979]] of showbread, [[H4635]] and of silver [[H3701]] for the silver [[H3701]] tables; [[H7979]]

### 17
[the weight of] the pure [[H2889]] gold [[H2091]] for the forks, [[H4207]] sprinkling basins, [[H4219]] and pitchers; [[H7184]] the weight [[H4948]] of each gold [[H2091]] dish; [[H3713]] the weight [[H4948]] of each silver [[H3701]] bowl; [[H3713]]

### 18
the weight [[H4948]] of the refined [[H2212]] gold [[H2091]] for the altar [[H4196]] of incense; [[H7004]] and the plans [[H8403]] for the chariot [[H4818]] of the gold [[H2091]] cherubim [[H3742]] that spread [their wings] [[H6566]] and overshadowed [[H5526]] the ark [[H727]] of the covenant [[H1285]] of the LORD. [[H3068]]

### 19
“All this,” [said David], [[H3605]] “all [[H3605]] the details [[H4399]] of this plan, [[H8403]] the LORD [[H3068]] made clear to me [[H7919]] in writing [[H3791]] by [His] hand [[H3027]] upon me.” [[H5921]]

### 20
David also [[H1732]] said [[H559]] to Solomon [[H8010]] his son, [[H1121]] “Be strong [[H2388]] and courageous, [[H553]] and do [it]. [[H6213]] Do not [[H408]] be afraid [[H3372]] or discouraged, [[H2865]] for [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] God, [[H430]] my God, [[H430]] is with you. [[H5973]] He will not [[H3808]] fail you [[H7503]] or forsake you [[H5800]] until [[H5704]] all [[H3605]] the work [[H4399]] for the service [[H5656]] of the house [[H1004]] of the LORD [[H3068]] is finished. [[H3615]]

### 21
The divisions [[H4256]] of the priests [[H3548]] and the Levites [[H3881]] are ready [[H2009]] for all [[H3605]] the service [[H5656]] of the house [[H1004]] of God, [[H430]] [and] [[H5973]] every [[H3605]] willing man [[H5081]] of every [[H3605]] skill [[H2451]] will be at your disposal for the work. [[H4399]] The officials [[H8269]] and all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] are fully at your [[H3605]] command.” [[H1697]]
