### 1
So they brought [[H935]] the ark [[H727]] of God [[H430]] and placed [[H3322]] it inside [[H8432]] the tent [[H168]] that [[H834]] David [[H1732]] had pitched [[H5186]] for it.  And they presented [[H7126]] burnt offerings [[H5930]] and peace offerings [[H8002]] before [[H6440]] God. [[H430]]

### 2
When David [[H1732]] had finished [[H3615]] sacrificing [[H5927]] the burnt offerings [[H5930]] and peace offerings, [[H8002]] he blessed [[H1288]] the people [[H5971]] in the name [[H8034]] of the LORD. [[H3068]]

### 3
Then he distributed [[H2505]] to each and every [[H3605]] Israelite, [[H376]] both men [[H376]] and [[H5704]] women, [[H802]] a loaf [[H3603]] of bread, [[H3899]] a date cake, [[H829]] and a raisin cake. [[H809]]

### 4
David appointed [[H5414]] some of [[H4480]] the Levites [[H3881]] to minister [[H8334]] before [[H6440]] the ark [[H727]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] to celebrate, [[H2142]] to give thanks, [[H3034]] and to praise [[H1984]] the LORD, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

### 5
Asaph [[H623]] was the chief, [[H7218]] Zechariah [[H2148]] was second, [[H4932]] [then] Jeiel, [[H3273]] Shemiramoth, [[H8070]] Jehiel, [[H3171]] Mattithiah, [[H4993]] Eliab, [[H446]] Benaiah, [[H1141]] Obed-edom, [[H5654]] and Jeiel. [[H3273]] They were to play the harps [[H5035]] and lyres, [[H3658]] while Asaph [[H623]] sounded [[H8085]] the cymbals [[H4700]]

### 6
and the priests [[H3548]] Benaiah [[H1141]] and Jahaziel [[H3166]] blew the trumpets [[H2689]] regularly [[H8548]] before [[H6440]] the ark [[H727]] of the covenant [[H1285]] of God. [[H430]]

### 7
On that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] David [[H1732]] first [[H7218]] committed [[H5414]] to [[H3027]] Asaph [[H623]] and his brothers [[H251]] [this song] of thanksgiving [[H3034]] to the LORD: [[H3068]]

### 8
“Give thanks [[H3034]] to the LORD; [[H3068]] call [[H7121]] upon His name; [[H8034]] make known [[H3045]] His deeds [[H5949]] among the nations. [[H5971]]

### 9
Sing [[H7891]] to Him,  sing praises [[H2167]] to Him;  tell [[H7878]] of all [[H3605]] His wonders. [[H6381]]

### 10
Glory [[H1984]] in His holy [[H6944]] name; [[H8034]] let the hearts [[H3820]] of those who seek [[H1245]] the LORD [[H3068]] rejoice. [[H8055]]

### 11
Seek out [[H1875]] the LORD [[H3068]] and His strength; [[H5797]] seek [[H1245]] His face [[H6440]] always. [[H8548]]

### 12
Remember [[H2142]] the wonders [[H6381]] He has done, [[H6213]] His marvels, [[H4159]] and the judgments [[H4941]] He has pronounced, [[H6310]]

### 13
O offspring [[H2233]] of Israel [[H3478]] His servant, [[H5650]] O sons [[H1121]] of Jacob, [[H3290]] His chosen ones. [[H972]]

### 14
He [[H1931]] is the LORD [[H3068]] our God; [[H430]] His judgments [carry] [[H4941]] throughout [[H3605]] the earth. [[H776]]

### 15
Remember [[H2142]] His covenant [[H1285]] forever, [[H5769]] the word [[H1697]] He ordained [[H6680]] for a thousand [[H505]] generations— [[H1755]]

### 16
[the covenant] [[H834]] He made [[H3772]] with [[H854]] Abraham, [[H85]] and the oath He swore [[H7621]] to Isaac. [[H3327]]

### 17
He confirmed it [[H5975]] to Jacob [[H3290]] as a decree, [[H2706]] to Israel [[H3478]] as an everlasting [[H5769]] covenant: [[H1285]]

### 18
‘I will give [[H5414]] you  the land [[H776]] of Canaan [[H3667]] as the portion [[H2256]] of your inheritance.’ [[H5159]]

### 19
When they were [[H1961]] few [[H4962]] in number, [[H4557]] few indeed, [[H4592]] and strangers [[H1481]] in [the land], 

### 20
they wandered [[H1980]] from nation [[H1471]] to [[H413]] nation [[H1471]] from [one] kingdom [[H4467]] to [[H413]] another. [[H312]]

### 21
He let [[H3240]] no [[H3808]] man [[H376]] oppress them; [[H6231]] He rebuked [[H3198]] kings [[H4428]] on their behalf: [[H5921]]

### 22
‘Do not [[H408]] touch [[H5060]] My anointed ones; [[H4899]] do no harm [[H408]] to My prophets.’ [[H5030]]

### 23
Sing [[H7891]] to the LORD, [[H3068]] all [[H3605]] the earth. [[H776]] Proclaim [[H1319]] His salvation [[H3444]] day [[H3117]] after [[H413]] day. [[H3117]]

### 24
Declare [[H5608]] His glory [[H3519]] among the nations, [[H1471]] His wonders [[H6381]] among all [[H3605]] peoples. [[H5971]]

### 25
For [[H3588]] great [[H1419]] is the LORD, [[H3068]] and greatly [[H3966]] to be praised; [[H1984]] He is to be feared [[H1931]] above [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] gods. [[H430]]

### 26
For [[H3588]] all [[H3605]] the gods [[H430]] of the nations [[H5971]] are idols, [[H457]] but [it is] the LORD [[H3068]] who made [[H6213]] the heavens. [[H8064]]

### 27
Splendor [[H1935]] and majesty [[H1926]] are before Him; [[H6440]] strength [[H5797]] and joy [[H2304]] fill His dwelling. [[H4725]]

### 28
Ascribe [[H3051]] to the LORD, [[H3068]] O families [[H4940]] of the nations, [[H5971]] ascribe [[H3051]] to the LORD [[H3068]] glory [[H3519]] and strength. [[H5797]]

### 29
Ascribe [[H3051]] to the LORD [[H3068]] the glory [[H3519]] [due] His name; [[H8034]] bring [[H5375]] an offering [[H4503]] and come [[H935]] before Him. [[H6440]] Worship [[H7812]] the LORD [[H3068]] in the splendor [[H1927]] of His holiness; [[H6944]]

### 30
tremble [[H2342]] before Him, [[H6440]] all [[H3605]] the earth. [[H776]] The world [[H8398]] is firmly established; [[H3559]] it cannot [[H1077]] be moved. [[H4131]]

### 31
Let the heavens [[H8064]] be glad, [[H8056]] and the earth [[H776]] rejoice; [[H1523]] let them say [[H559]] among the nations, [[H1471]] ‘The LORD [[H3068]] reigns!’ [[H4427]]

### 32
Let the sea [[H3220]] resound, [[H7481]] and all that fills it; [[H4393]] let the fields [[H7704]] exult, [[H5970]] and all [[H3605]] that [is] [[H834]] in them. 

### 33
Then [[H227]] the trees [[H6086]] of the forest [[H3293]] will sing for joy [[H7442]] before [[H6440]] the LORD, [[H3068]] for [[H3588]] He is coming [[H935]] to judge [[H8199]] the earth. [[H776]]

### 34
Give thanks [[H3034]] to the LORD, [[H3068]] for [[H3588]] He is good; [[H2896]] His loving devotion [[H2617]] endures forever. [[H5769]]

### 35
Then cry out: [[H559]] ‘Save us, [[H3467]] O God [[H430]] of our salvation; [[H3468]] gather [[H6908]] and deliver us [[H5337]] from [[H4480]] the nations, [[H1471]] that we may give thanks [[H3034]] to Your holy [[H6944]] name, [[H8034]] that we may glory [[H7623]] in Your praise.’ [[H8416]]

### 36
Blessed [be] [[H1288]] the LORD, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] from [[H4480]] everlasting [[H5769]] to [[H5704]] everlasting.” [[H5769]] Then all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] said, [[H559]] “Amen!” [[H543]] and “Praise [[H1984]] the LORD!” [[H3068]]

### 37
So David left [[H5800]] Asaph [[H623]] and his brothers [[H251]] there [[H8033]] before [[H6440]] the ark [[H727]] of the covenant [[H1285]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] to minister [[H8334]] [there] [[H6440]] regularly [[H8548]] according to the daily [[H3117]] requirements, [[H1697]]

### 38
along with  Obed-edom [[H5654]] and his sixty-eight [[H8346]] relatives. [[H251]] Obed-edom [[H5654]] son [[H1121]] of Jeduthun, [[H3038]] and also Hosah, [[H2621]] were to be gatekeepers. [[H7778]]

### 39
And [[H853]] David left Zadok [[H6659]] the priest [[H3548]] and his fellow [[H251]] priests [[H3548]] before [[H6440]] the tabernacle [[H4908]] of the LORD [[H3068]] at the high place [[H1116]] in Gibeon [[H1391]]

### 40
to regularly [[H8548]] present [[H5927]] burnt offerings [[H5930]] to the LORD [[H3068]] on [[H5921]] the altar [[H4196]] of burnt offerings, [[H5930]] morning [[H1242]] and evening, [[H6153]] according to all [[H3605]] that was written [[H3789]] in the law [[H8451]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] which [[H834]] He had commanded [[H6680]] Israel to keep. [[H3478]]

### 41
With them [[H5973]] were Heman, [[H1968]] Jeduthun, [[H3038]] and the rest [[H7605]] of those chosen [[H1305]] and designated [[H5344]] by name [[H8034]] to give thanks [[H3034]] to the LORD, [[H3068]] for [[H3588]] “His loving devotion [[H2617]] endures forever.” [[H5769]]

### 42
Heman [[H1968]] and Jeduthun [[H3038]] had with them [[H5973]] trumpets [[H2689]] and cymbals [[H4700]] for the music [[H8085]] and instruments [[H3627]] [for] the songs [[H7892]] of God. [[H430]] And the sons [[H1121]] of Jeduthun [[H3038]] were stationed at the gate. [[H8179]]

### 43
Then all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] departed [[H1980]] for their homes, [[H1004]] and David [[H1732]] returned home [[H5437]] to bless [[H1288]] his household. [[H1004]]
