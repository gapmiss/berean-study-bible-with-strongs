# Matthew 9

[[Matthew 8|←]] • [[Matthew 10|→]]

---

### 1
[Jesus] got into [[G1684]] a boat, [[G4143]] crossed over, [[G1276]] and [[G2532]] came [[G2064]] to [[G1519]] [His] [[G3588]] own [[G2398]] town. [[G4172]]

### 2
Just then, [[G2532]] [some men] brought [[G4374]] to Him [[G846]] a paralytic [[G3885]] lying [[G906]] on [[G1909]] a mat. [[G2825]] When [[G2532]] Jesus [[G2424]] saw [[G3708]] their [[G846]] faith, [[G4102]] He said [[G2036]] to the [[G3588]] paralytic, [[G3885]] “Take courage, [[G2293]] son; [[G5043]] your [[G4771]] sins [[G266]] are forgiven.” [[G863]]

### 3
On seeing this, [[G2532]] some [[G5100]] of the [[G3588]] scribes [[G1122]] said [[G2036]] to [[G1722]] themselves, [[G1438]] “This [man] [[G3778]] is blaspheming!” [[G987]]

### 4
But [[G2532]] Jesus [[G2424]] knew [[G1492]] what [[G3588]] they [[G846]] were thinking [[G1761]] [and] said, [[G2036]] “Why [[G2443]] do you harbor [[G1760]] evil [[G4190]] in [[G1722]] your [[G4771]] hearts? [[G2588]]

### 5
Which [[G5101]] is [[G1510]] easier: [[G2123]] to say, [[G2036]] ‘Your [[G4771]] sins [[G266]] are forgiven,’ [[G863]] or [[G2228]] to say, [[G2036]] ‘Get up [[G1453]] and [[G2532]] walk?’ [[G4043]]

### 6
But [[G1161]] so that [[G2443]] you may know [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of Man [[G444]] has [[G2192]] authority [[G1849]] on [[G1909]] earth [[G1093]] to forgive [[G863]] sins...” [[G266]] Then [[G5119]] He said [[G3004]] to the [[G3588]] paralytic, [[G3885]] “Get up, [[G1453]] pick up [[G142]] your [[G4771]] mat, [[G2825]] and [[G2532]] go [[G5217]] home.” [[G3624]]

### 7
And [[G2532]] [the man] got up [[G1453]] and went [[G565]] home. [[G3624]]

### 8
When [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] crowds [[G3793]] saw this, [[G3708]] they were filled with awe [[G5399]] and [[G2532]] glorified [[G1392]] God, [[G2316]] who had given [[G1325]] such [[G5108]] authority [[G1849]] to men. [[G444]]

### 9
As [[G2532]] Jesus [[G2424]] went on [[G3855]] from there, [[G1564]] He saw [[G3708]] a man [[G444]] named [[G3004]] Matthew [[G3156]] sitting [[G2521]] at [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] tax booth. [[G5058]] “Follow [[G190]] Me,” [[G1473]] He told [[G3004]] him, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] [Matthew] got up [[G450]] [and] followed [[G190]] Him. [[G846]]

### 10
Later, [[G2532]] as [[G1096]] [Jesus] [[G846]] was dining [[G345]] at [[G1722]] [Matthew’s] [[G3588]] house, [[G3614]] many [[G4183]] tax collectors [[G5057]] and [[G2532]] sinners [[G268]] came [[G2064]] [and] ate with [[G4873]] [Him] [[G2424]] and [[G2532]] His [[G846]] disciples. [[G3101]]

### 11
When [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] Pharisees [[G5330]] saw this, [[G3708]] they asked [[G2036]] His [[G846]] disciples, [[G3101]] “Why [[G1223]] {does} your [[G4771]] Teacher [[G1320]] eat [[G2068]] with [[G3326]] tax collectors [[G5057]] and [[G2532]] sinners?” [[G268]]

### 12
[On] [[G1161]] hearing this, [[G191]] [Jesus] said, [[G2036]] “[It is] not [[G3756]] the [[G3588]] healthy [[G2480]] [who] [[G2192]] need [[G5532]] a doctor, [[G2395]] but [[G235]] the [[G3588]] sick. [[G2560]]

### 13
But [[G1161]] go [[G4198]] [and] learn [[G3129]] what [[G5101]] this means: [[G1510]] ‘I desire [[G2309]] mercy, [[G1656]] not [[G3756]] sacrifice.’ [[G2378]] For [[G1063]] I have not come [[G2064]] to call [[G2564]] [the] righteous, [[G1342]] but [[G235]] sinners.” [[G268]]

### 14
At that time, [[G5119]] John’s [[G2491]] disciples [[G3101]] came [[G4334]] to [Jesus] [[G846]] [and] asked, [[G3004]] “Why is it that [[G1223]] we [[G1473]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] Pharisees [[G5330]] fast [[G3522]] so often, [[G4183]] but [[G1161]] Your [[G4771]] disciples [[G3101]] {do} not [[G3756]] fast?” [[G3522]]

### 15
Jesus [[G2424]] replied, [[G2036]] “How can [[G1410]] the [[G3588]] attendants [[G5207]] of the [[G3588]] bridegroom [[G3567]] mourn [[G3996]] while [[G3745]] [He] [[G3566]] is [[G1510]] with [[G3326]] them? [[G846]] But [[G1161]] [the] time [[G2250]] will come [[G2064]] when [[G3752]] the [[G3588]] bridegroom [[G3566]] will be taken away [[G522]] from [[G575]] them; [[G846]] then [[G5119]] they will fast. [[G3522]]

### 16
No one [[G3762]] sews [[G1911]] a patch [[G1915]] of unshrunk [[G46]] cloth [[G4470]] on [[G1909]] an old [[G3820]] garment. [[G2440]] For [[G1063]] the [[G3588]] patch [[G4138]] will pull away [[G142]] from [[G575]] the [[G3588]] garment, [[G2440]] and [[G2532]] a worse [[G5501]] tear [[G4978]] will result. [[G1096]]

### 17
Neither [[G3761]] do [men] pour [[G906]] new [[G3501]] wine [[G3631]] into [[G1519]] old [[G3820]] wineskins. [[G779]] If they do, [[G1487]] the [[G3588]] skins [[G779]] will burst, [[G4486]] the [[G3588]] wine [[G3631]] will spill, [[G1632]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] wineskins [[G779]] will be ruined. [[G622]] Instead, [[G235]] they pour [[G906]] new [[G3501]] wine [[G3631]] into [[G1519]] new [[G2537]] wineskins, [[G779]] and [[G2532]] both [[G297]] are preserved. [[G4933]]

### 18
While [[G846]] [Jesus] was saying [[G2980]] these things, [[G3778]] a [[G1520]] synagogue ruler [[G758]] came [[G2064]] [and] knelt [[G4352]] before Him. [[G846]] “My [[G1473]] daughter [[G2364]] has just died,” [[G5053]] he said. [[G3004]] “But [[G235]] come [[G2064]] [and] place [[G2007]] Your [[G4771]] hand [[G5495]] on [[G1909]] her, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] she will live.” [[G2198]]

### 19
So [[G2532]] Jesus [[G2424]] got up [[G1453]] [and] went with [[G190]] him, [[G846]] along with [[G2532]] His [[G846]] disciples. [[G3101]]

### 20
Suddenly [[G2532]] a woman [[G1135]] who had suffered from bleeding [[G131]] [for] twelve [[G1427]] years [[G2094]] came up [[G4334]] behind [Him] [[G3693]] [and] touched [[G680]] the [[G3588]] fringe [[G2899]] of [[G3588]] His [[G846]] cloak. [[G2440]]

### 21
She said [[G2036]] to [[G1722]] herself, [[G1438]] “If [[G1437]] only [[G3440]] I touch [[G680]] His [[G846]] cloak, [[G2440]] I will be healed.” [[G4982]]

### 22
Jesus [[G2424]] turned [[G4762]] and [[G2532]] saw [[G3708]] her. [[G846]] “Take courage, [[G2293]] daughter,” [[G2364]] He said, [[G2036]] “your [[G4771]] faith [[G4102]] has healed [[G4982]] you.” [[G4771]] And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] woman [[G1135]] was cured [[G4982]] from [[G575]] that [[G3588]] very [[G1565]] hour. [[G5610]]

### 23
When [[G2532]] Jesus [[G2424]] entered [[G2064]] the [[G3588]] ruler’s [[G758]] house, [[G3614]] He saw [[G3708]] the [[G3588]] flute players [[G834]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] noisy [[G2350]] crowd. [[G3793]]

### 24
“Go away,” [[G402]] He told them. [[G2036]] “The [[G3588]] girl [[G2877]] is not dead, [[G3756]] but [[G235]] asleep.” [[G2518]] And [[G2532]] they laughed at [[G2606]] Him. [[G846]]

### 25
After [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] crowd [[G3793]] had been put outside, [[G1544]] [Jesus] went in [[G1525]] [and] took [[G2902]] [the girl] [[G846]] by the [[G3588]] hand, [[G5495]] and [[G2532]] [she] [[G2877]] got up. [[G1453]]

### 26
And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] news [[G5345]] about this [[G3778]] spread [[G1831]] throughout [[G1519]] that [[G1565]] region. [[G1093]]

### 27
As [[G2532]] Jesus [[G2424]] went on [[G3855]] from there, [[G1564]] two [[G1417]] blind [men] [[G5185]] followed [[G190]] Him, [[G846]] crying out, [[G2896]] “Have mercy on [[G1653]] us, [[G1473]] Son [[G5207]] of David!” [[G1138]]

### 28
After [[G1161]] [Jesus] had entered [[G2064]] the [[G3588]] house, [[G3614]] the [[G3588]] blind [men] [[G5185]] came [[G4334]] to Him. [[G846]] “Do you believe [[G4100]] that [[G3754]] I am able [[G1410]] to do [[G4160]] this?” [[G3778]] [He] [[G2424]] asked. [[G3004]] “Yes, [[G3483]] Lord,” [[G2962]] they answered. [[G3004]]

### 29
Then [[G5119]] He touched [[G680]] their [[G846]] eyes [[G3788]] [and] said, [[G3004]] “According to [[G2596]] your [[G4771]] faith [[G4102]] will it be done [[G1096]] to you.” [[G4771]]

### 30
And [[G2532]] their [[G846]] eyes [[G3788]] were opened. [[G455]] Jesus [[G2424]] warned them sternly, [[G1690]] “See that [[G3708]] no one [[G3367]] finds out about this!” [[G1097]]

### 31
But [[G1161]] they went out [[G1831]] and spread the news [[G1310]] about Him [[G846]] throughout [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] land. [[G1093]]

### 32
As [[G1161]] they [[G846]] were leaving, [[G1831]] a demon-possessed [[G1139]] man [[G444]] who was mute [[G2974]] was brought [[G4374]] to [Jesus]. [[G846]]

### 33
And when [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] demon [[G1140]] had been driven out, [[G1544]] the [[G3588]] [man] [[G2974]] began to speak. [[G2980]] The [[G3588]] crowds [[G3793]] were amazed [[G2296]] [and] said, [[G3004]] “Nothing [[G3763]] like this [[G3779]] has ever been seen [[G5316]] in [[G1722]] Israel!” [[G2474]]

### 34
But [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] Pharisees [[G5330]] said, [[G2036]] “[It is] by [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] prince [[G758]] of [[G3588]] demons [[G1140]] [that] He drives out [[G1544]] demons.” [[G1140]]

### 35
Jesus [[G2424]] went through [[G4013]] all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] towns [[G4172]] and [[G2532]] villages, [[G2968]] teaching [[G1321]] in [[G1722]] their [[G846]] synagogues, [[G4864]] preaching [[G2784]] the [[G3588]] gospel [[G2098]] of the [[G3588]] kingdom, [[G932]] and [[G2532]] healing [[G2323]] every [[G3956]] disease [[G3554]] and [[G2532]] sickness. [[G3119]]

### 36
When [[G1161]] He saw [[G3708]] the [[G3588]] crowds, [[G3793]] He was moved with compassion [[G4697]] for [[G4012]] them, [[G846]] because [[G3754]] they were [[G1510]] harassed [[G4660]] and [[G2532]] helpless, [[G4496]] like [[G5616]] sheep [[G4263]] without [[G3361]] a shepherd. [[G4166]]

### 37
Then [[G5119]] He said [[G3004]] to [[G3588]] his [[G846]] disciples, [[G3101]] “The [[G3588]] harvest [[G2326]] [is] plentiful, [[G4183]] but [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] workers [[G2040]] [are] few. [[G3641]]

### 38
Ask [[G1189]] the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] of the [[G3588]] harvest, [[G2326]] therefore, [[G3767]] to send out [[G1544]] workers [[G2040]] into [[G1519]] His [[G846]] harvest.” [[G2326]]
