### 1
Then [[G5119]] Jesus [[G2424]] was led [[G321]] by [[G5259]] the [[G3588]] Spirit [[G4151]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] wilderness [[G2048]] to be tempted [[G3985]] by [[G5259]] the [[G3588]] devil. [[G1228]]

### 2
After fasting [[G3522]] forty [[G5062]] days [[G2250]] and [[G2532]] forty [[G5062]] nights, [[G3571]] He was hungry. [[G3983]]

### 3
The [[G3588]] tempter [[G3985]] came [[G4334]] to Him [[G846]] [and] said, [[G2036]] “If [[G1487]] You are [[G1510]] [the] Son [[G5207]] of God, [[G2316]] tell [[G2036]] these [[G3778]] stones [[G3037]] to become [[G1096]] bread.” [[G740]]

### 4
But [[G1161]] [Jesus] answered, [[G611]] “It is written: [[G1125]] ‘Man [[G444]] shall not live [[G2198]] on [[G1909]] bread [[G740]] alone, [[G3441]] but [[G235]] on [[G1909]] every [[G3956]] word [[G4487]] that comes [[G1607]] from [[G1223]] [the] mouth [[G4750]] of God.’” [[G2316]]

### 5
Then [[G5119]] the [[G3588]] devil [[G1228]] took [[G3880]] Him [[G846]] to [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] holy [[G40]] city [[G4172]] and [[G2532]] set [[G2476]] Him [[G846]] on [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] pinnacle [[G4419]] of the [[G3588]] temple. [[G2411]]

### 6
“If [[G1487]] You are [[G1510]] [the] Son [[G5207]] of God,” [[G2316]] he said, [[G3004]] “throw [[G906]] Yourself [[G4572]] down. [[G2736]] For [[G1063]] it is written: [[G1125]] ‘He will command [[G1781]] His [[G846]] angels [[G32]] concerning [[G4012]] You, [[G4771]] and [[G2532]] they will lift You up [[G142]] in [[G1909]] [their] hands, [[G5495]] so that You will not strike [[G4350]] Your [[G4771]] foot [[G4228]] against [[G4314]] a stone.” [[G3037]]

### 7
Jesus [[G2424]] replied, [[G5346]] “It is also written: [[G1125]] ‘Do not put [[G1598]] [the] Lord [[G2962]] your [[G4771]] God {to the test}.’” [[G2316]]

### 8
Again, [[G3825]] the [[G3588]] devil [[G1228]] took [[G3880]] Him [[G846]] to [[G1519]] a very [[G3029]] high [[G5308]] mountain [[G3735]] and [[G2532]] showed [[G1166]] Him [[G846]] all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] kingdoms [[G932]] of the [[G3588]] world [[G2889]] and [[G2532]] their [[G846]] glory. [[G1391]]

### 9
“All [[G3956]] this [[G3778]] I will give [[G1325]] You,” [[G4771]] he said, [[G2036]] “if [[G1437]] You will fall down [[G4098]] [and] worship [[G4352]] me.” [[G1473]]

### 10
“Away from me, [[G5217]] Satan!” [[G4567]] Jesus [[G2424]] declared. [[G3004]] “For [[G1063]] it is written: [[G1125]] ‘Worship [[G4352]] [the] Lord [[G2962]] your [[G4771]] God [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] serve [[G3000]] Him [[G846]] only.’” [[G3441]]

### 11
Then [[G5119]] the [[G3588]] devil [[G1228]] left [[G863]] Him, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] angels [[G32]] came [[G4334]] and [[G2532]] ministered [[G1247]] to Him. [[G846]]

### 12
When [[G1161]] [Jesus] heard [[G191]] that [[G3754]] John [[G2491]] had been imprisoned, [[G3860]] He withdrew [[G402]] to [[G1519]] Galilee. [[G1056]]

### 13
Leaving [[G2641]] Nazareth, [[G3478]] He went [[G2064]] [and] lived [[G2730]] in [[G1519]] Capernaum, [[G2584]] which [is] [[G3588]] by the sea [[G3864]] in [[G1722]] [the] region [[G3725]] of Zebulun [[G2194]] and [[G2532]] Naphtali, [[G3508]]

### 14
to [[G2443]] fulfill [[G4137]] what [[G3588]] was spoken [[G2046]] through [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] prophet [[G4396]] Isaiah: [[G2268]]

### 15
“Land [[G1093]] of Zebulun [[G2194]] and [[G2532]] land [[G1093]] of Naphtali, [[G3508]] [the] way [[G3598]] to [the] sea, [[G2281]] beyond [[G4008]] the [[G3588]] Jordan, [[G2446]] Galilee [[G1056]] of the [[G3588]] Gentiles— [[G1484]]

### 16
the [[G3588]] people [[G2992]] living [[G2521]] in [[G1722]] darkness [[G4653]] have seen [[G3708]] [a] great [[G3173]] light; [[G5457]] on those [[G3588]] living [[G2521]] in [the] [[G1722]] land [[G5561]] [of the] shadow [[G4639]] of death, [[G2288]] a light [[G5457]] has dawned.” [[G393]]

### 17
From [[G575]] that time [on] [[G5119]] Jesus [[G2424]] began [[G756]] to preach, [[G2784]] “Repent, [[G3340]] for [[G1063]] the [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] of [[G3588]] heaven [[G3772]] is near.” [[G1448]]

### 18
As [Jesus] was walking [[G4043]] beside [[G3844]] the [[G3588]] Sea [[G2281]] of Galilee, [[G1056]] He saw [[G3708]] two [[G1417]] brothers, [[G80]] Simon [[G4613]] called [[G3004]] Peter [[G4074]] and [[G2532]] his [[G846]] brother [[G80]] Andrew. [[G406]] They were casting [[G906]] a net [[G293]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] sea, [[G2281]] for [[G1063]] they were [[G1510]] fishermen. [[G231]]

### 19
“Come, follow [[G1205]] Me,” [[G1473]] [Jesus] said, [[G3004]] “and [[G2532]] I will make [[G4160]] you [[G4771]] fishers [[G231]] of men.” [[G444]]

### 20
And [[G1161]] at once [[G2112]] they left [[G863]] [their] [[G3588]] nets [[G1350]] [and] followed [[G190]] Him. [[G846]]

### 21
Going on [[G4260]] from there, [[G1564]] He saw [[G3708]] two [[G1417]] other [[G243]] brothers, [[G80]] James [[G2385]] [son] [[G3588]] of Zebedee [[G2199]] and [[G2532]] his [[G846]] brother [[G80]] John. [[G2491]] [They were] in [[G1722]] a boat [[G4143]] with [[G3326]] their [[G846]] father [[G3962]] Zebedee, [[G2199]] mending [[G2675]] their [[G846]] nets. [[G1350]] [Jesus] called [[G2564]] them, [[G846]]

### 22
and [[G1161]] immediately [[G2112]] they left [[G863]] the [[G3588]] boat [[G4143]] and [[G2532]] their [[G846]] father [[G3962]] [and] followed [[G190]] Him. [[G846]]

### 23
[Jesus] went [[G4013]] throughout [[G1722]] Galilee, [[G1056]] teaching [[G1321]] in [[G1722]] their [[G846]] synagogues, [[G4864]] preaching [[G2784]] the [[G3588]] gospel [[G2098]] of the [[G3588]] kingdom, [[G932]] and [[G2532]] healing [[G2323]] every [[G3956]] disease [[G3554]] and [[G2532]] sickness [[G3119]] among [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] people. [[G2992]]

### 24
News [[G189]] about Him [[G846]] spread [[G565]] all [[G3650]] over [[G1519]] Syria, [[G4947]] and [[G2532]] [people] brought [[G4374]] to Him [[G846]] all [[G3956]] who [[G3588]] were ill [[G2560]] with [[G2192]] various [[G4164]] diseases, [[G3554]] those suffering [[G4912]] acute pain, [[G931]] [the] demon-possessed, [[G1139]] [those] having seizures, [[G4583]] and [[G2532]] [the] paralyzed [[G3885]] and [[G2532]] He healed [[G2323]] them. [[G846]]

### 25
[The] large [[G4183]] crowds [[G3793]] that followed [[G190]] Him [[G846]] came from [[G575]] Galilee, [[G1056]] [the] Decapolis, [[G1179]] Jerusalem, [[G2414]] Judea, [[G2449]] and [[G2532]] beyond [[G4008]] the [[G3588]] Jordan. [[G2446]]
