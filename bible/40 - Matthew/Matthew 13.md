### 1
That [[G1565]] [same] [[G3588]] day [[G2250]] Jesus [[G2424]] went out [[G1831]] of the [[G3588]] house [[G3614]] [and] sat [[G2521]] by [[G3844]] the [[G3588]] sea. [[G2281]]

### 2
[Such] [[G2532]] large [[G4183]] crowds [[G3793]] gathered [[G4863]] around [[G4314]] Him [[G846]] that [[G5620]] He [[G846]] got into [[G1684]] a boat [[G4143]] [and] sat down, [[G2521]] while [[G2532]] all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] people [[G3793]] stood [[G2476]] on [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] shore. [[G123]]

### 3
And [[G2532]] He told [[G2980]] them [[G846]] many things [[G4183]] in [[G1722]] parables, [[G3850]] saying, [[G3004]] “A farmer [[G4687]] went out [[G1831]] to sow his seed. [[G4687]]

### 4
As [[G1722]] he was [[G846]] sowing, [[G4687]] some [seeds] [[G3739]] fell [[G4098]] along [[G3844]] the [[G3588]] path, [[G3598]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] birds [[G4071]] came [[G2064]] [and] devoured [[G2719]] them. [[G846]]

### 5
Some [[G243]] fell [[G4098]] on [[G1909]] rocky ground, [[G4075]] where [[G3699]] they did not have [[G2192]] much [[G4183]] soil. [[G1093]] They sprang up [[G1816]] quickly, [[G2112]] because [[G1223]] the soil [[G1093]] was [[G2192]] shallow. [[G899]]

### 6
But [[G1161]] [when the] sun [[G2246]] rose, [[G393]] [the seedlings] were scorched, [[G2739]] and [[G2532]] they withered [[G3583]] because [[G1223]] they had [[G2192]] no [[G3361]] root. [[G4491]]

### 7
Other [seeds] [[G243]] fell [[G4098]] among [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] thorns, [[G173]] [which] [[G173]] grew up [[G305]] and [[G2532]] choked [[G4155]] [the seedlings]. [[G846]]

### 8
Still [[G1161]] other [seeds] [[G243]] fell [[G4098]] on [[G1909]] good [[G2570]] soil [[G1093]] and [[G2532]] produced [[G1325]] a crop— [[G2590]] a hundredfold, [[G1540]] sixtyfold, [[G1835]] [or] [[G1161]] thirtyfold. [[G5144]]

### 9
He who [[G3588]] has [[G2192]] ears, [[G3775]] let him hear.” [[G191]]

### 10
Then [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] disciples [[G3101]] came to [Jesus] [[G4334]] [and] asked, [[G2036]] “Why [[G1223]] do You speak [[G2980]] to [the people] [[G846]] in [[G1722]] parables?” [[G3850]]

### 11
He replied, [[G611]] “The knowledge [[G1097]] of the [[G3588]] mysteries [[G3466]] of the [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] of [[G3588]] heaven [[G3772]] has been given [[G1325]] to you, [[G4771]] but [[G1161]] not [[G3756]] to them. [[G1565]]

### 12
Whoever [[G3748]] has [[G2192]] will be given [more], [[G1325]] and [[G2532]] he will have an abundance. [[G4052]] Whoever [[G3748]] [does] not [[G3756]] have, [[G2192]] even [[G2532]] what [[G3739]] he has [[G2192]] will be taken away [[G142]] from [[G575]] him. [[G846]]

### 13
This [[G3778]] is why [[G1223]] I speak [[G2980]] to them [[G846]] in [[G1722]] parables: [[G3850]] ‘Though [[G3754]] seeing, [[G991]] they do not see; [[G991]] [though] [[G2532]] hearing, [[G191]] they do not hear [[G191]] [or] [[G3761]] understand.’ [[G4920]]

### 14
In them [[G846]] the [[G3588]] prophecy [[G4394]] of Isaiah [[G2268]] is fulfilled: [[G378]] ‘You will be ever hearing [[G191]] but [[G2532]] never [[G3756]] understanding; [[G4920]] you will be ever seeing [[G991]] but [[G2532]] never [[G3756]] perceiving. [[G3708]]

### 15
For [[G1063]] this [[G3778]] people’s [[G2992]] heart [[G2588]] has grown callous; [[G3975]] they hardly hear [[G191]] with [their] [[G3588]] ears, [[G3775]] and [[G2532]] they have closed [[G2576]] their [[G846]] eyes. [[G3788]] Otherwise [[G3361]] they might see [[G3708]] with [their] [[G3588]] eyes, [[G3788]] hear [[G191]] with [their] [[G3588]] ears, [[G3775]] understand [[G4920]] with [their] [[G3588]] hearts, [[G2588]] and [[G2532]] turn, [[G1994]] and [[G2532]] I would heal [[G2390]] them.’ [[G846]]

### 16
But [[G1161]] blessed [are] [[G3107]] your [[G4771]] eyes [[G3788]] because [[G3754]] they see, [[G991]] and [[G2532]] your [[G4771]] ears [[G3775]] because [[G3754]] they hear. [[G191]]

### 17
For [[G1063]] truly [[G281]] I tell [[G3004]] you, [[G4771]] many [[G4183]] prophets [[G4396]] and [[G2532]] righteous [men] [[G1342]] longed [[G1937]] to see [[G3708]] what [[G3739]] you see [[G991]] [but] [[G2532]] did not see [it], [[G3708]] and [[G2532]] to hear [[G191]] what [[G3739]] you hear [[G191]] [but] [[G2532]] did not hear [it]. [[G191]]

### 18
Consider, [[G191]] then, [[G3767]] the [[G3588]] parable [[G3850]] of the [[G3588]] sower: [[G4687]]

### 19
When anyone [[G3956]] hears [[G191]] the [[G3588]] message [[G3056]] of the [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] but [[G2532]] {does} not [[G3361]] understand [it], [[G4920]] the [[G3588]] evil one [[G4190]] comes [[G2064]] and [[G2532]] snatches away [[G726]] what [[G3588]] was sown [[G4687]] in [[G1722]] his [[G846]] heart. [[G2588]] This [[G3778]] is [[G1510]] the [seed] [[G3588]] sown [[G4687]] along [[G3844]] the [[G3588]] path. [[G3598]]

### 20
The [seed] [[G3588]] sown [[G4687]] on [[G1909]] rocky ground [[G4075]] is [[G1510]] the [one who] [[G3588]] hears [[G191]] the [[G3588]] word [[G3056]] and [[G2532]] promptly [[G2112]] receives [[G2983]] it [[G846]] with [[G3326]] joy. [[G5479]]

### 21
But [[G235]] since [[G1161]] he has [[G2192]] no [[G3756]] root, [[G4491]] he remains [[G1510]] for only a season. [[G4340]] [When] [[G1161]] trouble [[G2347]] or [[G2228]] persecution [[G1375]] comes [[G1096]] because of [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] word, [[G3056]] he quickly falls away. [[G4624]]

### 22
The [seed] [[G3588]] sown [[G4687]] among [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] thorns [[G173]] is [[G1510]] the [one who] [[G3588]] hears [[G191]] the [[G3588]] word, [[G3056]] but [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] worries [[G3308]] of [[G3588]] this [[G3778]] world [[G165]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] deceitfulness [[G539]] of wealth [[G4149]] choke [[G4846]] the [[G3588]] word, [[G3056]] and [[G2532]] it becomes [[G1096]] unfruitful. [[G175]]

### 23
But [[G1161]] the [seed] [[G3588]] sown [[G4687]] on [[G1909]] good [[G2570]] soil [[G1093]] is [[G1510]] the [one who] [[G3588]] hears [[G191]] the [[G3588]] word [[G3056]] [and] [[G2532]] understands [it]. [[G4920]] [He] [[G3739]] indeed [[G1211]] bears fruit [[G2592]] and [[G2532]] produces a crop— [[G4160]] a hundredfold, [[G1540]] sixtyfold, [[G1835]] or [[G1161]] thirtyfold. [[G5144]]

### 24
[Jesus] presented [[G3908]] another [[G243]] parable [[G3850]] to them: [[G846]] “The [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] of [[G3588]] heaven [[G3772]] is like [[G3666]] a man [[G444]] who sowed [[G4687]] good [[G2570]] seed [[G4690]] in [[G1722]] his [[G846]] field. [[G68]]

### 25
But [[G1161]] while [[G1722]] everyone [[G444]] was asleep, [[G2518]] his [[G846]] enemy [[G2190]] came [[G2064]] and [[G2532]] sowed [[G4687]] weeds [[G2215]] among [[G303]] the [[G3588]] wheat, [[G4621]] and [[G2532]] slipped away. [[G565]]

### 26
When [[G3753]] the [[G3588]] wheat [[G5528]] sprouted [[G985]] and [[G2532]] bore [[G4160]] grain, [[G2590]] then [[G5119]] the [[G3588]] weeds [[G2215]] also [[G2532]] appeared. [[G5316]]

### 27
The [[G3588]] owner’s [[G3617]] servants [[G1401]] came [[G4334]] to him [[G846]] [and] said, [[G2036]] ‘Sir, [[G2962]] didn’t you sow [[G4687]] good [[G2570]] seed [[G4690]] in [[G1722]] your [[G4674]] field? [[G68]] Where [[G4159]] then [[G3767]] did [[G2192]] [the] weeds {come from}?’ [[G2215]]

### 28
‘An enemy [[G2190]] did [[G4160]] this,’ [[G3778]] he replied. [[G5346]] [So] [[G1161]] [the] servants [[G1401]] asked [[G3004]] him, [[G846]] ‘Do you want [[G2309]] us to go [and] [[G565]] pull them up?’ [[G4816]]

### 29
‘No,’ [[G3756]] he said, [[G5346]] ‘if [[G4219]] you pull [[G4816]] the [[G3588]] weeds [now], [[G2215]] you might uproot [[G1610]] the [[G3588]] wheat [[G4621]] with [[G260]] them. [[G846]]

### 30
Let [[G863]] both [[G297]] grow together [[G4885]] until [[G2193]] the [[G3588]] harvest. [[G2326]] At the proper time [[G1722]] I will tell [[G2046]] the [[G3588]] harvesters, [[G2327]] “First [[G4412]] collect [[G4816]] the [[G3588]] weeds [[G2215]] and [[G2532]] tie [[G1210]] them [[G846]] in [[G1519]] bundles [[G1197]] to [[G4314]] be burned; [[G2618]] then [[G1161]] gather [[G4863]] [the] wheat [[G4621]] into [[G1519]] my [[G1473]] barn. [[G596]]

### 31
[Jesus] put before [[G3908]] them [[G846]] another [[G243]] parable: [[G3850]] “The [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] of [[G3588]] heaven [[G3772]] is [[G1510]] like [[G3664]] a mustard [[G4615]] seed [[G2848]] that [[G3739]] a man [[G444]] planted [[G4687]] in [[G1722]] his [[G846]] field. [[G68]]

### 32
Although [[G3303]] it [[G3739]] is [[G1510]] [the] smallest [[G3398]] of all [[G3956]] seeds, [[G4690]] yet [[G1161]] it grows into [[G837]] the largest [[G3173]] of [[G3588]] garden plants [[G3001]] and [[G2532]] becomes [[G1096]] a tree, [[G1186]] so that [[G5620]] the [[G3588]] birds [[G4071]] of the [[G3588]] air [[G3772]] come [[G2064]] and [[G2532]] nest [[G2681]] in [[G1722]] its [[G846]] branches. [[G2798]]

### 33
He told [[G2980]] them [[G846]] still another [[G243]] parable: [[G3850]] “The [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] of [[G3588]] heaven [[G3772]] is [[G1510]] like [[G3664]] yeast [[G2219]] that [[G3739]] a woman [[G1135]] took [and] [[G2983]] mixed [[G1470]] into [[G1519]] three [[G5140]] measures [[G4568]] of flour, [[G224]] until [[G2193]] all [[G3650]] of it [[G3739]] was leavened. [[G2220]]

### 34
Jesus [[G2424]] spoke [[G2980]] all [[G3956]] these things [[G3778]] to the [[G3588]] crowds [[G3793]] in [[G1722]] parables. [[G3850]] He did not tell them anything [[G2980]] without using [[G5565]] a parable. [[G3850]]

### 35
So [[G3704]] was fulfilled [[G4137]] what [[G3588]] was spoken [[G2046]] through [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] prophet: [[G4396]] “I will open [[G455]] My [[G1473]] mouth [[G4750]] in [[G1722]] parables; [[G3850]] I will utter [[G2044]] things hidden [[G2928]] since [[G575]] [the] foundation [[G2602]] [of the] world.” [[G2889]]

### 36
Then [[G5119]] [Jesus] dismissed [[G863]] the [[G3588]] crowds [[G3793]] [and] went [[G2064]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] house. [[G3614]] His [[G846]] disciples [[G3101]] came [[G4334]] to Him [[G846]] [and] said, [[G3004]] “Explain [[G1285]] to us [[G1473]] the [[G3588]] parable [[G3850]] of the [[G3588]] weeds [[G2215]] in the [[G3588]] field. [[G68]]

### 37
He replied, [[G611]] “The [One] [[G3588]] who sows [[G4687]] the [[G3588]] good [[G2570]] seed [[G4690]] is [[G1510]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of Man. [[G444]]

### 38
[The] field [[G68]] is [[G1510]] the [[G3588]] world, [[G2889]] and [[G1161]] [the] good [[G2570]] seed [[G4690]] represents [[G3778]] the [[G3588]] sons [[G5207]] of the [[G3588]] kingdom. [[G932]] [The] weeds [[G2215]] are [[G1510]] the [[G3588]] sons [[G5207]] of the [[G3588]] evil [one], [[G4190]]

### 39
and [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] enemy [[G2190]] who sows [[G4687]] them [[G846]] is [[G1510]] the [[G3588]] devil. [[G1228]] The [[G3588]] harvest [[G2326]] is [[G1510]] [the] end [[G4930]] of the age, [[G165]] and [[G1161]] [the] harvesters [[G2327]] are [[G1510]] angels. [[G32]]

### 40
As [[G5618]] the [[G3588]] weeds [[G2215]] are collected [[G4816]] and [[G2532]] burned [[G2618]] in the fire, [[G4442]] so [[G3779]] will it be [[G1510]] at [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] end [[G4930]] of the [[G3588]] age. [[G165]]

### 41
The [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of Man [[G444]] will send out [[G649]] His [[G846]] angels, [[G32]] and [[G2532]] they will weed [[G4816]] out of [[G1537]] His [[G846]] kingdom [[G932]] every [[G3956]] cause of sin [[G4625]] and [[G2532]] all who [[G3588]] practice [[G4160]] lawlessness. [[G458]]

### 42
And [[G2532]] they will throw [[G906]] them [[G846]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] fiery [[G4442]] furnace, [[G2575]] [where] there [[G1563]] will be [[G1510]] weeping [[G2805]] and [[G2532]] gnashing [[G1030]] of [[G3588]] teeth. [[G3599]]

### 43
Then [[G5119]] the [[G3588]] righteous [[G1342]] will shine [[G1584]] like [[G5613]] the [[G3588]] sun [[G2246]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] of [[G3588]] their [[G846]] Father. [[G3962]] He who [[G3588]] has [[G2192]] ears, [[G3775]] let him hear. [[G191]]

### 44
The [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] of [[G3588]] heaven [[G3772]] is [[G1510]] like [[G3664]] treasure [[G2344]] hidden [[G2928]] in [[G1722]] a field. [[G68]] [When a] man [[G444]] found [[G2147]] [it], [[G3739]] he hid [it again], [[G2928]] and [[G2532]] in [[G575]] [his] [[G3588]] joy [[G5479]] he went [[G5217]] and [[G2532]] sold [[G4453]] all [[G3956]] he had [[G2192]] and [[G2532]] bought [[G59]] that [[G1565]] field. [[G68]]

### 45
Again, [[G3825]] the [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] of [[G3588]] heaven [[G3772]] is [[G1510]] like [[G3664]] a merchant [[G1713]] in search of [[G2212]] fine [[G2570]] pearls. [[G3135]]

### 46
When [[G1161]] he found [[G2147]] one [[G1520]] very precious [[G4186]] pearl, [[G3135]] he went away [[G565]] [and] sold [[G4097]] all [[G3956]] he had [[G2192]] and [[G2532]] bought [[G59]] it. [[G846]]

### 47
Once again, [[G3825]] the [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] of [[G3588]] heaven [[G3772]] is [[G1510]] like [[G3664]] a dragnet [[G4522]] that was cast [[G906]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] sea [[G2281]] and [[G2532]] caught [fish] [[G4863]] of [[G1537]] every [[G3956]] kind. [[G1085]]

### 48
When [[G3753]] it was full, [[G4137]] [the men] pulled [it] [[G307]] ashore. [[G123]] Then [[G2532]] they sat down [[G2523]] [and] sorted [[G4816]] the [[G3588]] good [fish] [[G2570]] into [[G1519]] containers, [[G30]] but [[G1161]] threw [[G906]] the [[G3588]] bad [[G4550]] away. [[G1854]]

### 49
So [[G3779]] will it be [[G1510]] at [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] end [[G4930]] of the [[G3588]] age: [[G165]] The [[G3588]] angels [[G32]] will come [[G1831]] and [[G2532]] separate [[G873]] the [[G3588]] wicked [[G4190]] from [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] righteous, [[G1342]]

### 50
and [[G2532]] throw [[G906]] them [[G846]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] fiery [[G4442]] furnace, [[G2575]] [where] there [[G1563]] will be [[G1510]] weeping [[G2805]] and [[G2532]] gnashing [[G1030]] of [[G3588]] teeth. [[G3599]]

### 51
Have you understood [[G4920]] all [[G3956]] these things?” [[G3778]] “Yes,” [[G3483]] they answered. [[G3004]]

### 52
Then [[G1161]] He told [[G2036]] them, [[G846]] “For this reason, [[G1223]] every [[G3956]] scribe [[G1122]] who has been discipled [[G3100]] in the [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] of [[G3588]] heaven [[G3772]] is [[G1510]] like [[G3664]] a homeowner [[G3617]] who [[G3748]] brings [[G1544]] out of [[G1537]] his [[G846]] storeroom [[G2344]] new [treasures] [[G2537]] as well as [[G2532]] old. [[G3820]]

### 53
When [[G3753]] Jesus [[G2424]] had finished [[G5055]] these [[G3778]] parables, [[G3850]] He withdrew [[G3332]] from that place. [[G1564]]

### 54
Coming [[G2064]] to [[G1519]] His hometown, [[G846]] He taught [[G1321]] [the people] [[G846]] in [[G1722]] their [[G846]] synagogue, [[G4864]] and [[G5620]] they [[G846]] were astonished. [[G1605]] “Where did this man get [[G4159]] such [[G3778]] wisdom [[G4678]] and [[G2532]] miraculous powers?” [[G1411]] they asked. [[G3004]]

### 55
“Is [[G1510]] this [[G3778]] not [[G3756]] the [[G3588]] carpenter’s [[G5045]] son? [[G5207]] Isn’t [[G3756]] His [[G846]] mother’s [[G3384]] name [[G3004]] Mary, [[G3137]] and [aren’t] [[G2532]] His [[G846]] brothers [[G80]] James, [[G2385]] Joseph, [[G2501]] Simon, [[G4613]] and [[G2532]] Judas? [[G2455]]

### 56
Aren’t [[G1510]] all [[G3956]] His [[G846]] sisters [[G79]] with [[G4314]] us [[G1473]] as well? [[G2532]] Where [[G4159]] then [[G3767]] [did] this [man] [[G3778]] [get] all [[G3956]] these things?” [[G3778]]

### 57
