### 1
At that time [[G5119]] the [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] of [[G3588]] heaven [[G3772]] will be like [[G3666]] ten [[G1176]] virgins [[G3933]] who [[G3748]] took [[G2983]] their [[G1438]] lamps [[G2985]] [and] went out [[G1831]] to [[G1519]] meet [[G5222]] the [[G3588]] bridegroom. [[G3566]]

### 2
Five [[G4002]] of [[G1537]] them [[G846]] were [[G1510]] foolish, [[G3474]] and [[G2532]] five [were] [[G4002]] wise. [[G5429]]

### 3
The [[G3588]] foolish [ones] [[G3474]] took [[G2983]] their [[G846]] lamps [[G2985]] [but did not] take along [[G2983]] [any extra] [[G3756]] oil. [[G1637]]

### 4
But [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] wise [ones] [[G5429]] took [[G2983]] oil [[G1637]] in [[G1722]] flasks [[G30]] along with [[G3326]] their [[G1438]] lamps. [[G2985]]

### 5
[When] [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] bridegroom [[G3566]] was delayed, [[G5549]] they all became drowsy [[G3573]] and [[G2532]] fell asleep. [[G2518]]

### 6
At midnight [[G3319]] the cry [[G2906]] went out: [[G1096]] ‘Here is [[G2400]] the [[G3588]] bridegroom! [[G3566]] Come out [[G1831]] to [[G1519]] meet [[G529]] him!’ [[G846]]

### 7
Then [[G5119]] all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] virgins [[G3933]] woke up [[G1453]] and [[G2532]] trimmed [[G2885]] their [[G1438]] lamps. [[G2985]]

### 8
The [[G3588]] foolish ones [[G3474]] said [[G2036]] to the [[G3588]] wise, [[G5429]] ‘Give [[G1325]] us [[G1473]] some of [[G1537]] your [[G4771]] oil; [[G1637]] our [[G1473]] lamps [[G2985]] are going out.’ [[G4570]]

### 9
‘No,’ [[G3756]] said [[G611]] the [[G3588]] wise [ones], [[G5429]] ‘or [[G3379]] there may not be enough [[G714]] for [both] us [[G1473]] and [[G2532]] you. [[G4771]] Instead, [[G3123]] go [[G4198]] to [[G4314]] those who [[G3588]] sell [oil] [[G4453]] and [[G2532]] buy [some] [[G59]] for yourselves.’ [[G1438]]

### 10
But [[G1161]] [while] they [[G846]] were on their way [[G565]] to buy [it], [[G59]] the [[G3588]] bridegroom [[G3566]] arrived. [[G2064]] Those who [[G3588]] were ready [[G2092]] went in [[G1525]] with [[G3326]] him [[G846]] to [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] wedding banquet, [[G1062]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] door [[G2374]] was shut. [[G2808]]

### 11
Later [[G5305]] vvv, [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] other [[G3062]] virgins [[G3933]] arrived [[G2064]] and [[G2532]] said, [[G3004]] ‘Lord, [[G2962]] Lord, [[G2962]] open [the door] [[G455]] for us!’ [[G1473]]

### 12
But [[G1161]] he replied, [[G611]] ‘Truly [[G281]] I tell [[G3004]] you, [[G4771]] I do not know [[G1492]] you.’ [[G4771]]

### 13
Therefore [[G3767]] keep watch, [[G1127]] because [[G3754]] you do not know [[G1492]] the [[G3588]] day [[G2250]] [or] [[G3761]] the [[G3588]] hour. [[G5610]]

### 14
For [[G1063]] [it] is just like [[G5618]] a man [[G444]] going on a journey, [[G589]] who called [[G2564]] his [[G2398]] servants [[G1401]] and [[G2532]] entrusted [[G3860]] them [[G846]] with his [[G846]] possessions. [[G5225]]

### 15
To one [[G3739]] he gave [[G1325]] five [[G4002]] talents, [[G5007]] to [another] [[G3739]] two [talents], [[G1417]] and [[G1161]] to [another] [[G3739]] one [talent]— [[G1520]] each [[G1538]] according to [[G2596]] his own [[G2398]] ability. [[G1411]] And [[G2532]] he promptly went on his journey. [[G589]]

### 16
The [servant] [[G3588]] who had received [[G2983]] five [[G4002]] talents [[G5007]] went [[G4198]] [and] put them to work, [[G2038]] and [[G2532]] gained [[G2770]] five [[G4002]] more. [[G243]]

### 17
Likewise, [[G5615]] the [one with] [[G3588]] two [talents] [[G1417]] gained [[G2770]] two [[G1417]] more. [[G243]]

### 18
But [[G1161]] the [servant] [[G3588]] who had received [[G2983]] one [talent] [[G1520]] went off, [[G565]] dug a hole [[G3736]] in the ground, [[G1093]] and [[G2532]] hid [[G2928]] his [[G846]] master’s [[G2962]] money. [[G694]]

### 19
After [[G3326]] a long [[G4183]] time, [[G5550]] the [[G3588]] master [[G2962]] of those [[G1565]] servants [[G1401]] returned [[G2064]] to settle [[G4868]] accounts [[G3056]] with [[G3326]] them. [[G846]]

### 20
The [servant] [[G3588]] who had received [[G2983]] five [[G4002]] talents [[G5007]] came [[G4334]] [and] presented [[G4374]] five [[G4002]] more. [[G243]] ‘Master,’ [[G2962]] he said, [[G3004]] ‘you entrusted [[G3860]] me [[G1473]] {with} five [[G4002]] talents. [[G5007]] See, [[G2400]] I have gained [[G2770]] five [[G4002]] more.’ [[G243]]

### 21
His [[G846]] master [[G2962]] replied, [[G5346]] ‘Well done, [[G2095]] good [[G18]] and [[G2532]] faithful [[G4103]] servant! [[G1401]] You have been [[G1510]] faithful [[G4103]] with [[G1909]] a few things; [[G3641]] I will put [[G2525]] you {in charge} [[G4771]] of [[G1909]] many things. [[G4183]] Enter [[G1525]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] joy [[G5479]] of [[G3588]] your [[G4771]] master! [[G2962]]

### 22
Then [[G1161]] the [servant] [[G3588]] [who had received] [[G3588]] two [[G1417]] talents [[G5007]] also [[G2532]] came [[G4334]] [and] said, [[G2036]] ‘Master, [[G2962]] you entrusted [[G3860]] me [[G1473]] {with} two [[G1417]] talents. [[G5007]] See, [[G2400]] I have gained [[G2770]] two [[G1417]] more.’ [[G243]]

### 23
His [[G846]] master [[G2962]] replied, [[G5346]] ‘Well done, [[G2095]] good [[G18]] and [[G2532]] faithful [[G4103]] servant! [[G1401]] You have been [[G1510]] faithful [[G4103]] with [[G1909]] a few things; [[G3641]] I will put [[G2525]] you {in charge} [[G4771]] of [[G1909]] many things. [[G4183]] Enter [[G1525]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] joy [[G5479]] of [[G3588]] your [[G4771]] master! [[G2962]]

### 24
Finally, [[G1161]] the [servant] [[G3588]] who had received [[G2983]] one [[G1520]] talent [[G5007]] came [[G4334]] and [[G2532]] said, [[G2036]] ‘Master, [[G2962]] I knew [[G1097]] that [[G3754]] you are [[G1510]] a hard [[G4642]] man, [[G444]] reaping [[G2325]] where [[G3699]] you have not sown, [[G4687]] and [[G2532]] gathering [[G4863]] where [[G3606]] you have not scattered seed. [[G1287]]

### 25
So [[G2532]] in my fear, [[G5399]] I went [and] [[G565]] hid [[G2928]] your [[G4771]] talent [[G5007]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] ground. [[G1093]] See, [[G2400]] you have [[G2192]] what [belongs] [[G3588]] to you.’ [[G4674]]

### 26
‘You wicked, [[G4190]] lazy [[G3636]] servant!’ [[G1401]] replied [[G611]] his [[G846]] master. [[G2962]] ‘You knew [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] I reap [[G2325]] where [[G3699]] I have not sown [[G4687]] and [[G2532]] gather [[G4863]] where [[G3606]] I have not scattered seed. [[G1287]]

### 27
Then [[G3767]] you [[G4771]] should [[G1163]] have deposited [[G906]] my [[G1473]] money [[G694]] with the [[G3588]] bankers, [[G5133]] and [[G2532]] on my return [[G2064]] I would have received [[G2865]] it {back} [[G1699]] with [[G4862]] interest. [[G5110]]

### 28
Therefore [[G3767]] take [[G142]] the [[G3588]] talent [[G5007]] from [[G575]] him [[G846]] and [[G2532]] give [it] [[G1325]] to the [one] [[G3588]] who has [[G2192]] ten [[G1176]] talents. [[G5007]]

### 29
For [[G1063]] everyone [[G3956]] who has [[G2192]] will be given [more], [[G1325]] and [he] [[G2532]] will have an abundance. [[G4052]] But [[G1161]] the [one who] [[G3588]] {does} not [[G3361]] have, [[G2192]] even [[G2532]] what [[G3739]] he has [[G2192]] will be taken away [[G142]] from [[G575]] him. [[G846]]

### 30
And [[G2532]] throw [[G1544]] that [[G3588]] worthless [[G888]] servant [[G1401]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] outer [[G1857]] darkness, [[G4655]] [where] there [[G1563]] will be [[G1510]] weeping [[G2805]] and [[G2532]] gnashing [[G1030]] of [[G3588]] teeth.’ [[G3599]]

### 31
When [[G3752]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of Man [[G444]] comes [[G2064]] in [[G1722]] His [[G846]] glory, [[G1391]] and [[G2532]] all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] angels [[G32]] with [[G3326]] Him, [[G846]] He will sit [[G2523]] on [[G1909]] His [[G846]] glorious [[G1391]] throne. [[G2362]]

### 32
All [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] nations [[G1484]] will be gathered [[G4863]] before [[G1715]] Him, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] He will separate [[G873]] [the people] [[G846]] one from another, [[G240]] as [[G5618]] a shepherd [[G4166]] separates [[G873]] the [[G3588]] sheep [[G4263]] from [[G575]] the [[G3588]] goats. [[G2056]]

### 33
He will place [[G2476]] the [[G3588]] sheep [[G4263]] on [[G1537]] His [[G846]] right [[G1188]] and [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] goats [[G2055]] on [[G1537]] [His] left. [[G2176]]

### 34
Then [[G5119]] the [[G3588]] King [[G935]] will say [[G2046]] to those [[G3588]] on [[G1537]] His [[G846]] right, [[G1188]] ‘Come, [[G1205]] you who are [[G3588]] blessed [[G2127]] by [[G3588]] My [[G1473]] Father, [[G3962]] inherit [[G2816]] the [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] prepared [[G2090]] for you [[G4771]] from [[G575]] [the] foundation [[G2602]] of [the] world. [[G2889]]

### 35
For [[G1063]] I was hungry [[G3983]] and [[G2532]] you gave [[G1325]] Me [[G1473]] [something] to eat, [[G5315]] I was thirsty [[G1372]] and [[G2532]] you gave Me [something] to drink, [[G4222]] I was [[G1510]] a stranger [[G3581]] and [[G2532]] you took Me in, [[G4863]]

### 36
[I was] naked [[G1131]] and [[G2532]] you clothed [[G4016]] Me, [[G1473]] I was sick [[G770]] and [[G2532]] you looked after [[G1980]] Me, [[G1473]] I was [[G1510]] in [[G1722]] prison [[G5438]] and [[G2532]] you visited [[G2064]] Me.’ [[G1473]]

### 37
Then [[G5119]] the [[G3588]] righteous [[G1342]] will answer [[G611]] Him, [[G846]] ‘Lord, [[G2962]] when [[G4219]] did we see [[G3708]] You [[G4771]] hungry [[G3983]] and [[G2532]] feed [You], [[G5142]] or [[G2228]] thirsty [[G1372]] and [[G2532]] give [You] something to drink? [[G4222]]

### 38
When [[G4219]] did we see [[G3708]] You [[G4771]] a stranger [[G3581]] and [[G2532]] take [You] in, [[G4863]] or [[G2228]] naked [[G1131]] and [[G2532]] clothe [You]? [[G4016]]

### 39
When [[G4219]] did we see [[G3708]] You [[G4771]] sick [[G770]] or [[G2228]] in [[G1722]] prison [[G5438]] and [[G2532]] visit [[G2064]] You?’ [[G4771]]

### 40
And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] King [[G935]] will reply, [[G2046]] ‘Truly [[G281]] I tell [[G3004]] you, [[G4771]] whatever [[G1909]] you did [[G4160]] for one [[G1520]] of the [[G3588]] least [[G1646]] of these [[G3778]] brothers [[G80]] of Mine, [[G1473]] you did [[G4160]] for Me.’ [[G1473]]

### 41
Then [[G5119]] He will say [[G2046]] to those [[G3588]] on [[G1537]] [His] left, [[G2176]] ‘Depart [[G4198]] from [[G575]] Me, [[G1473]] [you] who [[G3588]] are cursed, [[G2672]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] eternal [[G166]] fire [[G4442]] prepared [[G2090]] for the [[G3588]] devil [[G1228]] and [[G2532]] his [[G846]] angels. [[G32]]

### 42
For [[G1063]] I was hungry [[G3983]] and [[G2532]] you gave [[G1325]] Me [[G1473]] nothing [[G3756]] to eat, [[G5315]] I was thirsty [[G1372]] and [[G2532]] you gave Me nothing to drink, [[G4222]]

### 43
I was [[G1510]] a stranger [[G3581]] and [[G2532]] you did not take Me in, [[G4863]] [I was] naked [[G1131]] and [[G2532]] you did not clothe [[G4016]] Me, [[G1473]] [I was] sick [[G772]] and [[G2532]] in [[G1722]] prison [[G5438]] and [[G2532]] you did not visit [[G1980]] Me.’ [[G1473]]

### 44
And [[G5119]] they [[G846]] too [[G2532]] will reply, [[G611]] ‘Lord, [[G2962]] when [[G4219]] did we see [[G3708]] You [[G4771]] hungry [[G3983]] or [[G2228]] thirsty [[G1372]] or [[G2228]] a stranger [[G3581]] or [[G2228]] naked [[G1131]] or [[G2228]] sick [[G772]] or [[G2228]] in [[G1722]] prison, [[G5438]] and [[G2532]] did not minister [[G1247]] to You? [[G4771]]

### 45
Then [[G5119]] [the King] will answer, [[G611]] ‘Truly [[G281]] I tell [[G3004]] you, [[G4771]] whatever [[G1909]] you did not do [[G4160]] for one [[G1520]] of the [[G3588]] least [[G1646]] of these, [[G3778]] you did not do [[G4160]] for Me.’ [[G1473]]

### 46
And [[G2532]] they [[G3778]] will go away [[G565]] into [[G1519]] eternal [[G166]] punishment, [[G2851]] but [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] righteous [[G1342]] into [[G1519]] eternal [[G166]] life.” [[G2222]]
