### 1
At [[G1722]] that [[G1565]] time [[G2540]] Herod [[G2264]] the [[G3588]] tetrarch [[G5076]] heard [[G191]] the [[G3588]] reports [[G189]] about Jesus [[G2424]]

### 2
and [[G2532]] said [[G2036]] to [[G3588]] his [[G846]] servants, [[G3816]] “This [[G3778]] is [[G1510]] John [[G2491]] the [[G3588]] Baptist; [[G910]] he [[G846]] has risen [[G1453]] from [[G575]] the [[G3588]] dead! [[G3498]] This [[G3778]] is why [[G1223]] miraculous powers [[G1411]] are at work [[G1754]] in [[G1722]] him. [[G846]]

### 3
[Now] [[G1063]] Herod [[G2264]] had arrested [[G2902]] John [[G2491]] [and] bound [[G1210]] him [[G846]] and [[G2532]] put [him] [[G659]] in [[G1722]] prison [[G5438]] on account of [[G1223]] Herodias, [[G2266]] his [[G846]] brother [[G80]] Philip’s [[G5376]] wife, [[G1135]]

### 4
because [[G1063]] John [[G2491]] had been telling [[G2036]] him, [[G846]] “It is not lawful [[G1832]] for you [[G4771]] to have [[G2192]] her.” [[G846]]

### 5
Although [[G2532]] [Herod] wanted [[G2309]] to kill [[G615]] [John], [[G846]] he was afraid [[G5399]] of the [[G3588]] people, [[G3793]] because [[G3754]] they considered [[G2192]] him [[G846]] a prophet. [[G4396]]

### 6
On [[G3588]] Herod’s [[G2264]] birthday, [[G1077]] however, [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] daughter [[G2364]] of Herodias [[G2266]] danced [[G3738]] before them, [[G1722]] and [[G2532]] pleased [[G700]] Herod [[G2264]]

### 7
so much that [[G3606]] he promised [[G3670]] with [[G3326]] an oath [[G3727]] to give [[G1325]] to her [[G846]] whatever [[G3739]] she asked. [[G154]]

### 8
Prompted [[G4264]] by [[G5259]] her [[G846]] mother, [[G3384]] she said, [[G5346]] “Give [[G1325]] me [[G1473]] here [[G5602]] on [[G1909]] a platter [[G4094]] the [[G3588]] head [[G2776]] of John [[G2491]] the [[G3588]] Baptist.” [[G910]]

### 9
The [[G3588]] king [[G935]] was grieved, [[G3076]] but because of [[G1223]] [his] [[G3588]] oaths [[G3727]] and [[G2532]] his guests, [[G4873]] he ordered that [[G2753]] [her wish] be granted [[G1325]]

### 10
and [[G2532]] sent {to have} [[G3992]] John [[G2491]] beheaded [[G607]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] prison. [[G5438]]

### 11
[John’s] [[G846]] head [[G2776]] was brought in [[G5342]] on [[G1909]] a platter [[G4094]] and [[G2532]] presented [[G1325]] to the [[G3588]] girl, [[G2877]] [who] carried [it] [[G5342]] to [[G3588]] her [[G846]] mother. [[G3384]]

### 12
Then [[G2532]] [John’s] [[G846]] disciples [[G3101]] came [and] [[G4334]] took [[G142]] [his] [[G3588]] body [[G4430]] and [[G2532]] buried [[G2290]] it. [[G846]] And [[G2532]] they went [[G2064]] [and] informed [[G518]] Jesus. [[G2424]]

### 13
When [[G1161]] Jesus [[G2424]] heard [ about John ], [[G191]] He withdrew [[G402]] by [[G1722]] boat [[G4143]] privately [[G2398]] to [[G1519]] a solitary [[G2048]] place. [[G5117]] But [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] crowds [[G3793]] found out [[G191]] [and] followed [[G190]] Him [[G846]] on foot [[G3979]] from [[G575]] the [[G3588]] towns. [[G4172]]

### 14
When [[G2532]] He stepped ashore [[G1831]] [and] saw [[G3708]] a large [[G4183]] crowd, [[G3793]] He had compassion [[G4697]] on [[G1909]] them [[G846]] and [[G2532]] healed [[G2323]] their [[G846]] sick. [[G732]]

### 15
When [[G1161]] evening [[G3798]] came, [[G1096]] the [[G3588]] disciples [[G3101]] came [[G4334]] to Him [[G846]] [and] said, [[G3004]] “This [[G3588]] is [[G1510]] a desolate [[G2048]] place, [[G5117]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] hour [[G5610]] is already late. [[G2235]] Dismiss [[G630]] the [[G3588]] crowds, [[G3793]] so [[G2443]] they can go [[G565]] to [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] villages [[G2968]] [and] buy [[G59]] food [[G1033]] for themselves. [[G1438]]

### 16
“They do [[G2192]] not [[G3756]] need [[G5532]] to go away,” [[G565]] Jesus [[G2424]] replied. [[G2036]] “You [[G4771]] give [[G1325]] them [[G846]] [something] to eat.” [[G5315]]

### 17
“We have [[G2192]] here [[G5602]] only [[G1487]] five [[G4002]] loaves of bread [[G740]] and [[G2532]] two [[G1417]] fish,” [[G2486]] they answered. [[G3004]]

### 18
“Bring [[G5342]] them [[G846]] here [[G5602]] to Me,” [[G1473]] [Jesus] said. [[G2036]]

### 19
And [[G2532]] He instructed [[G2753]] the [[G3588]] crowds [[G3793]] to sit down [[G347]] on [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] grass. [[G5528]] Taking [[G2983]] the [[G3588]] five [[G4002]] loaves [[G740]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] two [[G1417]] fish [[G2486]] [and] looking up [[G308]] to [[G1519]] heaven, [[G3772]] He spoke a blessing. [[G2127]] Then [[G2532]] He broke [[G2806]] the [[G3588]] loaves [[G740]] [and] gave [them] [[G1325]] to the [[G3588]] disciples, [[G3101]] and [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] disciples [[G3101]] [gave them] to the [[G3588]] people. [[G3793]]

### 20
They all ate [[G5315]] and [[G2532]] were satisfied, [[G5526]] and [[G2532]] [the disciples] picked up [[G142]] twelve [[G1427]] basketfuls [[G2894]] of broken pieces [[G2801]] that [[G3588]] were left over. [[G4052]]

### 21
About [[G5616]] five thousand [[G4000]] men [[G435]] were [[G1510]] fed, [[G2068]] in addition to [[G5565]] women [[G1135]] and [[G2532]] children. [[G3813]]

### 22
Immediately [[G2112]] [Jesus] made [[G315]] the [[G3588]] disciples [[G3101]] get into [[G1684]] the [[G3588]] boat [[G4143]] and [[G2532]] go on ahead of [[G4254]] Him [[G846]] to [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] other side, [[G4008]] while [[G2193]] He dismissed [[G630]] the [[G3588]] crowds. [[G3793]]

### 23
After [[G2532]] He had sent [them] away, [[G630]] He went up [[G305]] on [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] mountain [[G3735]] by [[G2596]] Himself [[G2398]] to pray. [[G4336]] When [[G1161]] evening [[G3798]] came, [[G1096]] He was [[G1510]] there [[G1563]] alone, [[G3441]]

### 24
but [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] boat [[G4143]] was [[G568]] already [[G2235]] far [[G4183]] from [[G575]] land, [[G1093]] buffeted [[G928]] by [[G5259]] the [[G3588]] waves [[G2949]] because [[G1063]] the [[G3588]] wind [[G417]] was [[G1510]] against it. [[G1727]]

### 25
During the fourth [[G5067]] watch [[G5438]] of the [[G3588]] night, [[G3571]] [Jesus] went out [[G2064]] to [[G4314]] them, [[G846]] walking [[G4043]] on [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] sea. [[G2281]]

### 26
When [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] disciples [[G3101]] saw [[G3708]] Him [[G846]] walking [[G4043]] on [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] sea, [[G2281]] they were terrified. [[G5015]] “It’s [[G1510]] a ghost!” [[G5326]] they said, [[G3004]] and [[G2532]] cried out [[G2896]] in [[G575]] fear. [[G5401]]

### 27
But [[G1161]] Jesus [[G2424]] immediately [[G2112]] spoke up: [[G2980]] “Take courage! [[G2293]] It is [[G1510]] I. [[G1473]] [Do] not [[G3361]] be afraid.” [[G5399]]

### 28
“Lord, [[G2962]] if [[G1487]] [it] is [[G1510]] You,” [[G4771]] Peter [[G4074]] replied, [[G611]] “command [[G2753]] me [[G1473]] to come [[G2064]] to [[G4314]] You [[G4771]] on [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] water.” [[G5204]]

### 29
“Come [[G2064]] vvv,” [[G3588]] said [Jesus]. [[G2036]] Then [[G2532]] Peter [[G4074]] got down out [[G2597]] of [[G575]] the [[G3588]] boat, [[G4143]] walked [[G4043]] on [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] water, [[G5204]] and [[G2532]] came [[G2064]] toward [[G4314]] Jesus. [[G2424]]

### 30
But [[G1161]] when he saw [[G991]] the [[G3588]] strength [[G2478]] of the wind, [[G417]] he was afraid, [[G5399]] and [[G2532]] beginning [[G756]] to sink, [[G2670]] cried out, [[G2896]] “Lord, [[G2962]] save [[G4982]] me!” [[G1473]]

### 31
Immediately [[G2112]] Jesus [[G2424]] reached out [[G1614]] [His] [[G3588]] hand [[G5495]] [and] took hold [[G1949]] of [Peter]. [[G846]] “[You] of little faith,” [[G3640]] He said, [[G3004]] “why [[G1519]] did you doubt?” [[G1365]]

### 32
And [[G2532]] when [[G846]] they had climbed back [[G305]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] boat, [[G4143]] the [[G3588]] wind [[G417]] died down. [[G2869]]

### 33
Then [[G1161]] those who [were] [[G3588]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] boat [[G4143]] worshiped [[G4352]] Him, [[G846]] saying, [[G3004]] “Truly [[G230]] You are [[G1510]] the Son [[G5207]] of God!” [[G2316]]

### 34
When [[G2532]] they had crossed over, [[G1276]] they landed [[G2064]] at [[G1519]] Gennesaret. [[G1082]]

### 35
And when [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] men [[G435]] of that [[G1565]] place [[G5117]] recognized [[G1921]] [Jesus], [[G846]] they sent word [[G649]] to [[G1519]] all [[G3650]] the [[G3588]] surrounding region. [[G4066]] [People] brought [[G4374]] all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] sick [[G2560]] to Him, [[G846]]

### 36
and [[G2532]] begged [[G3870]] Him [[G846]] just [[G3440]] to [[G2443]] let them touch [[G680]] the [[G3588]] fringe [[G2899]] of [[G3588]] His [[G846]] cloak. [[G2440]] And [[G2532]] all who [[G3745]] touched [Him] [[G680]] were healed. [[G1295]]
