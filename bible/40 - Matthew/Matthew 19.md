### 1
When [[G3753]] Jesus [[G2424]] had finished [[G5055]] saying these things, [[G3778]] He left [[G3332]] Galilee [[G1056]] and [[G2532]] went [[G2064]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] region [[G3725]] of Judea [[G2449]] beyond [[G4008]] the [[G3588]] Jordan. [[G2446]]

### 2
Large [[G4183]] crowds [[G3793]] followed [[G190]] Him, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] He healed [[G2323]] them [[G846]] there. [[G1563]]

### 3
Then [[G2532]] [some] Pharisees [[G5330]] came [[G4334]] [and] tested [[G3985]] Him [[G846]] by asking [[G3004]] vvv, [[G1487]] “Is it lawful [[G1832]] for a man [[G444]] to divorce [[G630]] his [[G846]] wife [[G1135]] for [[G2596]] any [[G3956]] reason?” [[G156]]

### 4
[Jesus] answered, [[G611]] “Have you not read [[G314]] that [[G3754]] from [[G575]] [the] beginning [[G746]] the [[G3588]] Creator [[G2936]] ‘made [[G4160]] them [[G846]] male [[G730]] and [[G2532]] female’ [[G2338]]

### 5
and [[G2532]] said, [[G2036]] ‘For this reason [[G1752]] a man [[G444]] will leave [[G2641]] [his] [[G3588]] father [[G3962]] and [[G2532]] mother [[G3384]] and [[G2532]] be united to [[G2853]] his [[G846]] wife, [[G1135]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] two [[G1417]] will become [[G1510]] one [[G1520]] flesh’? [[G4561]]

### 6
So [[G5620]] they are [[G1510]] no longer [[G3765]] two, [[G1417]] but [[G235]] one [[G1520]] flesh. [[G4561]] Therefore [[G3767]] what [[G3739]] God [[G2316]] has joined together, [[G4801]] [let] man [[G444]] not [[G3361]] separate.” [[G5563]]

### 7
“Why [[G5101]] then,” [[G3767]] they asked, [[G3004]] “{did} Moses [[G3475]] order [a man] [[G1781]] to give [his wife] [[G1325]] a certificate [[G975]] of divorce [[G647]] and [[G2532]] send [her] away?” [[G630]]

### 8
Jesus answered, [[G3004]] “[It was] because of [[G4314]] your [[G4771]] hardness of heart [[G4641]] [that] Moses [[G3475]] permitted [[G2010]] you [[G4771]] to divorce [[G630]] your [[G4771]] wives; [[G1135]] but [[G1161]] [it] was [[G1096]] not [[G3756]] this way [[G3779]] from [[G575]] [the] beginning. [[G746]]

### 9
Now [[G1161]] I tell [[G3004]] you [[G4771]] that [[G3754]] whoever [[G3739]] divorces [[G630]] his [[G846]] wife, [[G1135]] except [[G3361]] for [[G1909]] sexual immorality, [[G4202]] and [[G2532]] marries [[G1060]] another woman, [[G243]] commits adultery.” [[G3429]]

### 10
His [[G846]] disciples [[G3101]] said [[G3004]] to Him, [[G846]] “If [[G1487]] this [[G3779]] is [[G1510]] the [[G3588]] case [[G156]] between [[G3588]] a man [[G444]] [and] [[G3326]] [his] [[G3588]] wife, [[G1135]] it is better [[G4851]] not [[G3756]] to marry.” [[G1060]]

### 11
“Not [[G3756]] everyone [[G3956]] can accept [[G5562]] this [[G3778]] word,” [[G3056]] [Jesus] answered, [[G2036]] “but only [those] [[G235]] to whom [[G3739]] it has been given. [[G1325]]

### 12
For [[G1063]] there are [[G1510]] eunuchs [[G2135]] who [[G3748]] were born [[G1080]] that way; [[G3779]] [others] [[G2135]] were made [that way] [[G2134]] by [[G5259]] men; [[G444]] and [[G2532]] [still others] [[G2135]] live like eunuchs [[G2134]] for the sake of [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] of [[G3588]] heaven. [[G3772]] The [one] [[G3588]] who can [[G1410]] accept [this] [[G5562]] should accept [it]. [[G5562]]

### 13
Then [[G5119]] [the] little children [[G3813]] were brought [[G4374]] to [Jesus] [[G846]] for [[G2443]] Him to place [[G2007]] [His] hands [[G5495]] on them [[G846]] and [[G2532]] pray [for them]; [[G4336]] and [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] disciples [[G3101]] rebuked [[G2008]] those [who brought them]. [[G846]]

### 14
But [[G1161]] Jesus [[G2424]] said, [[G2036]] “Let [[G863]] the [[G3588]] little children [[G3813]] come [[G2064]] to [[G4314]] Me, [[G1473]] and [[G2532]] do not hinder [[G2967]] them! [[G846]] For [[G1063]] the [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] of [[G3588]] heaven [[G3772]] belongs [[G1510]] to [[G3588]] such as these.” [[G5108]]

### 15
And [[G2532]] after He had placed [[G2007]] [His] [[G3588]] hands [[G5495]] on them, [[G846]] He went on [[G4198]] from there. [[G1564]]

### 16
Just then, [[G2532]] a man [[G1520]] came up [[G4334]] to [Jesus] [[G846]] [and] inquired, [[G2036]] “Teacher, [[G1320]] what [[G5101]] good [thing] [[G18]] must I do [[G4160]] to [[G2443]] obtain [[G2192]] eternal [[G166]] life?” [[G2222]]

### 17
“Why [[G5101]] do you ask [[G2065]] Me [[G1473]] about [[G4012]] what is [[G3588]] good?” [[G18]] [Jesus] replied, [[G2036]] “There is [[G1510]] only One [[G1520]] who is [[G3588]] good. [[G18]] If [[G1487]] you want [[G2309]] to enter [[G1525]] life, [[G2222]] keep [[G5083]] the [[G3588]] commandments.” [[G1785]]

### 18
“Which [ones]?” [[G4169]] [the man] asked. [[G3004]] Jesus [[G2424]] answered, [[G2036]] “‘Do not murder, [[G5407]] do not commit adultery, [[G3431]] do not steal, [[G2813]] do not bear false witness, [[G5576]]

### 19
honor [[G5091]] [your] [[G3588]] father [[G3962]] and [[G2532]] mother, [[G3384]] and [[G2532]] love [[G25]] your [[G4771]] neighbor [[G4139]] as [[G5613]] yourself.’” [[G4572]]

### 20
“All these [[G3956]] I have kept,” [[G5442]] said [[G3004]] the [[G3588]] young man. [[G3495]] “What [[G5101]] do I still lack?” [[G5302]]

### 21
Jesus [[G2424]] told [[G5346]] him, [[G846]] “If [[G1487]] you want [[G2309]] to be [[G1510]] perfect, [[G5046]] go, [[G5217]] sell [[G4453]] your [[G4771]] possessions [[G5225]] and [[G2532]] give [[G1325]] to the [[G3588]] poor, [[G4434]] and [[G2532]] you will have [[G2192]] treasure [[G2344]] in [[G1722]] heaven. [[G3772]] Then [[G2532]] come, [[G1204]] follow [[G190]] Me. [[G1473]]

### 22
[When] [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] young man [[G3495]] heard [[G191]] this, [[G3778]] he went away [[G565]] in sorrow, [[G3076]] because [[G1063]] he [[G1510]] had [[G2192]] great [[G4183]] wealth. [[G2933]]

### 23
Then [[G1161]] Jesus [[G2424]] said [[G2036]] to [[G3588]] His [[G846]] disciples, [[G3101]] “Truly [[G281]] I tell [[G3004]] you, [[G4771]] it is difficult for [[G1423]] a rich man [[G4145]] to enter [[G1525]] the [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] of [[G3588]] heaven. [[G3772]]

### 24
Again [[G3825]] I tell [[G3004]] you, [[G4771]] [it] is [[G1510]] easier for [[G2123]] a camel [[G2574]] to pass [[G1525]] through [[G1223]] [the] eye [[G5169]] of a needle [[G4476]] than for [[G2228]] a rich man [[G4145]] to enter [[G1525]] the [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] of [[G3588]] God.” [[G2316]]

### 25
When [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] disciples [[G3101]] heard this [[G191]] {they were} greatly [[G4970]] astonished [[G1605]] [and] asked, [[G3004]] “Who [[G5101]] then [[G686]] can [[G1410]] be saved?” [[G4982]]

### 26
Jesus [[G2424]] looked at [them] [[G1689]] [and] said, [[G2036]] “With [[G3844]] man [[G444]] this [[G3778]] is [[G1510]] impossible, [[G102]] but [[G1161]] with [[G3844]] God [[G2316]] all things [are] [[G3956]] possible.” [[G1415]]

### 27
“Look,” [[G2400]] Peter [[G4074]] replied, [[G611]] “we [[G1473]] have left [[G863]] everything [[G3956]] to follow [[G190]] You. [[G4771]] What [[G5101]] then [[G686]] will there be [[G1510]] for us?” [[G1473]]

### 28
Jesus [[G2424]] said [[G2036]] to them, [[G846]] “Truly [[G281]] I tell [[G3004]] you, [[G4771]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] renewal of all things, [[G3824]] when [[G3752]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of Man [[G444]] sits [[G2523]] on [[G1909]] His [[G846]] glorious [[G1391]] throne, [[G2362]] you [[G4771]] who [[G3588]] have followed [[G190]] Me [[G1473]] will also sit [[G2521]] on [[G1909]] twelve [[G1427]] thrones, [[G2362]] judging [[G2919]] the [[G3588]] twelve [[G1427]] tribes [[G5443]] of Israel. [[G2474]]

### 29
And [[G2532]] everyone [[G3956]] who [[G3748]] has left [[G863]] houses [[G3614]] or [[G2228]] brothers [[G80]] or [[G2228]] sisters [[G79]] or [[G2228]] father [[G3962]] or [[G2228]] mother [[G3384]] or [[G2228]] wife [[G1135]] or [[G2228]] children [[G5043]] or [[G2228]] fields [[G68]] for the sake of [[G1752]] My [[G1473]] name [[G3686]] will receive [[G2983]] a hundredfold [[G1542]] and [[G2532]] will inherit [[G2816]] eternal [[G166]] life. [[G2222]]

### 30
But [[G1161]] many [[G4183]] [who are] first [[G4413]] will be [[G1510]] last, [[G2078]] and [[G2532]] [the] last [[G2078]] [will be] first. [[G4413]]
