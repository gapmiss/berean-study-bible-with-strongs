She will give birth to [[G5088]] a Son, [[G5207]] and [[G2532]] you shall give [[G2564]] Him [[G846]] the [[G3588]] name [[G3686]] Jesus, [[G2424]] because [[G1063]] He [[G846]] will save [[G4982]] His [[G846]] people [[G2992]] from [[G575]] their [[G846]] sins.” [[G266]]

### 22
All [[G3650]] this [[G3778]] took place [[G1096]] to [[G2443]] fulfill [[G4137]] what [[G3588]] the Lord [[G2962]] had said [[G2046]] through [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] prophet: [[G4396]]

### 23
“Behold, [[G2400]] the [[G3588]] virgin [[G3933]] will be with child [[G2192]] and [[G2532]] will give birth to [[G5088]] a son, [[G5207]] and [[G2532]] they will call [[G2564]] Him [[G846]] Immanuel” [[G1694]] (which [[G3739]] means, [[G1510]] “God [[G2316]] with [[G3326]] us”). [[G1473]]

### 24
When [[G1161]] Joseph [[G2501]] woke up, [[G1453]] he did [[G4160]] as [[G5613]] the [[G3588]] angel [[G32]] of [the] Lord [[G2962]] had commanded [[G4367]] him, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] embraced [[G3880]] [Mary as] [[G3588]] his [[G846]] wife. [[G1135]]

### 25
[But] [[G2532]] he had no union with [[G1097]] her [[G846]] until [[G2193]] she gave birth to [[G5088]] a Son. [[G5207]] And [[G2532]] he gave Him the name [[G2564]] Jesus. [[G2424]]
