### 1
At [[G1722]] that [[G1565]] time [[G2540]] Jesus [[G2424]] went [[G4198]] through [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] grainfields [[G4702]] on the [[G3588]] Sabbath. [[G4521]] His [[G846]] disciples [[G3101]] were hungry [[G3983]] and [[G2532]] began [[G756]] to pick [[G5089]] [the] heads of grain [[G4719]] and [[G2532]] eat [them]. [[G2068]]

### 2
[When] [[G1161]] [the] Pharisees [[G5330]] saw [this], [[G3708]] they said [[G2036]] to Him, [[G846]] “Look, [[G2400]] Your [[G4771]] disciples [[G3101]] are doing [[G4160]] what [[G3739]] is unlawful [[G1832]] on [[G1722]] [the] Sabbath.” [[G4521]]

### 3
[Jesus] replied, [[G2036]] “Have you not read [[G314]] what [[G5101]] David [[G1138]] did [[G4160]] when [[G3753]] {he} and [[G2532]] his companions [[G3588]] were hungry? [[G3983]]

### 4
He entered [[G1525]] the [[G3588]] house [[G3624]] of God, [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] [he and his companions] ate [[G5315]] the [[G3588]] consecrated bread, [[G740]] which [[G3739]] was [[G1510]] not [[G3756]] lawful [[G1832]] for [them] [[G846]] to eat, [[G5315]] but [[G1487]] only [[G3441]] for the [[G3588]] priests. [[G2409]]

### 5
Or [[G2228]] haven’t you read [[G314]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] Law [[G3551]] that [[G3754]] on the [[G3588]] Sabbath [[G4521]] the [[G3588]] priests [[G2409]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] temple [[G2411]] break [[G953]] the [[G3588]] Sabbath [[G4521]] and yet [[G2532]] are [[G1510]] innocent? [[G338]]

### 6
But [[G1161]] I tell [[G3004]] you, [[G4771]] something greater than [[G3173]] the [[G3588]] temple [[G2411]] is [[G1510]] here. [[G5602]]

### 7
If [[G1487]] only [[G1161]] you had known [[G1097]] the meaning of [[G1510]] ‘I desire [[G2309]] mercy, [[G1656]] not [[G3756]] sacrifice,’ [[G2378]] you would not have condemned [[G2613]] the [[G3588]] innocent. [[G338]]

### 8
For [[G1063]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of [[G3588]] Man [[G444]] is [[G1510]] Lord [[G2962]] of the [[G3588]] Sabbath.” [[G4521]]

### 9
Moving on [[G3327]] from there, [[G1564]] [Jesus] entered [[G2064]] their [[G846]] synagogue, [[G4864]]

### 10
and [[G2532]] a man [[G444]] with [[G2192]] a withered [[G3584]] hand [[G5495]] [was there]. [[G2400]] In order to [[G2443]] accuse [[G2723]] [Jesus], [[G846]] they asked [[G1905]] Him, [[G846]] “Is it lawful [[G1832]] to heal [[G2323]] on the [[G3588]] Sabbath?” [[G4521]]

### 11
He replied, [[G2036]] “If [[G1437]] one [[G444]] of [[G1537]] you [[G4771]] has [[G2192]] a [[G1520]] sheep [[G4263]] and [[G2532]] it [[G3778]] falls [[G1706]] into [[G1519]] a pit [[G999]] on the [[G3588]] Sabbath, [[G4521]] will he not take hold of [[G2902]] it [[G846]] and [[G2532]] lift [it] out? [[G1453]]

### 12
How much [[G4214]] more valuable is [[G1308]] a man [[G444]] than a sheep! [[G4263]] Therefore [[G5620]] it is lawful [[G1832]] to do [[G4160]] good [[G2573]] on the [[G3588]] Sabbath.” [[G4521]]

### 13
Then [[G5119]] [Jesus] said [[G3004]] to [[G3588]] [the] man, [[G444]] “Stretch out [[G1614]] your [[G4771]] hand.” [[G5495]] So [[G2532]] he stretched [it] out, [[G1614]] and [[G2532]] it was restored [[G600]] to full use, [[G5199]] just like [[G5613]] the [[G3588]] other. [[G243]]

### 14
But [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] Pharisees [[G5330]] went out [and] [[G1831]] conspired [[G2983]] to [[G3704]] kill [[G622]] [Jesus]. [[G846]]

### 15
Aware of this, [[G1097]] Jesus [[G2424]] withdrew [[G402]] from that place. [[G1564]] Large [[G4183]] crowds [[G3793]] followed [[G190]] Him, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] He healed [[G2323]] them [[G846]] all, [[G3956]]

### 16
warning [[G2008]] them [[G846]] not [[G3361]] to make [[G4160]] Him [[G846]] known. [[G5318]]

### 17
This was [[G2443]] to fulfill [[G4137]] what [[G3588]] was spoken [[G2046]] through [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] prophet [[G4396]] Isaiah: [[G2268]]

### 18
“Here is [[G2400]] My [[G1473]] servant, [[G3816]] whom [[G3739]] I have chosen, [[G140]] My [[G1473]] beloved, [[G27]] in [[G1519]] whom [[G3739]] My [[G1473]] soul [[G5590]] delights. [[G2106]] I will put [[G5087]] My [[G1473]] Spirit [[G4151]] on [[G1909]] Him, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] He will proclaim [[G518]] justice [[G2920]] to the [[G3588]] nations. [[G1484]]

### 19
He will not quarrel [[G2051]] or [[G3761]] cry out; [[G2905]] no [[G3761]] one [[G5100]] will hear [[G191]] His [[G846]] voice [[G5456]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] streets. [[G4113]]

### 20
A bruised [[G4937]] reed [[G2563]] He will not break, [[G2608]] and [[G2532]] a smoldering [[G5188]] wick [[G3043]] He will not extinguish, [[G4570]] till [[G2193]] He leads [[G1544]] justice [[G2920]] to [[G1519]] victory. [[G3534]]

### 21
In [[G3588]] His [[G846]] name [[G3686]] [the] nations [[G1484]] will put their hope.” [[G1679]]

### 22
Then [[G5119]] a demon-possessed man [[G1139]] [who was] blind [[G5185]] and [[G2532]] mute [[G2974]] was brought [[G4374]] to [Jesus], [[G846]] and [[G2532]] He healed [[G2323]] [the man] [[G846]] so that [[G5620]] [he] [[G2974]] could speak [[G2980]] and [[G2532]] see. [[G991]]

### 23
The [[G3588]] crowds [[G3793]] were all amazed [[G1839]] and [[G2532]] asked, [[G2036]] “Could this be [[G1510]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of David?” [[G1138]]

### 24
But when [[G1161]] [the] Pharisees [[G5330]] heard this, [[G191]] they said, [[G2036]] “Only [[G1487]] by [[G1722]] Beelzebul, [[G954]] [the] prince [[G758]] of the [[G3588]] demons, [[G1140]] {does} this [man] [[G3778]] drive out [[G1544]] demons.” [[G1140]]

### 25
Knowing [[G1492]] their [[G846]] thoughts, [[G1761]] [Jesus] said [[G2036]] to them, [[G846]] “Every [[G3956]] kingdom [[G932]] divided [[G3307]] against [[G2596]] itself [[G1438]] will be laid waste, [[G2049]] and [[G2532]] every [[G3956]] city [[G4172]] or [[G2228]] household [[G3614]] divided [[G3307]] against [[G2596]] itself [[G1438]] will not stand. [[G2476]]

### 26
If [[G1487]] Satan [[G4567]] drives out [[G1544]] Satan, [[G4567]] he is divided [[G3307]] against [[G1909]] himself. [[G1438]] How [[G4459]] then [[G3767]] {can} his [[G846]] kingdom [[G932]] stand? [[G2476]]

### 27
And [[G2532]] if [[G1487]] I [[G1473]] drive out [[G1544]] demons [[G1140]] by [[G1722]] Beelzebul, [[G954]] by [[G1722]] whom [[G5101]] {do} your [[G4771]] sons [[G5207]] drive them out? [[G1544]] So then, [[G1223]] they [[G846]] will be [[G1510]] your [[G4771]] judges. [[G2923]]

### 28
But [[G1161]] if [[G1487]] I [[G1473]] drive out [[G1544]] demons [[G1140]] by [[G1722]] [the] Spirit [[G4151]] of God, [[G2316]] then [[G686]] the [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] of God [[G2316]] has come [[G5348]] upon [[G1909]] you. [[G4771]]

### 29
How [[G4459]] can [[G1410]] anyone [[G5100]] enter [[G1525]] a strong [man’s] [[G2478]] house [[G3614]] and [[G2532]] steal [[G726]] his [[G846]] possessions, [[G4632]] unless [[G1437]] {he} first [[G4412]] ties up [[G1210]] the [[G3588]] strong [man]? [[G2478]] Then [[G5119]] he can plunder [[G1283]] his [[G846]] house. [[G3614]]

### 30
He who [[G3588]] is [[G1510]] not [[G3361]] with [[G3326]] Me [[G1473]] is [[G1510]] against [[G2596]] Me, [[G1473]] and [[G2532]] he who [[G3588]] {does} not [[G3361]] gather [[G4863]] with [[G3326]] Me [[G1473]] scatters. [[G4650]]

### 31
Therefore [[G1223]] I tell [[G3004]] you, [[G4771]] every [[G3956]] sin [[G266]] and [[G2532]] blasphemy [[G988]] will be forgiven [[G863]] men, [[G444]] but [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] blasphemy [[G988]] against [[G3588]] [the] Spirit [[G4151]] {will} not [[G3756]] be forgiven. [[G863]]

### 32
Whoever [[G3739]] speaks [[G2036]] a word [[G3056]] against [[G2596]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of Man [[G444]] will be forgiven, [[G863]] but [[G1161]] whoever [[G3739]] speaks [[G2036]] against [[G2596]] the [[G3588]] Holy [[G40]] Spirit [[G4151]] will not be forgiven, [[G863]] [either] [[G3777]] in [[G1722]] this [[G3778]] age [[G165]] [or] [[G3777]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] [one] to come. [[G3195]]

### 33
Make [[G4160]] a [[G3588]] tree [[G1186]] good [[G2570]] and [[G2532]] its [[G846]] fruit [[G2590]] [will be] good, [[G2570]] or [[G2228]] make [[G4160]] a [[G3588]] tree [[G1186]] bad [[G4550]] and [[G2532]] its [[G846]] fruit [[G2590]] [will be] bad; [[G4550]] for [[G1063]] a [[G3588]] tree [[G1186]] is known [[G1097]] by [[G1537]] [its] [[G3588]] fruit. [[G2590]]

### 34
You brood [[G1081]] of vipers, [[G2191]] how [[G4459]] can you [[G1410]] who are [[G1510]] evil [[G4190]] say [[G2980]] anything good? [[G18]] For [[G1063]] out of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] overflow [[G4051]] of the [[G3588]] heart, [[G2588]] the [[G3588]] mouth [[G4750]] speaks. [[G2980]]

### 35
The [[G3588]] good [[G18]] man [[G444]] brings [[G1544]] good things [[G18]] out of [[G1537]] his [[G3588]] good [[G18]] store of treasure, [[G2344]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] evil [[G4190]] man [[G444]] brings [[G1544]] evil things [[G4190]] out of [[G1537]] his [[G3588]] evil [[G4190]] store of treasure. [[G2344]]

### 36
But [[G1161]] I tell [[G3004]] you [[G4771]] that [[G3588]] men [[G444]] will give [[G591]] an account [[G3056]] on [[G1722]] [the] day [[G2250]] of judgment [[G2920]] for [[G3754]] every [[G3956]] careless [[G692]] word [[G4487]] they have spoken. [[G2980]]

### 37
For [[G1063]] by [[G1537]] your [[G4771]] words [[G3056]] you will be acquitted, [[G1344]] and [[G2532]] by [[G1537]] your [[G4771]] words [[G3056]] you will be condemned.” [[G2613]]

### 38
Then [[G5119]] some [[G5100]] of the [[G3588]] scribes [[G1122]] and [[G2532]] Pharisees [[G5330]] said to Him, [[G611]] “Teacher, [[G1320]] we want [[G2309]] to see [[G3708]] a sign [[G4592]] from [[G575]] You.” [[G4771]]

### 39
[Jesus] replied, [[G611]] “A wicked [[G4190]] and [[G2532]] adulterous [[G3428]] generation [[G1074]] demands [[G1934]] a sign, [[G4592]] [but] [[G2532]] none [[G3756]] will be given [[G1325]] it [[G846]] except [[G1487]] the [[G3588]] sign [[G4592]] of the [[G3588]] prophet [[G4396]] Jonah. [[G2495]]

### 40
For [[G1063]] just as [[G5618]] Jonah [[G2495]] was [[G1510]] three [[G5140]] days [[G2250]] and [[G2532]] three [[G5140]] nights [[G3571]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] belly [[G2836]] of the [[G3588]] great fish, [[G2785]] so [[G3779]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of Man [[G444]] will be [[G1510]] three [[G5140]] days [[G2250]] and [[G2532]] three [[G5140]] nights [[G3571]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] heart [[G2588]] of the [[G3588]] earth. [[G1093]]

### 41
The men [[G435]] of Nineveh [[G3536]] will stand [[G450]] at [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] judgment [[G2920]] with [[G3326]] this [[G3778]] generation [[G1074]] and [[G2532]] condemn [[G2632]] it; [[G846]] for [[G3754]] they repented [[G3340]] at [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] preaching [[G2782]] of Jonah, [[G2495]] and [[G2532]] now [[G2400]] [One] greater than [[G4119]] Jonah [[G2495]] is here. [[G5602]]

### 42
The queen [[G938]] of [the] south [[G3558]] will rise [[G1453]] at [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] judgment [[G2920]] with [[G3326]] this [[G3778]] generation [[G1074]] and [[G2532]] condemn [[G2632]] it; [[G846]] for [[G3754]] she came [[G2064]] from [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] ends [[G4009]] of the [[G3588]] earth [[G1093]] to hear [[G191]] the [[G3588]] wisdom [[G4678]] of Solomon, [[G4672]] and [[G2532]] now [[G2400]] [One] greater than [[G4119]] Solomon [[G4672]] is here. [[G5602]]

### 43
When [[G3752]] an [[G3588]] unclean [[G169]] spirit [[G4151]] comes out [[G1831]] of [[G575]] a [[G3588]] man, [[G444]] it passes [[G1330]] through [[G1223]] arid [[G504]] places [[G5117]] seeking [[G2212]] rest [[G372]] and [[G2532]] does not find [it]. [[G2147]]

### 44
Then [[G5119]] it says, [[G3004]] ‘I will return [[G1994]] to [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] house [[G3624]] I left.’ [[G1831]] On its arrival, [[G2064]] it finds [the house] [[G2147]] vacant, [[G4980]] swept clean [[G4563]] and [[G2532]] put in order. [[G2885]]

### 45
Then [[G5119]] it goes [[G4198]] and [[G2532]] brings with it [[G3880]] seven [[G2033]] other [[G2087]] spirits [[G4151]] more evil [[G4190]] than itself, [[G1438]] and [[G2532]] they go in [[G1525]] [and] dwell [[G2730]] there; [[G1563]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] final [plight] [[G2078]] of [[G1565]] that [[G3588]] man [[G444]] is [[G1096]] worse [[G5501]] than the [[G3588]] first. [[G4413]] So [[G3779]] will it be [[G1510]] with this [[G3778]] wicked [[G4190]] generation. [[G1074]]

### 46
While [[G2089]] [Jesus] [[G846]] was still speaking [[G2980]] to the [[G3588]] crowds, [[G3793]] His [[G846]] mother [[G3384]] and [[G2532]] brothers [[G80]] stood [[G2476]] outside, [[G1854]] wanting [[G2212]] to speak [[G2980]] to Him. [[G846]]

### 47
Someone [[G5100]] told [[G2036]] Him, [[G846]] “Look, [[G2400]] Your [[G4771]] mother [[G3384]] and [[G2532]] brothers [[G80]] are standing [[G2476]] outside, [[G1854]] wanting [[G2212]] to speak [[G2980]] to You.” [[G4771]]

### 48
But [[G1161]] [Jesus] replied, [[G2036]] “Who [[G5101]] is [[G1510]] My [[G1473]] mother, [[G3384]] and [[G2532]] who [[G5101]] are [[G1510]] My [[G1473]] brothers?” [[G80]]

### 49
Pointing [[G1614]] to [[G1909]] His [[G846]] disciples, [[G3101]] He said, [[G2036]] “Here are [[G2400]] My [[G1473]] mother [[G3384]] and [[G2532]] My [[G1473]] brothers. [[G80]]

### 50
For [[G1063]] whoever [[G3748]] does [[G4160]] the [[G3588]] will [[G2307]] of My [[G1473]] Father [[G3962]] in [[G1722]] heaven [[G3772]] is [[G1510]] My [[G1473]] brother [[G80]] and [[G2532]] sister [[G79]] and [[G2532]] mother.” [[G3384]]
