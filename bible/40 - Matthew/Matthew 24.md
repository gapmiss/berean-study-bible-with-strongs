[[Matthew 23|←]] • [[Matthew 25|→]]

### 1
[As] [[G2532]] Jesus [[G2424]] left [[G1831]] the [[G3588]] temple [[G2411]] [and] was walking away, [[G4198]] His [[G846]] disciples [[G3101]] came up to [Him] [[G4334]] to point out [[G1925]] [its] [[G2411]] buildings. [[G3619]]

### 2
“Do you see [[G991]] all [[G3956]] these things?” [[G3778]] He replied. [[G2036]] “Truly [[G281]] I tell [[G3004]] you, [[G4771]] not [[G3361]] one stone [[G3037]] here [[G5602]] will be left [[G863]] on [[G1909]] [another]; [[G3037]] [every one] [[G3739]] will be toppled.” [[G2647]]

### 3
[While] [[G1161]] [Jesus] [[G846]] was sitting [[G2521]] on [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] Mount [[G3735]] of Olives, [[G1636]] the [[G3588]] disciples [[G3101]] came to [[G4334]] Him [[G846]] privately. [[G2398]] “Tell [[G2036]] us,” [[G1473]] they said, [[G3004]] “when {will} [[G4219]] all this [[G3778]] happen, [[G1510]] and [[G2532]] what [will be] [[G5101]] the [[G3588]] sign [[G4592]] of Your [[G4674]] coming [[G3952]] and [[G2532]] of the end [[G4930]] of the [[G3588]] age?” [[G165]]

### 4
Jesus [[G2424]] answered, [[G611]] “See to it [[G991]] that no one [[G3361]] deceives [[G4105]] you. [[G4771]]

### 5
For [[G1063]] many [[G4183]] will come [[G2064]] in [[G1909]] My [[G1473]] name, [[G3686]] claiming, [[G3004]] ‘I [[G1473]] am [[G1510]] the [[G3588]] Christ,’ [[G5547]] and [[G2532]] will deceive many. [[G4105]]

### 6
You will [[G3195]] hear of [[G191]] wars [[G4171]] and [[G2532]] rumors [[G189]] of wars, [[G4171]] but see to it [[G3708]] that you are not alarmed. [[G2360]] [These things] [[G1063]] must [[G1163]] happen, [[G1096]] but [[G235]] the [[G3588]] end [[G5056]] is [[G1510]] still to come. [[G3768]]

### 7
Nation [[G1484]] will rise [[G1453]] against [[G1909]] nation, [[G1484]] and [[G2532]] kingdom [[G932]] against [[G1909]] kingdom. [[G932]] There will be [[G1510]] famines [[G3042]] and [[G2532]] earthquakes [[G4578]] in [[G2596]] [various] places. [[G5117]]

### 8
All [[G3956]] these [are] [[G3778]] [the] beginning [[G746]] of birth pains. [[G5604]]

### 9
Then [[G5119]] they will hand [[G3860]] you [[G4771]] over to [[G1519]] be persecuted [[G2347]] and [[G2532]] killed, [[G615]] and [[G2532]] you will be [[G1510]] hated [[G3404]] by [[G5259]] all [[G3956]] nations [[G1484]] on account of [[G1223]] My [[G1473]] name. [[G3686]]

### 10
At that time [[G5119]] many [[G4183]] will fall away [[G4624]] and [[G2532]] will betray [[G3860]] and [[G2532]] hate [[G3404]] one another, [[G240]]

### 11
and [[G2532]] many [[G4183]] false prophets [[G5578]] will arise [[G1453]] and [[G2532]] mislead [[G4105]] many. [[G4183]]

### 12
Because of [[G1223]] the multiplication [[G4129]] of wickedness, [[G458]] the [[G3588]] love [[G26]] of [[G3588]] most [[G4183]] will grow cold. [[G5594]]

### 13
But [[G1161]] the [one who] [[G3588]] perseveres [[G5278]] to [[G1519]] [the] end [[G5056]] will be saved. [[G4982]]

### 14
And [[G2532]] this [[G3778]] gospel [[G2098]] of the [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] will be preached [[G2784]] in [[G1722]] all [[G3650]] the [[G3588]] world [[G3625]] as [[G1519]] a testimony [[G3142]] to all [[G3956]] nations, [[G1484]] and [[G2532]] then [[G5119]] the [[G3588]] end [[G5056]] will come. [[G2240]]

### 15
So [[G3767]] when [[G3752]] you see [[G3708]] standing [[G2476]] in [[G1722]] [the] holy [[G40]] place [[G5117]] ‘the [[G3588]] abomination [[G946]] of desolation,’ [[G2050]] described [[G2046]] by [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] prophet [[G4396]] Daniel [[G1158]] ({let} the [[G3588]] reader [[G314]] understand), [[G3539]]

### 16
then {let} [[G5119]] those [[G3588]] in [[G1722]] Judea [[G2449]] flee [[G5343]] to [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] mountains. [[G3735]]

### 17
[Let no one] [[G3588]] on [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] housetop [[G1430]] come down [[G2597]] to retrieve [[G142]] anything [[G3588]] from [[G1537]] his [[G846]] house. [[G3614]]

### 18
And [[G2532]] [let no one] [[G3588]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] field [[G68]] return [[G1994]] for [[G142]] his [[G846]] cloak. [[G2440]]

### 19
How [[G1161]] miserable [[G3759]] those [[G1565]] days [will be] [[G2250]] for [[G3588]] pregnant [[G2192]] and [[G2532]] nursing [mothers]! [[G2337]]

### 20
Pray [[G4336]] that [[G2443]] your [[G4771]] flight [[G5437]] will not occur [[G1096]] in the winter [[G5494]] [or] [[G3366]] on the Sabbath. [[G4521]]

### 21
For [[G1063]] at that time [[G5119]] there will be [[G1510]] great [[G3173]] tribulation, [[G2347]] unmatched [[G3634]] from [[G575]] [the] beginning [[G746]] of [the] world [[G2889]] until [[G2193]] now, [[G3568]] [and] [[G3761]] never [[G3756]] to be [seen again]. [[G1096]]

### 22
If [[G1487]] those [[G1565]] days [[G2250]] had not been cut short, [[G2856]] nobody [[G3956]] would be saved. [[G4982]] But [[G1161]] for the sake of [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] elect, [[G1588]] those [[G1565]] days [[G2250]] will be shortened. [[G2856]]

### 23
At that time, [[G5119]] if [[G1437]] anyone [[G5100]] says [[G2036]] to you, [[G4771]] ‘Look, [[G2400]] here [is] [[G5602]] the [[G3588]] Christ!’ [[G5547]] or [[G2228]] ‘There [He is],’ [[G5602]] {do} not [[G3361]] believe [it]. [[G4100]]

### 24
For [[G1063]] false Christs [[G5580]] and [[G2532]] false prophets [[G5578]] will appear [[G1453]] and [[G2532]] perform [[G1325]] great [[G3173]] signs [[G4592]] and [[G2532]] wonders [[G5059]] that [[G5620]] would deceive [[G4105]] even [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] elect, [[G1588]] if [[G1487]] that were possible. [[G1415]]

### 25
See, [[G2400]] I have told you in advance. [[G4302]]

### 26
So [[G3767]] if [[G1437]] they tell [[G2036]] you, [[G4771]] ‘There [[G2400]] He is [[G1510]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] wilderness,’ [[G2048]] {do} not [[G3361]] go out; [[G1831]] [or], ‘Here [[G2400]] [He is] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] inner rooms,’ [[G5009]] {do} not [[G3361]] believe [it]. [[G4100]]

### 27
For [[G1063]] just as [[G5618]] the [[G3588]] lightning [[G796]] comes [[G1831]] from [[G575]] [the] east [[G395]] and [[G2532]] flashes [[G5316]] as far as [[G2193]] [the] west, [[G1424]] so [[G3779]] will be [[G1510]] the [[G3588]] coming [[G3952]] of the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of Man. [[G444]]

### 28
Wherever [[G3699]] there is [[G1510]] a carcass, [[G4430]] there [[G1563]] the [[G3588]] vultures [[G105]] will gather. [[G4863]]

### 29
Immediately [[G2112]] after [[G3326]] the [[G3588]] tribulation [[G2347]] of those [[G1565]] days: [[G2250]] ‘The [[G3588]] sun [[G2246]] will be darkened, [[G4654]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] moon [[G4582]] will not give [[G1325]] its [[G846]] light; [[G5338]] the [[G3588]] stars [[G792]] will fall [[G4098]] from [[G575]] the [[G3588]] sky, [[G3772]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] powers [[G1411]] of the [[G3588]] heavens [[G3772]] will be shaken. [[G4531]]

### 30
At that time [[G5119]] the [[G3588]] sign [[G4592]] of the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of Man [[G444]] will appear [[G5316]] in [[G1722]] heaven, [[G3772]] and [[G2532]] all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] tribes [[G5443]] of the [[G3588]] earth [[G1093]] will mourn. [[G2875]] They will see [[G3708]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of Man [[G444]] coming [[G2064]] on [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] clouds [[G3507]] of heaven, [[G3772]] with [[G3326]] power [[G1411]] and [[G2532]] great [[G4183]] glory. [[G1391]]

### 31
And [[G2532]] He will send out [[G649]] His [[G846]] angels [[G32]] with [[G3326]] a loud [[G3173]] trumpet call, [[G4536]] and [[G2532]] they will gather [[G1996]] His [[G846]] elect [[G1588]] from [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] four [[G5064]] winds, [[G417]] from [[G575]] one end [[G206]] of the heavens [[G3772]] to [[G2193]] the [[G3588]] [other]. [[G206]]

### 32
Now [[G1161]] learn [[G3129]] this [[G3588]] lesson [[G3850]] from [[G575]] the [[G3588]] fig tree: [[G4808]] As soon as [[G3752]] its [[G846]] branches [[G2798]] become [[G1096]] tender [[G527]] and [[G2532]] sprout [[G1631]] leaves, [[G5444]] you know [[G1097]] that [[G3754]] summer [[G2330]] [is] near. [[G1451]]

### 33
So [[G3779]] also, [[G2532]] when [[G3752]] you see [[G3708]] all [[G3956]] these things, [[G3778]] you [[G4771]] know [[G1097]] that [[G3754]] He is [[G1510]] near, [[G1451]] right at [[G1909]] [the] door. [[G2374]]

### 34
Truly [[G281]] I tell [[G3004]] you, [[G4771]] this [[G3778]] generation [[G1074]] {will} not [[G3756]] pass away [[G3928]] until [[G2193]] all [[G3956]] these things [[G3778]] have happened. [[G1096]]

### 35
Heaven [[G3772]] and [[G2532]] earth [[G1093]] will pass away, [[G3928]] but [[G1161]] My [[G1473]] words [[G3056]] {will} never [[G3756]] pass away. [[G3928]]

### 36
No one [[G3762]] knows [[G1492]] about [[G4012]] that [[G1565]] day [[G2250]] [or] [[G2532]] hour, [[G5610]] not even [[G3761]] the [[G3588]] angels [[G32]] in heaven, [[G3772]] nor [[G3761]] the [[G3588]] Son, [[G5207]] but [[G1487]] only [[G3441]] the [[G3588]] Father. [[G3962]]

### 37
As [it was] [[G5618]] in the [[G3588]] days [[G2250]] of [[G3588]] Noah, [[G3575]] so [[G3779]] will it be [[G1510]] at the [[G3588]] coming [[G3952]] of the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of Man. [[G444]]

### 38
For [[G1063]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] days [[G2250]] before [[G4253]] the [[G3588]] flood, [[G2627]] [people] were [[G1510]] eating [[G5176]] and [[G2532]] drinking, [[G4095]] marrying [[G1060]] and [[G2532]] giving in marriage, [[G1061]] up to [[G891]] the [[G3739]] day [[G2250]] Noah [[G3575]] entered [[G1525]] the [[G3588]] ark. [[G2787]]

### 39
And [[G2532]] they were oblivious, [[G1097]] until [[G2193]] the [[G3588]] flood [[G2627]] came [[G2064]] and [[G2532]] swept them all away. [[G142]] So [[G3779]] will it be [[G1510]] [at] the [[G3588]] coming [[G3952]] of the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of Man. [[G444]]

### 40
Two [men] [[G1417]] will be [[G1510]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] field: [[G68]] one [[G1520]] will be taken [[G3880]] and [[G2532]] [the other] [[G1520]] left. [[G863]]

### 41
Two [women] [[G1417]] will be grinding [[G229]] at [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] mill: [[G3458]] one [[G1520]] will be taken [[G3880]] and [[G2532]] [the other] [[G1520]] left. [[G863]]

### 42
Therefore [[G3767]] keep watch, [[G1127]] because [[G3754]] you do not know [[G1492]] [the] day [[G2250]] on which [[G4169]] your [[G4771]] Lord [[G2962]] will come. [[G2064]]

### 43
But [[G1161]] understand [[G1097]] this: [[G1565]] If [[G1487]] the [[G3588]] owner of the house [[G3617]] had known [[G1492]] in which [[G4169]] watch of the night [[G5438]] the [[G3588]] thief [[G2812]] was coming, [[G2064]] he would have kept watch [[G1127]] and [[G2532]] {would} not [[G3756]] have let [[G1439]] his [[G846]] house [[G3614]] be broken into. [[G1358]]

### 44
For this reason, [[G1223]] you [[G4771]] also [[G2532]] must be [[G1096]] ready, [[G2092]] because [[G3754]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of Man [[G444]] will come [[G2064]] at [[G3739]] an hour [when] [[G5610]] you do not expect [Him]. [[G1380]]

### 45
Who [[G5101]] then [[G686]] is [[G1510]] the [[G3588]] faithful [[G4103]] and [[G2532]] wise [[G5429]] servant, [[G1401]] whom [[G3739]] the [[G3588]] master [[G2962]] has put in charge [[G2525]] of [[G1909]] his [[G846]] household, [[G3610]] to give [[G1325]] [the others] [[G846]] [their] [[G3588]] food [[G5160]] at [[G1722]] the proper time? [[G2540]]

### 46
Blessed [is] [[G3107]] that [[G1565]] servant [[G1401]] whose [[G3739]] master [[G2962]] returns [[G2064]] [and] finds [[G2147]] him doing [[G4160]] [his job]. [[G3779]]

### 47
Truly [[G281]] I tell [[G3004]] you, [[G4771]] he will put [[G2525]] him [[G846]] {in charge} of [[G1909]] all [[G3956]] his [[G846]] possessions. [[G5225]]

### 48
But [[G1161]] suppose [[G1437]] that [[G1565]] servant [[G1401]] [is] wicked [[G2556]] [and] says [[G2036]] in [[G1722]] his [[G846]] heart, [[G2588]] ‘My [[G1473]] master [[G2962]] will be away a long time.’ [[G5549]]

### 49
And [[G2532]] he begins [[G756]] to beat [[G5180]] his [[G846]] fellow servants [[G4889]] and [[G1161]] to eat [[G2068]] and [[G2532]] drink [[G4095]] with [[G3326]] drunkards. [[G3184]]

### 50
The [[G3588]] master [[G2962]] of that [[G1565]] servant [[G1401]] will come [[G2240]] on [[G1722]] a day [[G2250]] he does not anticipate [[G4328]] and [[G2532]] at [[G1722]] an hour [[G5610]] he does not expect. [[G1097]]

### 51
Then [[G2532]] he will cut him to pieces [[G1371]] and [[G2532]] assign [[G5087]] him [[G846]] a place [[G3313]] with [[G3326]] the [[G3588]] hypocrites, [[G5273]] [where] there [[G1563]] will be [[G1510]] weeping [[G2805]] and [[G2532]] gnashing [[G1030]] of [[G3588]] teeth. [[G3599]]
