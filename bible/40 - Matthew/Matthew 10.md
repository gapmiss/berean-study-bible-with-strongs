### 1
And [[G2532]] calling [[G4341]] His [[G846]] twelve [[G1427]] disciples {to Him}, [[G3101]] [Jesus] gave [[G1325]] them [[G846]] authority over [[G1849]] unclean [[G169]] spirits, [[G4151]] so that [[G5620]] they could drive them out [[G1544]] and [[G2532]] heal [[G2323]] every [[G3956]] disease [[G3554]] and [[G2532]] sickness. [[G3119]]

### 2
These [[G3778]] are [[G1510]] the [[G3588]] names [[G3686]] of the [[G3588]] twelve [[G1427]] apostles: [[G652]] first [[G4413]] Simon, [[G4613]] called [[G3004]] Peter, [[G4074]] and [[G2532]] his [[G846]] brother [[G80]] Andrew; [[G406]] James [[G2385]] [son] [[G3588]] of [[G3588]] Zebedee, [[G2199]] and [[G2532]] his [[G846]] brother [[G80]] John; [[G2491]]

### 3
Philip [[G5376]] and [[G2532]] Bartholomew; [[G918]] Thomas [[G2381]] and [[G2532]] Matthew [[G3156]] the [[G3588]] tax collector; [[G5057]] James [[G2385]] [son] [[G3588]] of Alphaeus, [[G256]] and [[G2532]] Thaddaeus; [[G2280]]

### 4
Simon [[G4613]] the [[G3588]] Zealot, [[G2581]] and [[G2532]] Judas [[G2455]] Iscariot, [[G2469]] who [[G3588]] betrayed [[G3860]] [Jesus]. [[G846]]

### 5
These [[G3778]] twelve [[G1427]] Jesus [[G2424]] sent out [[G649]] with [the following] [[G3004]] instructions: [[G3853]] “Do not [[G3361]] go [[G565]] onto [[G1519]] the road [[G3598]] of the Gentiles [[G1484]] [or] [[G2532]] enter [[G3361]] any town [[G4172]] of [the] Samaritans. [[G4541]]

### 6
Go [[G4198]] rather [[G3123]] to [[G4314]] the [[G3588]] lost [[G622]] sheep [[G4263]] of Israel. [[G2474]]

### 7
As [[G1161]] you go, [[G4198]] preach [[G2784]] this message: [[G3004]] ‘The [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] of [[G3588]] heaven [[G3772]] is near.’ [[G1448]]

### 8
Heal [[G2323]] the sick, [[G770]] raise [[G1453]] [the] dead, [[G3498]] cleanse [[G2511]] [the] lepers, [[G3015]] drive out [[G1544]] demons. [[G1140]] Freely [[G1432]] you have received; [[G2983]] freely [[G1432]] give. [[G1325]]

### 9
{Do} not [[G3361]] carry [[G2932]] [any] gold [[G5557]] or [[G3366]] silver [[G696]] or [[G3366]] copper [[G5475]] in [[G1519]] your [[G4771]] belts. [[G2223]]

### 10
[Take] no [[G3361]] bag [[G4082]] for [[G1519]] [the] road, [[G3598]] or [[G3366]] second [[G1417]] tunic, [[G5509]] or [[G3366]] sandals, [[G5266]] or [[G3366]] staff; [[G4464]] for [[G1063]] the [[G3588]] worker [[G2040]] [is] worthy [[G514]] of [[G3588]] his [[G846]] provisions. [[G5160]]

### 11
Whatever [[G3739]] town [[G4172]] or [[G2228]] village [[G2968]] you enter, [[G1525]] find out [[G1833]] who [[G5101]] is [[G1510]] worthy [[G514]] [and] stay [[G3306]] [at his house] [[G2546]] until [[G2193]] you move on. [[G1831]]

### 12
As [[G1161]] you enter [[G1525]] the [[G3588]] house, [[G3614]] greet [[G782]] its [occupants]. [[G846]]

### 13
If [[G1437]] the [[G3588]] home [[G3614]] is [[G1510]] worthy, [[G514]] {let} your [[G4771]] peace [[G1515]] rest [[G2064]] on [[G1909]] it; [[G846]] if [[G1437]] it is [[G1510]] not, [[G3361]] {let} your [[G4771]] peace [[G1515]] return [[G1994]] to [[G4314]] you. [[G4771]]

### 14
And [[G2532]] if anyone [[G3739]] will not welcome [[G1209]] you [[G4771]] or [[G3366]] heed [[G191]] your [[G4771]] words, [[G3056]] shake [[G1621]] the [[G3588]] dust [[G2868]] off [[G3588]] your [[G4771]] feet [[G4228]] when you leave [[G1831]] that [[G1565]] home [[G3614]] or [[G2228]] town. [[G4172]]

### 15
Truly [[G281]] I tell [[G3004]] you, [[G4771]] it will be [[G1510]] more bearable [[G414]] for Sodom [[G4670]] and [[G2532]] Gomorrah [[G1116]] on [[G1722]] [the] day [[G2250]] of judgment [[G2920]] than [[G2228]] for that [[G1565]] town. [[G4172]]

### 16
Look, [[G2400]] I [[G1473]] am sending you out [[G649]] like [[G5613]] sheep [[G4263]] among [[G1722]] wolves; [[G3074]] therefore [[G3767]] be [[G1096]] as shrewd [[G5429]] as [[G5613]] snakes [[G3789]] and [[G2532]] as innocent [[G185]] as [[G5613]] doves. [[G4058]]

### 17
But [[G1161]] beware [[G4337]] of [[G575]] men; [[G444]] for [[G1063]] they will hand you over [[G3860]] to [[G1519]] [their] councils [[G4892]] and [[G2532]] flog [[G3146]] you [[G4771]] in [[G1722]] their [[G846]] synagogues. [[G4864]]

### 18
On My account, [[G1752]] you will be brought [[G71]] before [[G1909]] governors [[G2232]] and [[G2532]] kings [[G935]] as [[G1519]] witnesses [[G3142]] to them [[G846]] and [[G2532]] to the [[G3588]] Gentiles. [[G1484]]

### 19
But [[G1161]] when [[G3752]] they hand you over, [[G3860]] [do] not [[G3361]] worry about [[G3309]] how [to respond] [[G4459]] or [[G2228]] what [[G5101]] to say. [[G2980]] In [[G1722]] that [[G1565]] hour [[G5610]] you [[G4771]] will be given [[G1325]] what [[G5101]] to say. [[G2980]]

### 20
For [[G1063]] it will not be [[G1510]] you [[G4771]] speaking, [[G2980]] but [[G235]] the [[G3588]] Spirit [[G4151]] of [[G3588]] your [[G4771]] Father [[G3962]] speaking [[G2980]] through [[G1722]] you. [[G4771]]

### 21
Brother [[G80]] will betray [[G3860]] brother [[G80]] to [[G1519]] death, [[G2288]] and [[G2532]] a father [[G3962]] [his] child; [[G5043]] children [[G5043]] will rise [[G1881]] against [[G1909]] [their] parents [[G1118]] and [[G2532]] have them put to death. [[G2289]]

### 22
You will be [[G1510]] hated [[G3404]] by [[G5259]] everyone [[G3956]] on account of [[G1223]] My [[G1473]] name, [[G3686]] but [[G1161]] the [one who] [[G3588]] perseveres [[G5278]] to [[G1519]] [the] end [[G5056]] will be saved. [[G4982]]

### 23
When [[G3752]] they persecute [[G1377]] you [[G4771]] in [[G1722]] one [[G3778]] town, [[G4172]] flee [[G5343]] to [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] next. [[G2087]] Truly [[G281]] I tell [[G3004]] you, [[G4771]] you will not [reach] [[G5055]] [all] the [[G3588]] towns [[G4172]] of [[G3588]] Israel [[G2474]] before [[G2193]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of [[G3588]] Man [[G444]] comes. [[G2064]]

### 24
A disciple [[G3101]] is [[G1510]] not [[G3756]] above [[G5228]] [his] [[G3588]] teacher, [[G1320]] nor [[G3761]] a servant [[G1401]] above [[G5228]] his [[G846]] master. [[G2962]]

### 25
[It is] enough [[G713]] for [[G3588]] a disciple [[G3101]] to [[G2443]] be [[G1096]] like [[G5613]] his [[G846]] teacher, [[G1320]] and [[G2532]] a [[G3588]] servant [[G1401]] like [[G5613]] his [[G846]] master. [[G2962]] If [[G1487]] the [[G3588]] head of the house [[G3617]] has been called [[G1941]] Beelzebul, [[G954]] how much [[G4214]] more [[G3123]] the members [[G3588]] of his [[G846]] household! [[G3615]]

### 26
So [[G3767]] do not be afraid [[G5399]] of them. [[G846]] For [[G1063]] nothing [[G3762]] is [[G1510]] concealed [[G2572]] that [[G3739]] will not be uncovered, [[G601]] or [[G2532]] hidden [[G2927]] that [[G3739]] will not be made known. [[G1097]]

### 27
What [[G3739]] I tell [[G3004]] you [[G4771]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] dark, [[G4653]] speak [[G2036]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] light; [[G5457]] what [[G3739]] is whispered [[G191]] in [[G1519]] [your] [[G3588]] ear, [[G3775]] proclaim [[G2784]] from [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] housetops. [[G1430]]

### 28
Do not be afraid [[G5399]] of [[G575]] those who [[G3588]] kill [[G615]] the [[G3588]] body [[G4983]] but [[G1161]] cannot [[G1410]] kill [[G615]] the [[G3588]] soul. [[G5590]] Instead, [[G3123]] fear [[G5399]] the [One who] [[G3588]] can [[G1410]] destroy [[G622]] both [[G2532]] soul [[G5590]] and [[G2532]] body [[G4983]] in [[G1722]] hell. [[G1067]]

### 29
{Are} not [[G3780]] two [[G1417]] sparrows [[G4765]] sold [[G4453]] for a penny? [[G787]] Yet [[G2532]] not [[G3756]] one [[G1520]] of [[G1537]] them [[G846]] will fall [[G4098]] to [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] ground [[G1093]] apart from the will [[G427]] of your [[G4771]] Father. [[G3962]]

### 30
And [[G1161]] even [[G2532]] the very [[G3588]] hairs [[G2359]] of [[G3588]] your [[G4771]] head [[G2776]] are [[G1510]] all [[G3956]] numbered. [[G705]]

### 31
So [[G3767]] do not be afraid; [[G5399]] you [[G4771]] are worth more [[G1308]] than many [[G4183]] sparrows. [[G4765]]

### 32
Therefore [[G3767]] everyone [[G3956]] who [[G3748]] confesses [[G3670]] Me [[G1473]] before [[G1715]] men, [[G444]] I will also confess [[G3670]] him [[G846]] before [[G1715]] My [[G1473]] Father [[G3962]] in [[G1722]] heaven. [[G3772]]

### 33
But [[G1161]] whoever [[G3748]] denies [[G720]] Me [[G1473]] before [[G1715]] men, [[G444]] I will also deny [[G720]] him [[G846]] before [[G1715]] My [[G1473]] Father [[G3962]] in [[G1722]] heaven. [[G3772]]

### 34
{Do} not [[G3361]] assume [[G3543]] that [[G3754]] I have come [[G2064]] to bring [[G906]] peace [[G1515]] to [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] earth; [[G1093]] I have not come [[G2064]] to bring [[G906]] peace, [[G1515]] but [[G235]] a sword. [[G3162]]

### 35
For [[G1063]] I have come [[G2064]] to turn [[G1369]] ‘A man [[G444]] against [[G2596]] his [[G846]] father, [[G3962]] a daughter [[G2364]] against [[G2596]] her [[G846]] mother, [[G3384]] a daughter-in-law [[G3565]] against [[G2596]] her [[G846]] mother-in-law. [[G3994]]

### 36
A man’s [[G444]] enemies [will be] [[G2190]] the members of his own [[G846]] household.’ [[G3615]]

### 37
Anyone who [[G3588]] loves [[G5368]] [his] father [[G3962]] or [[G2228]] mother [[G3384]] more than [[G5228]] Me [[G1473]] is [[G1510]] not [[G3756]] worthy [[G514]] of Me; [[G1473]] anyone who [[G3588]] loves [[G5368]] [his] son [[G5207]] or [[G2228]] daughter [[G2364]] more than [[G5228]] Me [[G1473]] is [[G1510]] not [[G3756]] worthy [[G514]] of Me; [[G1473]]

### 38
and [[G2532]] anyone who [[G3739]] does not take up [[G2983]] his [[G846]] cross [[G4716]] and [[G2532]] follow [[G190]] Me [[G1473]] is [[G1510]] not [[G3756]] worthy [[G514]] of Me. [[G1473]]

### 39
Whoever [[G3588]] finds [[G2147]] his [[G846]] life [[G5590]] will lose [[G622]] it, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] whoever [[G3588]] loses [[G622]] his [[G846]] life [[G5590]] for My sake [[G1752]] will find [[G2147]] it. [[G846]]

### 40
He who [[G3588]] receives [[G1209]] you [[G4771]] receives [[G1209]] Me, [[G1473]] and [[G2532]] he who [[G3588]] receives [[G1209]] Me [[G1473]] receives [[G1209]] the [One who] [[G3588]] sent [[G649]] Me. [[G1473]]

### 41
Whoever [[G3588]] receives [[G1209]] a prophet [[G4396]] because he is [[G1519]] a prophet [[G4396]] will receive [[G2983]] a prophet’s [[G4396]] reward, [[G3408]] and [[G2532]] whoever [[G3588]] receives [[G1209]] a righteous [man] [[G1342]] because he is [[G1519]] a righteous [man] [[G1342]] will receive [[G2983]] a righteous [man’s] [[G1342]] reward. [[G3408]]

### 42
And [[G2532]] if anyone [[G3739]] gives [[G4222]] even [[G3440]] a cup [[G4221]] of cold [water] [[G5593]] to one [[G1520]] of these [[G3778]] little ones [[G3398]] [because he is My] [[G3686]] disciple, [[G3101]] truly [[G281]] I tell [[G3004]] you, [[G4771]] he will never lose [[G622]] his [[G846]] reward.” [[G3408]]
