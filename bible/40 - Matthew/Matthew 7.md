###### 1
[Do] not [[G3361]] judge, [[G2919]] or [[G2443]] you will be judged. [[G2919]]

###### 2
For [[G1063]] with [[G1722]] the same [[G3739]] judgment [[G2917]] you pronounce, [[G2919]] you will be judged; [[G2919]] and [[G2532]] with [[G1722]] the [[G3739]] measure [[G3358]] you [use], [[G3354]] it will be measured [[G3354]] to you. [[G4771]]

###### 3
Why [[G5101]] do you look at [[G991]] the [[G3588]] speck [[G2595]] in [[G1722]] your [[G4771]] brother’s [[G80]] eye, [[G3788]] but [[G1161]] fail [[G3756]] to notice [[G2657]] [the] beam [[G1385]] in [[G1722]] your [own] [[G4674]] eye? [[G3788]]

###### 4
How [[G4459]] can you say [[G2046]] to [[G3588]] your [[G4771]] brother, [[G80]] ‘Let [[G863]] me take [[G1544]] the [[G3588]] speck [[G2595]] out of [[G1537]] your [[G4771]] eye,’ [[G3788]] while [[G2532]] [there is still] [[G2400]] a beam [[G1385]] in [[G1722]] your [[G4771]] [own] [[G3588]] eye? [[G3788]]

###### 5
You hypocrite! [[G5273]] First [[G4412]] take [[G1544]] the [[G3588]] beam [[G1385]] out of [[G1537]] your [own] [[G4771]] eye, [[G3788]] and [[G2532]] then [[G5119]] you will see clearly [[G1227]] to remove [[G1544]] the [[G3588]] speck [[G2595]] from [[G1537]] your [[G4771]] brother’s [[G80]] eye. [[G3788]]

###### 6
{Do} not [[G3361]] give [[G1325]] dogs [[G2965]] what is [[G3588]] holy; [[G40]] {do} not [[G3366]] throw [[G906]] your [[G4771]] pearls [[G3135]] before [[G1715]] swine. [[G5519]] If you do, [[G4219]] they may trample [[G2662]] them [[G846]] under [[G1722]] their [[G846]] feet, [[G4228]] and [[G2532]] then turn [and] [[G4762]] tear you to pieces. [[G4486]]

###### 7
Ask [[G154]] and [[G2532]] it will be given [[G1325]] to you; [[G4771]] seek [[G2212]] and [[G2532]] you will find; [[G2147]] knock [[G2925]] and [[G2532]] [the door] will be opened [[G455]] to you. [[G4771]]

###### 8
For [[G1063]] everyone [[G3956]] who asks [[G154]] receives; [[G2983]] he who [[G3588]] seeks [[G2212]] finds; [[G2147]] and [[G2532]] to him who [[G3588]] knocks, [[G2925]] [the door] will be opened. [[G455]]

###### 9
Which [[G5101]] of [[G1537]] you, [[G4771]] if his [[G3739]] son [[G5207]] asks for [[G154]] bread, [[G740]] will give [[G1929]] him [[G846]] a stone? [[G3037]]

###### 10
Or [[G2228]] [if] [[G2532]] he asks for [[G154]] a fish, [[G2486]] will give [[G1929]] him [[G846]] a snake? [[G3789]]

###### 11
So [[G3767]] if [[G1487]] you [[G4771]] who are [[G1510]] evil [[G4190]] know how [[G1492]] to give [[G1325]] good [[G18]] gifts [[G1390]] to [[G3588]] your [[G4771]] children, [[G5043]] how much [[G4214]] more [[G3123]] {will} [[G3588]] your [[G4771]] Father [[G3962]] in [[G1722]] heaven [[G3772]] give [[G1325]] good things [[G18]] to those [[G3588]] who ask [[G154]] Him! [[G846]]

###### 12
In everything, [[G3956]] then, [[G3767]] do [[G4160]] to others [[G846]] as [[G3779]] you would have [[G2309]] them do [[G4160]] to you. [[G4771]] For [[G1063]] this [[G3778]] is [the essence of] [[G1510]] the [[G3588]] Law [[G3551]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] prophets. [[G4396]]

###### 13
Enter [[G1525]] through [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] narrow [[G4728]] gate. [[G4439]] For [[G3754]] wide [is] [[G4116]] the [[G3588]] gate [[G4439]] and [[G2532]] broad [is] [[G2149]] the [[G3588]] way [[G3598]] that [[G3588]] leads [[G520]] to [[G1519]] destruction, [[G684]] and [[G2532]] many [[G4183]] enter [[G1525]] through [[G1223]] it. [[G846]]

###### 14
But [[G3754]] small [is] [[G4728]] the [[G3588]] gate [[G4439]] and [[G2532]] narrow [[G2346]] the [[G3588]] way [[G3598]] that [[G3588]] leads [[G520]] to [[G1519]] life, [[G2222]] and [[G2532]] only a few [[G3641]] find [[G2147]] it. [[G846]]

###### 15
Beware [[G4337]] of [[G575]] false prophets. [[G5578]] [They] [[G3748]] come [[G2064]] to [[G4314]] you [[G4771]] in [[G1722]] sheep’s [[G4263]] clothing, [[G1742]] but [[G1161]] inwardly [[G2081]] they are [[G1510]] ravenous [[G727]] wolves. [[G3074]]

###### 16
By [[G575]] their [[G846]] fruit [[G2590]] you will recognize [[G1921]] them. [[G846]] Are grapes gathered [[G4816]] from [[G575]] thornbushes, [[G173]] or [[G2228]] figs [[G4810]] from [[G575]] thistles? [[G5146]]

###### 17
Likewise, [[G3779]] every [[G3956]] good [[G18]] tree [[G1186]] bears [[G4160]] good [[G2570]] fruit, [[G2590]] but [[G1161]] a bad [[G4550]] tree [[G1186]] bears [[G4160]] bad [[G4190]] fruit. [[G2590]]

###### 18
[A] good [[G18]] tree [[G1186]] cannot [[G1410]] bear [[G4160]] bad [[G4190]] fruit, [[G2590]] [and a] bad [[G4550]] tree [[G1186]] cannot [[G3761]] bear [[G4160]] good [[G2570]] fruit. [[G2590]]

###### 19
Every [[G3956]] tree [[G1186]] that does not bear [[G4160]] good [[G2570]] fruit [[G2590]] is cut down [[G1581]] and [[G2532]] thrown [[G906]] into [[G1519]] [the] fire. [[G4442]]

###### 20
So then, [[G686]] by [[G575]] their [[G846]] fruit [[G2590]] you will recognize [[G1921]] them. [[G846]]

###### 21
Not [[G3756]] everyone [[G3956]] who [[G3588]] says [[G3004]] to Me, [[G1473]] ‘Lord, [[G2962]] Lord,’ [[G2962]] will enter [[G1525]] the [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] of [[G3588]] heaven, [[G3772]] but only [[G235]] he who [[G3588]] does [[G4160]] the [[G3588]] will [[G2307]] of My [[G1473]] Father [[G3962]] in [[G1722]] heaven. [[G3772]]

###### 22
Many [[G4183]] will say [[G2046]] to Me [[G1473]] on [[G1722]] that [[G1565]] day, [[G2250]] ‘Lord, [[G2962]] Lord, [[G2962]] did we not prophesy [[G4395]] in [[G3588]] Your [[G4674]] name, [[G3686]] and [[G2532]] [in] [[G3588]] Your [[G4674]] name [[G3686]] drive out [[G1544]] demons [[G1140]] and [[G2532]] perform [[G4160]] many [[G4183]] miracles? [[G1411]]

###### 23
Then [[G5119]] I will tell them plainly, [[G3670]] ‘I never knew [[G1097]] you; [[G4771]] depart [[G672]] from [[G575]] Me, [[G1473]] [you] [[G3588]] workers [[G2038]] of lawlessness!’ [[G458]]

###### 24
Therefore [[G3767]] everyone [[G3956]] who [[G3748]] hears [[G191]] these [[G3778]] words [[G3056]] of Mine [[G1473]] and [[G2532]] acts on [[G4160]] them [[G846]] is like [[G3666]] [a] wise [[G5429]] man [[G435]] who [[G3748]] built [[G3618]] his [[G846]] house [[G3614]] on [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] rock. [[G4073]]

###### 25
The [[G3588]] rain [[G1028]] fell, [[G2597]] the [[G3588]] torrents [[G4215]] raged, [[G2064]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] winds [[G417]] blew [[G4154]] and [[G2532]] beat against [[G4363]] that [[G1565]] house; [[G3614]] yet [[G2532]] it did not fall, [[G4098]] because [[G1063]] its foundation was [[G2311]] on [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] rock. [[G4073]]

###### 26
But [[G2532]] everyone [[G3956]] who [[G3588]] hears [[G191]] these [[G3778]] words [[G3056]] of Mine [[G1473]] and [[G2532]] does not act on [[G4160]] them [[G846]] is like [[G3666]] a foolish [[G3474]] man [[G435]] who [[G3748]] built [[G3618]] his [[G846]] house [[G3614]] on [[G1909]] sand. [[G285]]

###### 27
The [[G3588]] rain [[G1028]] fell, [[G2597]] the [[G3588]] torrents [[G4215]] raged, [[G2064]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] winds [[G417]] blew [[G4154]] and [[G2532]] beat against [[G4350]] that [[G1565]] house, [[G3614]] and [[G2532]] it fell— [[G4098]] and [[G2532]] great [[G3173]] was [[G1510]] its [[G846]] collapse! [[G4431]]

###### 28
When [[G3753]] Jesus [[G2424]] had finished [[G5055]] saying [[G3056]] these things, [[G3778]] the [[G3588]] crowds [[G3793]] were amazed [[G1605]] at [[G1909]] His [[G846]] teaching, [[G1322]]

###### 29
because [[G1063]] He [[G1510]] taught [[G1321]] as [one] [[G5613]] who had [[G2192]] authority, [[G1849]] and [[G2532]] not [[G3756]] as [[G5613]] their [[G846]] scribes. [[G1122]]
