###### 1
When [[G1161]] Jesus saw [[G3708]] the [[G3588]] crowds, [[G3793]] He went up [[G305]] on [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] mountain [[G3735]] and [[G2532]] sat down. [[G2523]] His [[G846]] disciples [[G3101]] came [[G4334]] to Him, [[G846]]

###### 2
and [[G2532]] He began [[G455]] to teach [[G1321]] them, [[G846]] saying: [[G3004]]

###### 3
“Blessed [are] [[G3107]] the [[G3588]] poor [[G4434]] in [[G3588]] spirit, [[G4151]] for [[G3754]] theirs [[G846]] is [[G1510]] the [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] of [[G3588]] heaven. [[G3772]]

###### 4
Blessed [are] [[G3107]] those who [[G3588]] mourn, [[G3996]] for [[G3754]] they [[G846]] will be comforted. [[G3870]]

###### 5
Blessed [are] [[G3107]] the [[G3588]] meek, [[G4239]] for [[G3754]] they [[G846]] will inherit [[G2816]] the [[G3588]] earth. [[G1093]]

###### 6
Blessed [are] [[G3107]] those [[G3588]] who hunger [[G3983]] and [[G2532]] thirst [[G1372]] for [[G3588]] righteousness, [[G1343]] for [[G3754]] they [[G846]] will be filled. [[G5526]]

###### 7
Blessed [are] [[G3107]] the [[G3588]] merciful, [[G1655]] for [[G3754]] they [[G846]] will be shown mercy. [[G1653]]

###### 8
Blessed [are] [[G3107]] the [[G3588]] pure [[G2513]] in heart, [[G2588]] for [[G3754]] they [[G846]] will see [[G3708]] God. [[G2316]]

###### 9
Blessed [are] [[G3107]] the [[G3588]] peacemakers, [[G1518]] for [[G3754]] they [[G846]] will be called [[G2564]] sons [[G5207]] of God. [[G2316]]

###### 10
Blessed [are] [[G3107]] those who [[G3588]] are persecuted [[G1377]] because of [[G1752]] righteousness, [[G1343]] for [[G3754]] theirs [[G846]] is [[G1510]] the [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] of [[G3588]] heaven. [[G3772]]

###### 11
Blessed [[G3107]] are you [[G1510]] when [[G3752]] [people] insult [[G3679]] you, [[G4771]] persecute [you], [[G1377]] and [[G2532]] falsely [[G5574]] say [[G2036]] all kinds of [[G3956]] evil [[G4190]] against [[G2596]] you [[G4771]] because of [[G1752]] Me. [[G1473]]

###### 12
Rejoice [[G5463]] and [[G2532]] celebrate, [[G21]] because [[G3754]] great [is] [[G4183]] your [[G4771]] reward [[G3408]] in [[G1722]] heaven; [[G3772]] for [[G1063]] in the same way [[G3779]] they persecuted [[G1377]] the [[G3588]] prophets [[G4396]] before [[G4253]] you. [[G4771]]

###### 13
You [[G4771]] are [[G1510]] the [[G3588]] salt [[G217]] of the [[G3588]] earth. [[G1093]] But [[G1161]] if [[G1437]] the [[G3588]] salt [[G217]] loses its savor, [[G3471]] how [[G1722]] can it be made salty again? [[G233]] It is no longer good [[G2480]] for [[G1519]] [anything], [[G3762]] except [[G1487]] to be thrown [[G906]] out [[G1854]] [and] trampled [[G2662]] by [[G5259]] men. [[G444]]

###### 14
You [[G4771]] are [[G1510]] the [[G3588]] light [[G5457]] of the [[G3588]] world. [[G2889]] A city [[G4172]] on [[G1883]] a hill [[G3735]] cannot [[G1410]] be hidden. [[G2928]]

###### 15
Neither [[G3761]] do [people] light [[G2545]] a lamp [[G3088]] and [[G2532]] put [[G5087]] it [[G846]] under [[G5259]] a basket. [[G3426]] Instead, [[G235]] [they set it] on [[G1909]] a lampstand, [[G3087]] and [[G2532]] it gives light [[G2989]] to everyone [[G3956]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] house. [[G3614]]

###### 16
In the same way, [[G3779]] {let} [[G3588]] your [[G4771]] light [[G5457]] shine [[G2989]] before [[G1715]] men, [[G444]] that [[G3704]] they may see [[G3708]] your [[G4771]] good [[G2570]] deeds [[G2041]] and [[G2532]] glorify [[G1392]] your [[G4771]] Father [[G3962]] in [[G1722]] heaven. [[G3772]]

###### 17
{Do} not [[G3361]] think [[G3543]] that [[G3754]] I have come [[G2064]] to abolish [[G2647]] the [[G3588]] Law [[G3551]] or [[G2228]] the [[G3588]] Prophets; [[G4396]] I have not come [[G2064]] to abolish [them], [[G2647]] but [[G235]] to fulfill [them]. [[G4137]]

###### 18
For [[G1063]] I tell [[G3004]] you [[G4771]] truly, [[G281]] until [[G2193]] heaven [[G3772]] and [[G2532]] earth [[G1093]] pass away, [[G3928]] not [[G3756]] a single [[G1520]] jot, [[G2503]] not [[G2228]] a [[G1520]] stroke of a pen, [[G2762]] will disappear [[G3928]] from [[G575]] the [[G3588]] Law [[G3551]] until [[G2193]] everything [[G3956]] is accomplished. [[G1096]]

###### 19
So then, [[G3767]] whoever [[G3739]] breaks [[G3089]] one [[G1520]] of the [[G3588]] least [[G1646]] of these [[G3778]] commandments [[G1785]] and [[G2532]] teaches [[G1321]] others [[G444]] to do likewise [[G3779]] will be called [[G2564]] least [[G1646]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] of [[G3588]] heaven, [[G3772]] but [[G1161]] whoever [[G3739]] practices [[G4160]] and [[G2532]] teaches [them] [[G1321]] will be called [[G2564]] great [[G3173]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] of [[G3588]] heaven. [[G3772]]

###### 20
For [[G1063]] I tell [[G3004]] you [[G4771]] that [[G3754]] unless [[G1437]] your [[G4771]] righteousness [[G1343]] exceeds [[G4052]] [that] of the [[G3588]] scribes [[G1122]] and [[G2532]] Pharisees, [[G5330]] you will never enter [[G1525]] the [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] of [[G3588]] heaven. [[G3772]]

###### 21
You have heard [[G191]] that [[G3754]] it was said [[G2046]] to the [[G3588]] ancients, [[G744]] ‘Do not murder, [[G5407]] and [[G1161]] anyone who [[G3739]] murders [[G5407]] will be [[G1510]] subject [[G1777]] to [[G3588]] judgment.’ [[G2920]]

###### 22
But [[G1161]] I [[G1473]] tell [[G3004]] you [[G4771]] that [[G3754]] anyone [[G3956]] who [[G3588]] is angry with [[G3710]] his [[G846]] brother [[G80]] will be [[G1510]] subject [[G1777]] to [[G3588]] judgment. [[G2920]] Again, [[G1161]] anyone who [[G3739]] says [[G2036]] to [[G3588]] his [[G846]] brother, [[G80]] Raca, [[G4469]] will be [[G1510]] subject [[G1777]] to the [[G3588]] Sanhedrin. [[G4892]] But [[G1161]] anyone who [[G3739]] says, [[G2036]] You fool! [[G3474]] will be [[G1510]] subject [[G1777]] to [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] fire [[G4442]] of hell. [[G1067]]

###### 23
Therefore [[G3767]] if [[G1437]] you are offering [[G4374]] your [[G4771]] gift [[G1435]] at [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] altar [[G2379]] and there [[G2546]] remember [[G3403]] that [[G3754]] your [[G4771]] brother [[G80]] has [[G2192]] something [[G5100]] against [[G2596]] you, [[G4771]]

###### 24
leave [[G863]] your [[G4771]] gift [[G1435]] there [[G1563]] before [[G1715]] the [[G3588]] altar. [[G2379]] First [[G4412]] go [and] [[G5217]] be reconciled [[G1259]] to [[G3588]] your [[G4771]] brother; [[G80]] then [[G5119]] come [and] [[G2064]] offer [[G4374]] your [[G4771]] gift. [[G1435]]

###### 25
Reconcile [[G2132]] quickly [[G5035]] with [[G3588]] your [[G4771]] adversary, [[G476]] while [[G2193]] you are still [[G1510]] on [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] way [to court]. [[G3598]] Otherwise [[G3361]] [he] [[G476]] may hand you over [[G3860]] to the [[G3588]] judge, [[G2923]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] judge [may hand you over] [[G2923]] to the [[G3588]] officer, [[G5257]] and [[G2532]] you may be thrown [[G906]] into [[G1519]] prison. [[G5438]]

###### 26
Truly [[G281]] I tell [[G3004]] you, [[G4771]] you will not get out [[G1831]] until [[G2193]] you have paid [[G591]] the [[G3588]] last [[G2078]] penny. [[G2835]]

###### 27
You have heard [[G191]] that [[G3754]] it was said, [[G2046]] ‘Do not commit adultery.’ [[G3431]]

###### 28
But [[G1161]] I [[G1473]] tell [[G3004]] you [[G4771]] that [[G3754]] anyone [[G3956]] who looks at [[G991]] a woman [[G1135]] to [[G4314]] lust after [[G1937]] her [[G846]] {has} already [[G2235]] committed adultery with [[G3431]] her [[G846]] in [[G1722]] his [[G846]] heart. [[G2588]]

###### 29
If [[G1487]] your [[G4771]] right [[G1188]] eye [[G3788]] causes you to sin, [[G4624]] gouge it out [[G1807]] and [[G2532]] throw [it] [[G906]] away. [[G575]] It is better [[G4851]] for you [[G4771]] to [[G2443]] lose [[G622]] one [[G1520]] part of your body [[G3196]] [than for] [[G2532]] your [[G4771]] whole [[G3650]] body [[G4983]] to be thrown [[G906]] into [[G1519]] hell. [[G1067]]

###### 30
And [[G2532]] if [[G1487]] your [[G4771]] right [[G1188]] hand [[G5495]] causes you to sin, [[G4624]] cut it off [[G1581]] and [[G2532]] throw [it] [[G906]] away. [[G575]] It is better [[G4851]] for you [[G4771]] to [[G2443]] lose [[G622]] one [[G1520]] part of your body [[G3196]] [than for] [[G2532]] your [[G4771]] whole [[G3650]] body [[G4983]] to depart [[G565]] into [[G1519]] hell. [[G1067]]

###### 31
It has also been said, [[G2046]] ‘Whoever [[G3739]] divorces [[G630]] his [[G846]] wife [[G1135]] must give [[G1325]] her [[G846]] a certificate of divorce.’ [[G647]]

###### 32
But [[G1161]] I [[G1473]] tell [[G3004]] you [[G4771]] that [[G3754]] anyone [[G3956]] who divorces [[G630]] his [[G846]] wife, [[G1135]] except [[G3924]] for [[G3056]] sexual immorality, [[G4202]] brings [[G4160]] adultery [[G3431]] upon her. [[G846]] And [[G2532]] whoever [[G3739]] marries [[G1060]] a divorced woman [[G630]] commits adultery. [[G3429]]

###### 33
Again, [[G3825]] you have heard [[G191]] that [[G3754]] it was said [[G2046]] to the [[G3588]] ancients, [[G744]] ‘Do not break your oath, [[G1964]] but [[G1161]] fulfill [[G591]] your [[G4771]] vows [[G3727]] to the [[G3588]] Lord.’ [[G2962]]

###### 34
But [[G1161]] I [[G1473]] tell [[G3004]] you [[G4771]] not [[G3361]] to swear [[G3660]] at all: [[G3654]] [either] [[G3383]] by [[G1722]] heaven, [[G3772]] for [[G3754]] it is [[G1510]] God’s [[G2316]] throne; [[G2362]]

###### 35
[or] [[G3383]] by [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] earth, [[G1093]] for [[G3754]] it is [[G1510]] His footstool; [[G5286]] [or] [[G3383]] by [[G1519]] Jerusalem, [[G2414]] for [[G3754]] it is [[G1510]] [the] city [[G4172]] of the [[G3588]] great [[G3173]] King. [[G935]]

###### 36
Nor [[G3383]] should you swear [[G3660]] by [[G1722]] your [[G4771]] head, [[G2776]] for [[G3754]] you cannot [[G1410]] make [[G4160]] a single [[G1520]] hair [[G2359]] white [[G3022]] or [[G2228]] black. [[G3189]]

###### 37
Simply [[G1161]] let [[G1510]] your [[G4771]] ‘Yes’ [[G3483]] [be] ‘Yes,’ [[G3483]] [and your] ‘No,’ [[G3756]] ‘No.’ [[G3756]] Anything [[G3588]] more [[G4053]] comes [[G1510]] from [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] evil [one]. [[G4190]]

###### 38
You have heard [[G191]] that [[G3754]] it was said, [[G2046]] ‘Eye [[G3788]] for [[G473]] eye [[G3788]] and [[G2532]] tooth [[G3599]] for [[G473]] tooth.’ [[G3599]]

###### 39
But [[G1161]] I [[G1473]] tell [[G3004]] you [[G4771]] not [[G3361]] to resist [[G436]] an [[G3588]] evil [person]. [[G4190]] [If] someone [[G3748]] slaps [[G4474]] you [[G4771]] on [[G1519]] your [[G4771]] right [[G1188]] cheek, [[G4600]] turn [[G4762]] to him [[G846]] the [[G3588]] other [[G243]] also; [[G2532]]

###### 40
if someone [[G3588]] wants [[G2309]] to sue [[G2919]] you [[G4771]] and [[G2532]] take [[G2983]] your [[G4771]] tunic, [[G5509]] let him have [[G863]] [your] [[G3588]] cloak [[G2440]] as well; [[G2532]]

###### 41
and [[G2532]] if someone [[G3748]] forces you to go [[G29]] one [[G1520]] mile, [[G3400]] go [[G5217]] with [[G3326]] him [[G846]] two. [[G1417]]

###### 42
Give [[G1325]] to the [one] [[G3588]] who asks [[G154]] you, [[G4771]] and [[G2532]] do not turn away from [[G654]] the [one] [[G3588]] who wants [[G2309]] to borrow [[G1155]] from [[G575]] you. [[G4771]]

###### 43
You have heard [[G191]] that [[G3754]] it was said, [[G2046]] ‘Love [[G25]] your [[G4771]] neighbor [[G4139]] and [[G2532]] hate [[G3404]] your [[G4771]] enemy.’ [[G2190]]

###### 44
But [[G1161]] I [[G1473]] tell [[G3004]] you, [[G4771]] love [[G25]] your [[G4771]] enemies [[G2190]] and [[G2532]] pray [[G4336]] for [[G5228]] those who [[G3588]] persecute [[G1377]] you, [[G4771]]

###### 45
that [[G3704]] you may be [[G1096]] sons [[G5207]] of [[G3588]] your [[G4771]] Father [[G3962]] in [[G1722]] heaven. [[G3772]] He causes [[G393]] His [[G846]] sun {to rise} [[G2246]] on [[G1909]] [the] evil [[G4190]] and [[G2532]] [the] good, [[G18]] and [[G2532]] sends rain [[G1026]] on [[G1909]] [the] righteous [[G1342]] and [[G2532]] [the] unrighteous. [[G94]]

###### 46
If [[G1437]] you love [[G25]] those [[G3588]] who love [[G25]] you, [[G4771]] what [[G5101]] reward [[G3408]] will you get? [[G2192]] Do not [[G3780]] even [[G2532]] tax collectors [[G5057]] do [[G4160]] the [[G3588]] same? [[G846]]

###### 47
And [[G2532]] if [[G1437]] you greet [[G782]] only [[G3440]] your [[G4771]] brothers, [[G80]] what [[G5101]] are you doing [[G4160]] more than others? [[G4053]] Do not [[G3780]] even [[G2532]] Gentiles [[G1482]] do [[G4160]] the [[G3588]] same? [[G846]]

###### 48
Be [[G1510]] perfect, [[G5046]] therefore, [[G3767]] as [[G5613]] your [[G4771]] Heavenly [[G3770]] Father [[G3962]] is [[G1510]] perfect. [[G5046]]
