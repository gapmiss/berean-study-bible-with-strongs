###### 1
Then [[G5119]] Jesus [[G2424]] spoke [[G2980]] to the [[G3588]] crowds [[G3793]] and [[G2532]] to [[G3588]] His [[G846]] disciples: [[G3101]]

###### 2
“The [[G3588]] scribes [[G1122]] and [[G2532]] Pharisees [[G5330]] sit [[G2523]] in [[G1909]] Moses’ [[G3475]] seat. [[G2515]]

###### 3
So [[G3767]] practice [[G4160]] and [[G2532]] observe [[G5083]] everything [[G3956]] they tell [[G2036]] you. [[G4771]] But [[G1161]] {do} not [[G3361]] do [[G4160]] what [[G2596]] they [[G846]] do, [[G2041]] for [[G1063]] they do not practice [[G4160]] what [[G2532]] they preach. [[G3004]]

###### 4
They tie up [[G1195]] heavy, [[G926]] burdensome [[G1419]] loads [[G5413]] and [[G2532]] lay [them] [[G2007]] on [[G1909]] men’s [[G444]] shoulders, [[G5606]] but [[G1161]] they themselves [[G846]] are not willing [[G2309]] to lift a finger [[G1147]] to move [[G2795]] them. [[G846]]

###### 5
All [[G3956]] their [[G846]] deeds [[G2041]] are done [[G4160]] for [[G4314]] men [[G444]] to see. [[G2300]] They broaden [[G4115]] their [[G846]] phylacteries [[G5440]] and [[G2532]] lengthen [[G3170]] their [[G3588]] tassels. [[G2899]]

###### 6
They love [[G5368]] the [[G3588]] places of honor [[G4411]] at [[G1722]] banquets, [[G1173]] the [[G3588]] chief seats [[G4410]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] synagogues, [[G4864]]

###### 7
the [[G3588]] greetings [[G783]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] marketplaces, [[G58]] and [[G2532]] the title [[G2564]] of ‘Rabbi’ [[G4461]] by [[G5259]] [which they are addressed]. [[G444]]

###### 8
But [[G1161]] you [[G4771]] are not to be called [[G2564]] ‘Rabbi,’ [[G4461]] for [[G1063]] you [[G4771]] [have] [[G1510]] one [[G1520]] Teacher, [[G1320]] and [[G1161]] you [[G4771]] are [[G1510]] all [[G3956]] brothers. [[G80]]

###### 9
And [[G2532]] do not call anyone [[G2564]] on [[G1909]] earth [[G1093]] your [[G4771]] father, [[G3962]] for [[G1063]] you [[G4771]] [have] [[G1510]] one [[G1520]] Father, [[G3962]] who [is] [[G3588]] in heaven. [[G3770]]

###### 10
Nor [[G3366]] are you to be called [[G2564]] instructors, [[G2519]] for [[G3754]] you [[G4771]] [have] [[G1510]] one [[G1520]] Instructor, [[G2519]] the [[G3588]] Christ. [[G5547]]

###### 11
The [[G3588]] greatest [[G3173]] among you [[G4771]] shall be [[G1510]] your [[G4771]] servant. [[G1249]]

###### 12
For [[G1161]] whoever [[G3748]] exalts [[G5312]] himself [[G1438]] will be humbled, [[G5013]] and [[G2532]] whoever [[G3748]] humbles [[G5013]] himself [[G1438]] will be exalted. [[G5312]]

###### 13
Woe [[G3759]] to you, [[G4771]] scribes [[G1122]] and [[G2532]] Pharisees, [[G5330]] you hypocrites! [[G5273]] You shut [[G2808]] the [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] of [[G3588]] heaven [[G3772]] in men’s faces. [[G1715]] You yourselves [[G4771]] do not enter, [[G1525]] nor [[G3761]] will you let [[G863]] in [[G1525]] those who [[G3588]] wish to enter. [[G1525]]

###### 14
Woe [[G3759]] to you, [[G4771]] scribes [[G1122]] and [[G2532]] Pharisees, [[G5330]] hypocrites! [[G5273]] For [[G3754]] you devour [[G2719]] the [[G3588]] houses [[G3614]] of widows, [[G5503]] and [[G2532]] as a pretext [[G4392]] are praying [[G4336]] at great length. [[G3117]] Because of [[G1223]] this, [[G3778]] you shall receive [[G2983]] greater [[G4053]] condemnation. [[G2917]]

###### 15
Woe [[G3759]] to you, [[G4771]] scribes [[G1122]] and [[G2532]] Pharisees, [[G5330]] you hypocrites! [[G5273]] You traverse [[G4013]] [land] [[G3584]] and [[G2532]] sea [[G2281]] to win [[G4160]] a single [[G1520]] convert, [[G4339]] and [[G2532]] when [[G3752]] he becomes [one], [[G1096]] you make [[G4160]] him [[G846]] twice as much [[G1362]] a son [[G5207]] of hell [[G1067]] as you are. [[G4771]]

###### 16
Woe [[G3759]] to you, [[G4771]] blind [[G5185]] guides! [[G3595]] [You] [[G3588]] say, [[G3004]] ‘If anyone [[G3739]] swears [[G3660]] by [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] temple, [[G3485]] it means [[G1510]] nothing; [[G3762]] but [[G1161]] if anyone [[G3739]] swears [[G3660]] by [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] gold [[G5557]] of the [[G3588]] temple, [[G3485]] he is bound by his oath. [[G3784]]

###### 17
[You] blind [[G5185]] fools! [[G3474]] Which [[G5101]] is [[G1510]] greater: [[G3173]] the [[G3588]] gold, [[G5557]] or [[G2228]] the [[G3588]] temple [[G3485]] that makes it sacred? [[G37]]

###### 18
And [you say], [[G2532]] ‘If anyone [[G3739]] swears [[G3660]] by [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] altar, [[G2379]] it means [[G1510]] nothing; [[G3762]] but [[G1161]] if anyone [[G3739]] swears [[G3660]] by [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] gift [[G1435]] on [[G1883]] it, [[G846]] he is bound by his oath.’ [[G3784]]

###### 19
You blind men! [[G5185]] Which [[G5101]] [is] greater: [[G3173]] the [[G3588]] gift, [[G1435]] or [[G2228]] the [[G3588]] altar [[G2379]] that makes it sacred? [[G37]]

###### 20
So then, [[G3767]] he who [[G3588]] swears [[G3660]] by [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] altar [[G2379]] swears [[G3660]] by [[G1722]] it [[G846]] and [[G2532]] by [[G1722]] everything [[G3956]] on [[G1883]] it. [[G846]]

###### 21
And [[G2532]] he who [[G3588]] swears [[G3660]] by [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] temple [[G3485]] swears [[G3660]] by [[G1722]] it [[G846]] and [[G2532]] by [[G1722]] the [One] [[G3588]] who dwells [[G2730]] in it. [[G846]]

###### 22
And [[G2532]] he who [[G3588]] swears [[G3660]] by [[G1722]] heaven [[G3772]] swears [[G3660]] by [[G1722]] God’s [[G2316]] throne [[G2362]] and [[G2532]] by [[G1722]] the [One] [[G3588]] who sits [[G2521]] on [[G1883]] it. [[G846]]

###### 23
Woe [[G3759]] to you, [[G4771]] scribes [[G1122]] and [[G2532]] Pharisees, [[G5330]] you hypocrites! [[G5273]] You pay tithes of [[G586]] mint, [[G2238]] dill, [[G432]] and [[G2532]] cumin, [[G2951]] but [[G2532]] you have disregarded [[G863]] the [[G3588]] weightier [matters] [[G926]] of the [[G3588]] Law: [[G3551]] justice, [[G2920]] mercy, [[G1656]] and [[G2532]] faithfulness. [[G4102]] You should have [[G1163]] practiced [[G4160]] the latter, [[G3778]] without [[G1161]] neglecting [[G863]] the former. [[G2548]]

###### 24
You blind [[G5185]] guides! [[G3595]] You strain out [[G1368]] a gnat [[G2971]] but [[G1161]] swallow [[G2666]] a camel. [[G2574]]

###### 25
Woe [[G3759]] to you, [[G4771]] scribes [[G1122]] and [[G2532]] Pharisees, [[G5330]] you hypocrites! [[G5273]] You clean [[G2511]] the [[G3588]] outside [[G1855]] of the [[G3588]] cup [[G4221]] and [[G2532]] dish, [[G3953]] but [[G1161]] inside [[G2081]] they are full [[G1073]] of [[G1537]] greed [[G724]] and [[G2532]] self-indulgence. [[G192]]

###### 26
Blind [[G5185]] Pharisee! [[G5330]] First [[G4412]] clean [[G2511]] the [[G3588]] inside [[G1787]] of the [[G3588]] cup [[G4221]] and [[G2532]] dish, [[G3953]] so that [[G2443]] the [[G3588]] outside [[G1622]] may become [[G1096]] clean [[G2513]] as well. [[G2532]]

###### 27
Woe [[G3759]] to you, [[G4771]] scribes [[G1122]] and [[G2532]] Pharisees, [[G5330]] you hypocrites! [[G5273]] You are like [[G3945]] whitewashed [[G2867]] tombs, [[G5028]] which [[G3748]] look [[G5316]] beautiful [[G5611]] on the outside, [[G1855]] but [[G1161]] on the inside [[G2081]] are full [[G1073]] of dead [men’s] [[G3498]] bones [[G3747]] and [[G2532]] every [[G3956]] impurity. [[G167]]

###### 28
In the same way, [[G3779]] you [[G4771]] appear [[G5316]] to be righteous [[G1342]] on the outside, [[G1855]] but [[G1161]] on the inside [[G2081]] you are [[G1510]] full [[G3324]] of hypocrisy [[G5272]] and [[G2532]] wickedness. [[G458]]

###### 29
Woe [[G3759]] to you, [[G4771]] scribes [[G1122]] and [[G2532]] Pharisees, [[G5330]] you hypocrites! [[G5273]] You build [[G3618]] tombs [[G5028]] for the [[G3588]] prophets [[G4396]] and [[G2532]] decorate [[G2885]] the [[G3588]] monuments [[G3419]] of the [[G3588]] righteous. [[G1342]]

###### 30
And [[G2532]] you say, [[G3004]] ‘If [[G1487]] we had lived [[G1510]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] days [[G2250]] of our [[G1473]] fathers, [[G3962]] we would not have been [[G1510]] partners [[G2844]] with them [[G846]] in [shedding] [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] blood [[G129]] of the [[G3588]] prophets.’ [[G4396]]

###### 31
So [[G5620]] you testify [[G3140]] against yourselves [[G1438]] that [[G3754]] you are [[G1510]] [the] sons [[G5207]] of those [[G3588]] who murdered [[G5407]] the [[G3588]] prophets. [[G4396]]

###### 32
Fill up, [[G4137]] then, [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] measure [[G3358]] of [[G3588]] your [[G4771]] fathers’ [sins]. [[G3962]]

###### 33
You snakes! [[G3789]] You brood [[G1081]] of vipers! [[G2191]] How [[G4459]] will you escape [[G5343]] the [[G3588]] sentence [[G2920]] of hell? [[G1067]]

###### 34
Because of [[G1223]] this, [[G3778]] I [[G1473]] am sending [[G649]] you [[G4771]] prophets [[G4396]] and [[G2532]] wise [men] [[G4680]] and [[G2532]] teachers. [[G1122]] Some of [[G1537]] them [[G846]] you will kill [[G615]] and [[G2532]] crucify, [[G4717]] and [[G2532]] [others] [[G846]] you will flog [[G3146]] in [[G1722]] your [[G4771]] synagogues [[G4864]] and [[G2532]] persecute [[G1377]] in [[G575]] town [[G4172]] after [[G1519]] town. [[G4172]]

###### 35
And so [[G3704]] upon [[G1909]] you [[G4771]] will come [[G2064]] all [[G3956]] [the] righteous [[G1342]] blood [[G129]] shed [[G1632]] on [[G1909]] earth, [[G1093]] from [[G575]] the [[G3588]] blood [[G129]] of [[G3588]] righteous [[G1342]] Abel [[G6]] to [[G2193]] the [[G3588]] blood [[G129]] of Zechariah [[G2197]] son [[G5207]] of Berekiah, [[G914]] whom [[G3739]] you murdered [[G5407]] between [[G3342]] the [[G3588]] temple [[G3485]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] altar. [[G2379]]

###### 36
Truly [[G281]] I tell [[G3004]] you, [[G4771]] all [[G3956]] these things [[G3778]] will come [[G2240]] upon [[G1909]] this [[G3778]] generation. [[G1074]]

###### 37
O Jerusalem, [[G2419]] Jerusalem, [[G2419]] who [[G3588]] kills [[G615]] the [[G3588]] prophets [[G4396]] and [[G2532]] stones [[G3036]] those [[G3588]] sent [[G649]] to [[G4314]] her, [[G846]] how often [[G4212]] I have longed [[G2309]] to gather [[G1996]] your [[G4771]] children {together}, [[G5043]] as [[G5158]] a hen [[G3733]] gathers [[G1996]] her [[G846]] chicks [[G3556]] under [[G5259]] [her] [[G3588]] wings, [[G4420]] but [[G2532]] you were unwilling! [[G2309]]

###### 38
Look, [[G2400]] your [[G4771]] house [[G3624]] is left [[G863]] to you [[G4771]] desolate. [[G2048]]

###### 39
For [[G1063]] I tell [[G3004]] you [that] [[G4771]] you will not see [[G3708]] Me [[G1473]] again [[G575]] until [[G2193]] you say, [[G2036]] ‘Blessed [is] [[G2127]] He who [[G3588]] comes [[G2064]] in [[G1722]] [the] name [[G3686]] of [the] Lord.’” [[G2962]]
