###### 1
At [[G1722]] that [[G1565]] time [[G5610]] the [[G3588]] disciples [[G3101]] came [[G4334]] to Jesus [[G2424]] [and] asked, [[G3004]] “Who [[G5101]] then [[G686]] is [[G1510]] [the] greatest [[G3173]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] of [[G3588]] heaven?” [[G3772]]

###### 2
[Jesus] called [[G4341]] a little child [[G3813]] to stand [[G2476]] among them. [[G3319]]

###### 3
“Truly [[G281]] I tell [[G3004]] you,” [[G4771]] He said, [[G2036]] “unless [[G1437]] you change [[G4762]] and [[G2532]] become [[G1096]] like [[G5613]] little children, [[G3813]] you will never enter [[G1525]] the [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] of [[G3588]] heaven. [[G3772]]

###### 4
Therefore, [[G3767]] whoever [[G3748]] humbles [[G5013]] himself [[G1438]] like [[G5613]] this [[G3778]] little child [[G3813]] is [[G1510]] the [[G3588]] greatest [[G3173]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] of [[G3588]] heaven. [[G3772]]

###### 5
And [[G2532]] whoever [[G3739]] welcomes [[G1209]] a [[G1520]] little child [[G3813]] like this [[G5108]] in [[G1909]] My [[G1473]] name [[G3686]] welcomes [[G1209]] Me. [[G1473]]

###### 6
But [[G1161]] if [[G302]] anyone [[G3739]] causes [[G4624]] one [[G1520]] of these [[G3778]] little ones [[G3398]] who [[G3588]] believe [[G4100]] in [[G1519]] Me {to stumble}, [[G1473]] it would be better [[G4851]] for him [[G846]] to have [[G2443]] a large [[G3684]] millstone [[G3458]] hung [[G2910]] around [[G4012]] his [[G846]] neck [[G5137]] and [[G2532]] to be drowned [[G2670]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] depths [[G3989]] of the [[G3588]] sea. [[G2281]]

###### 7
Woe [[G3759]] to the [[G3588]] world [[G2889]] for [[G575]] the [[G3588]] causes of sin. [[G4625]] [These] [[G3588]] stumbling blocks [[G4625]] must [[G318]] come, [[G2064]] but [[G4133]] woe [[G3759]] to the [[G3588]] man [[G444]] through [[G1223]] whom [[G3739]] [they] [[G4625]] come! [[G2064]]

###### 8
If [[G1487]] your [[G4771]] hand [[G5495]] or [[G2228]] your [[G4771]] foot [[G4228]] causes you to fall into sin, [[G4624]] cut it off [[G1581]] and [[G2532]] throw it away. [[G906]] It is [[G1510]] better [[G2570]] for you [[G4771]] to enter [[G1525]] life [[G2222]] crippled [[G2948]] or [[G2228]] lame [[G5560]] than [[G2228]] to have [[G2192]] two [[G1417]] hands [[G5495]] [and] [[G2228]] two [[G1417]] feet [[G4228]] [and] be thrown [[G906]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] eternal [[G166]] fire. [[G4442]]

###### 9
And [[G2532]] if [[G1487]] your [[G4771]] eye [[G3788]] causes you to fall into sin, [[G4624]] gouge it out [[G1807]] and [[G2532]] throw it away. [[G906]] It is [[G1510]] better [[G2570]] for you [[G4771]] to enter [[G1525]] life [[G2222]] with one eye [[G3442]] than [[G2228]] to have [[G2192]] two [[G1417]] eyes [[G3788]] [and] be thrown [[G906]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] fire [[G4442]] of [[G3588]] hell. [[G1067]]

###### 10
See [that] [[G3708]] you do not look down on [[G2706]] any [[G1520]] of these [[G3778]] little ones. [[G3398]] For [[G1063]] I tell [[G3004]] you [[G4771]] that [[G3754]] their [[G846]] angels [[G32]] in [[G1722]] heaven [[G3772]] always [[G1223]] see [[G991]] the [[G3588]] face [[G4383]] of [[G3588]] my [[G1473]] Father [[G3962]] in [[G1722]] heaven. [[G3772]]

###### 11
For [[G1063]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of Man [[G444]] has come [[G2064]] to save [[G4982]] that which [[G3588]] has been lost. [[G622]]

###### 12
What [[G5101]] {do} you [[G4771]] think? [[G1380]] If [[G1437]] a [[G5100]] man [[G444]] has [[G1096]] a hundred [[G1540]] sheep [[G4263]] and [[G2532]] one [[G1520]] of [[G1537]] them [[G846]] goes astray, [[G4105]] will he not leave [[G863]] the [[G3588]] ninety-nine [[G1768]] on [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] hills [[G3735]] and [[G2532]] go out [[G4198]] to search for [[G2212]] the [one] [[G3588]] that is lost? [[G4105]]

###### 13
And [[G2532]] if [[G1437]] he [[G1096]] finds [[G2147]] it, [[G846]] truly [[G281]] I tell [[G3004]] you, [[G4771]] he rejoices [[G5463]] more [[G3123]] over [[G1909]] [that one sheep] [[G846]] than [[G2228]] over [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] ninety-nine [[G1768]] that did not go astray. [[G4105]]

###### 14
In the same way, [[G3779]] your [[G4771]] Father [[G3962]] in [[G1722]] heaven [[G3772]] is [[G1510]] not [[G3756]] willing [[G2307]] that [[G2443]] any [[G1520]] of these [[G3778]] little ones [[G3398]] should perish. [[G622]]

###### 15
If [[G1437]] your [[G4771]] brother [[G80]] sins [[G264]] against [[G1519]] you, [[G4771]] go [[G5217]] [and] confront [[G1651]] him [[G846]] privately. [[G3441]] If [[G1437]] he listens to [[G191]] you, [[G4771]] you have won [[G2770]] your [[G4771]] brother {over}. [[G80]]

###### 16
But [[G1161]] if [[G1437]] he will not listen, [[G191]] take [[G3880]] one [[G1520]] or [[G2228]] two [[G1417]] others [[G2089]] along, [[G3326]] so that [[G2443]] ‘every [[G3956]] matter [[G4487]] may be established [[G2476]] by [[G1909]] [the] testimony [[G4750]] of two [[G1417]] or [[G2228]] three [[G5140]] witnesses.’ [[G3144]]

###### 17
If [[G1437]] he refuses to listen [[G3878]] to them, [[G846]] tell [it] [[G2036]] to the [[G3588]] church. [[G1577]] And [[G1161]] if [[G1437]] he refuses to listen [[G3878]] even [[G2532]] to the [[G3588]] church, [[G1577]] regard [him] [[G1510]] as [[G5618]] you [would] [[G4771]] a [[G3588]] pagan [[G1482]] [or] [[G2532]] a tax collector. [[G5057]]

###### 18
Truly [[G281]] I tell [[G3004]] you, [[G4771]] whatever [[G3745]] you bind [[G1210]] on [[G1909]] earth [[G1093]] will be [[G1510]] bound [[G1210]] in [[G1722]] heaven, [[G3772]] and [[G2532]] whatever [[G3745]] you loose [[G3089]] on [[G1909]] earth [[G1093]] will be [[G1510]] loosed [[G3089]] in [[G1722]] heaven. [[G3772]]

###### 19
Again, [[G3825]] I tell [[G3004]] you [[G4771]] truly [[G281]] that [[G3754]] if [[G1437]] two [[G1417]] of [[G1537]] you [[G4771]] on [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] earth [[G1093]] agree [[G4856]] about [[G4012]] anything [[G3956]] [you] ask for, [[G154]] it will be done [[G1096]] for [you] [[G846]] by [[G3844]] My [[G1473]] Father [[G3962]] in [[G1722]] heaven. [[G3772]]

###### 20
For [[G1063]] where [[G3757]] two [[G1417]] or [[G2228]] three [[G5140]] gather together [[G4863]] in [[G1519]] My [[G1699]] name, [[G3686]] there [[G1563]] am I [[G1510]] with them.” [[G1722]]

###### 21
Then [[G5119]] Peter [[G4074]] came [[G4334]] to [Jesus] [[G846]] [and] asked, [[G2036]] “Lord, [[G2962]] how many times [[G4212]] shall I forgive [[G863]] my [[G1473]] brother [[G80]] who sins [[G264]] against [[G1519]] me? [[G1473]] Up to [[G2193]] seven times?” [[G2034]]

###### 22
Jesus [[G2424]] answered, [[G3004]] “I tell [[G3004]] you, [[G4771]] not [[G3756]] just [[G2193]] seven times, [[G2034]] but [[G235]] seventy-seven times [[G1441]] ! [[G2033]]

###### 23
Because of [[G1223]] this, [[G3778]] the [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] of [[G3588]] heaven [[G3772]] is like [[G3666]] a king [[G935]] who [[G3739]] wanted [[G2309]] to settle [[G4868]] accounts [[G3056]] with [[G3326]] his [[G846]] servants. [[G1401]]

###### 24
As [[G1161]] he [[G846]] began [[G756]] the settlements, [[G4868]] a [[G1520]] debtor [[G3781]] was brought [[G4374]] to him [[G846]] owing ten thousand [[G3463]] talents. [[G5007]]

###### 25
Since [[G1161]] [the man] [[G846]] was unable [[G2192]] to pay, [[G591]] the [[G3588]] master [[G2962]] ordered that [[G2753]] he [[G846]] be sold [[G4097]] to pay [his] debt, [[G591]] along with [[G2532]] [his] [[G3588]] wife [[G1135]] and [[G2532]] children [[G5043]] and [[G2532]] everything [[G3956]] he owned. [[G2192]]

###### 26
Then [[G3767]] the [[G3588]] servant [[G1401]] fell [[G4098]] on his knees [[G4352]] before him. [[G846]] ‘Have patience [[G3114]] with [[G1909]] me,’ [[G1473]] he begged, [[G3004]] ‘and [[G2532]] I will pay [[G591]] back [[G4771]] everything.’ [[G3956]]

###### 27
[His] [[G3588]] master [[G2962]] had compassion [on him], [[G4697]] forgave [[G863]] his [[G846]] debt, [[G1156]] [and] released [[G630]] him. [[G846]]

###### 28
But when [[G1161]] that [[G1565]] servant [[G1401]] went out, [[G1831]] he found [[G2147]] one [[G1520]] of his [[G846]] fellow servants [[G4889]] who [[G3739]] owed [[G3784]] him [[G846]] a hundred [[G1540]] denarii. [[G1220]] He grabbed [[G2902]] him [[G846]] and began to choke [him], [[G4155]] saying, [[G3004]] ‘Pay [[G591]] back [[G1487]] what [[G5100]] you owe [me]. [[G3784]]

###### 29
So [[G3767]] his [[G846]] fellow servant [[G4889]] fell down [[G4098]] [and] begged [[G3870]] him, [[G846]] ‘Have patience [[G3114]] with [[G1909]] me, [[G1473]] and [[G2532]] I will pay [[G591]] you {back}.’ [[G4771]]

###### 30
But [[G1161]] he refused. [[G2309]] Instead, [[G235]] he went [[G565]] [and] had him thrown [[G906]] into [[G1519]] prison [[G5438]] until [[G2193]] he could pay [[G591]] [his] [[G3588]] debt. [[G3784]]

###### 31
[When] [[G3767]] his [[G846]] fellow servants [[G4889]] saw [[G3708]] what [[G3588]] had happened, [[G1096]] they were greatly distressed, [[G3076]] and [[G2532]] they went [[G2064]] [and] recounted [[G1285]] all [[G3956]] [of this] [[G1096]] to [[G3588]] their [[G1438]] master. [[G2962]]

###### 32
Then [[G5119]] the [[G3588]] master [[G2962]] summoned [[G4341]] him [[G846]] [and] declared, [[G3004]] ‘[You] wicked [[G4190]] servant! [[G1401]] I forgave [[G863]] all [[G3956]] [your] [[G1565]] debt [[G3782]] because [[G1893]] you begged [[G3870]] me. [[G1473]]

###### 33
Should [[G1163]] you [[G4771]] not [[G3756]] have had mercy [[G1653]] on your [[G4771]] fellow servant, [[G4889]] just as [[G5613]] I [[G2504]] [had] [[G1653]] on you?’ [[G4771]]

###### 34
In his anger, [[G3710]] his [[G846]] master [[G2962]] turned him over [[G3860]] to the [[G3588]] jailers to be tortured, [[G930]] until [[G2193]] he should repay [[G591]] all [[G3956]] that [[G3588]] he owed. [[G3784]]

###### 35
That is how [[G3779]] My [[G1473]] Heavenly [[G3770]] Father [[G3962]] will treat [[G4160]] each of [[G1538]] you, [[G4771]] unless [[G1437]] you forgive [[G863]] [your] [[G846]] brother [[G80]] from [[G575]] your [[G4771]] heart.” [[G2588]]
