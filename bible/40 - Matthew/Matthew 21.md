### 1
As [[G3753]] they drew near [[G1448]] to [[G1519]] Jerusalem [[G2414]] and [[G2532]] came [[G2064]] to [[G1519]] Bethphage [[G967]] on [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] Mount [[G3735]] of Olives, [[G1636]] Jesus [[G2424]] sent out [[G649]] two [[G1417]] disciples. [[G3101]]

### 2
“Go [[G4198]] to [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] village [[G2968]] ahead [[G2713]] of you,” [[G4771]] He told [[G3004]] them, [[G846]] “and [[G2532]] at once [[G2112]] you will find [[G2147]] a donkey [[G3688]] tied [there], [[G1210]] with [[G2532]] [her] colt [[G4454]] beside [[G3326]] her. [[G846]] Untie [them] [[G3089]] [and] bring [them] [[G71]] to Me. [[G1473]]

### 3
If [[G1437]] anyone [[G5100]] questions [[G2036]] you, [[G4771]] tell [him] [[G2046]] that [[G3754]] the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] needs [[G5532]] them, [[G846]] and [[G1161]] he will send [[G649]] them [[G846]] right away.” [[G2112]]

### 4
This [[G3778]] took place [[G1096]] to [[G2443]] fulfill [[G4137]] what [[G3588]] was spoken [[G2046]] through [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] prophet: [[G4396]]

### 5
“Say [[G2036]] to the [[G3588]] daughter [[G2364]] of Zion, [[G4622]] ‘See, [[G2400]] your [[G4771]] King [[G935]] comes [[G2064]] to you, [[G4771]] gentle [[G4239]] and [[G2532]] riding [[G1910]] on [[G1909]] a donkey, [[G3688]] on [[G1909]] a colt, [[G4454]] [the] foal [[G5207]] of a beast of burden.’” [[G5268]]

### 6
So [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] disciples [[G3101]] went [[G4198]] and [[G2532]] did [[G4160]] as [[G2531]] Jesus [[G2424]] had directed [[G4929]] them. [[G846]]

### 7
They brought [[G71]] the [[G3588]] donkey [[G3688]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] colt [[G4454]] and [[G2532]] laid [[G2007]] their [[G3588]] cloaks [[G2440]] on [[G1909]] them, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] [Jesus] sat [[G1940]] on [[G1883]] them. [[G846]]

### 8
A massive [[G4118]] crowd [[G3793]] spread [[G4766]] their [[G1438]] cloaks [[G2440]] on [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] road, [[G3598]] while [[G1161]] others [[G243]] cut [[G2875]] branches [[G2798]] from [[G575]] the [[G3588]] trees [[G1186]] and [[G2532]] spread [them] [[G4766]] on [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] road. [[G3598]]

### 9
The [[G3588]] crowds [[G3793]] that [[G3588]] went ahead [[G4254]] of Him [[G846]] and [[G2532]] those that [[G3588]] followed [[G190]] were shouting: [[G2896]] “Hosanna [[G5614]] to the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of David!” [[G1138]] “Blessed is [[G2127]] He [[G3588]] who comes [[G2064]] in [[G1722]] [the] name [[G3686]] of [the] Lord!” [[G2962]] “Hosanna [[G5614]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] highest!” [[G5310]]

### 10
When [Jesus] [[G846]] had entered [[G1525]] Jerusalem, [[G2414]] the [[G3588]] whole [[G3956]] city [[G4172]] was stirred [[G4579]] [and] asked, [[G3004]] “Who [[G5101]] is [[G1510]] this?” [[G3778]]

### 11
The [[G3588]] crowds [[G3793]] replied, [[G2036]] “This [[G3778]] is [[G1510]] Jesus, [[G2424]] the [[G3588]] prophet [[G4396]] from [[G575]] Nazareth [[G3478]] in Galilee.” [[G1056]]

### 12
Then [[G2532]] Jesus [[G2424]] went [[G1525]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] temple courts [[G2411]] and [[G2532]] drove out [[G1544]] all [[G3956]] who were [[G3588]] buying [[G59]] and [[G2532]] selling [[G4453]] [there]. [[G1722]] He overturned [[G2690]] the [[G3588]] tables [[G5132]] of the [[G3588]] money changers [[G2855]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] seats [[G2515]] of those [[G3588]] selling [[G4453]] doves. [[G4058]]

### 13
And [[G2532]] He declared [[G3004]] to them, [[G846]] “It is written: [[G1125]] ‘My [[G1473]] house [[G3624]] will be called [[G2564]] a house [[G3624]] of prayer.’ [[G4335]] But [[G1161]] you [[G4771]] are making [[G4160]] it [[G846]] ‘a den [[G4693]] of robbers.’” [[G3027]]

### 14
[The] blind [[G5185]] and [[G2532]] [the] lame [[G5560]] came [[G4334]] to Him [[G846]] at [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] temple, [[G2411]] and [[G2532]] He healed [[G2323]] them. [[G846]]

### 15
But [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] chief priests [[G749]] and [[G2532]] scribes [[G1122]] were indignant [[G23]] when they saw [[G3708]] the [[G3588]] wonders [[G2297]] He did [[G4160]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] children [[G3816]] shouting [[G2896]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] temple courts, [[G2411]] “Hosanna [[G5614]] to the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of David! [[G1138]]

### 16
“Do you hear [[G191]] what [[G5101]] these [children] [[G3778]] are saying?” [[G3004]] they asked. [[G2036]] “Yes,” [[G3483]] Jesus [[G2424]] answered, [[G3004]] “have you never read: [[G314]] ‘From [[G1537]] [the] mouths [[G4750]] of children [[G3516]] and [[G2532]] infants [[G2337]] You have ordained [[G2675]] praise’?” [[G136]]

### 17
Then [[G2532]] He left [[G2641]] them [[G846]] [and] went [[G1831]] out of [[G1854]] the [[G3588]] city [[G4172]] to [[G1519]] Bethany, [[G963]] where He spent the night. [[G835]]

### 18
In the morning, [[G4404]] as [Jesus] was returning [[G1877]] to [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] city, [[G4172]] He was hungry. [[G3983]]

### 19
Seeing [[G3708]] a [[G1520]] fig tree [[G4808]] along [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] road, [[G3598]] He went up [[G2064]] to [[G1909]] it [[G846]] but [[G2532]] found [[G2147]] nothing [[G3762]] on [[G1722]] it [[G846]] except [[G1487]] leaves. [[G5444]] “May you never bear [[G1096]] fruit [[G2590]] again!” [[G3371]] He said. [[G3004]] And [[G2532]] immediately [[G3916]] the [[G3588]] tree [[G4808]] withered. [[G3583]]

### 20
When [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] disciples [[G3101]] saw [this], [[G3708]] they marveled [[G2296]] [and] asked, [[G3004]] “How {did} [[G4459]] the [[G3588]] fig tree [[G4808]] wither [[G3583]] so quickly?” [[G3916]]

### 21
“Truly [[G281]] I tell [[G3004]] you,” [[G4771]] Jesus [[G2424]] replied, [[G611]] “if [[G1437]] you have [[G2192]] faith [[G4102]] and [[G2532]] {do} not [[G3361]] doubt, [[G1252]] not [[G3756]] only [[G3440]] will you do [[G4160]] what was done [[G3588]] to the [[G3588]] fig tree, [[G4808]] but [[G235]] even if [[G2579]] you say [[G2036]] to this [[G3778]] mountain, [[G3735]] Be lifted up [[G142]] and [[G2532]] thrown [[G906]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] sea, [[G2281]] it will happen. [[G1096]]

### 22
If you believe, [[G4100]] you will receive [[G2983]] whatever [[G3956]] you ask [[G154]] in [[G1722]] prayer.” [[G4335]]

### 23
When [[G2532]] [Jesus] [[G846]] returned [[G2064]] to [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] temple courts [[G2411]] [and] began to teach, [[G1321]] the [[G3588]] chief priests [[G749]] and [[G2532]] elders [[G4245]] of the [[G3588]] people [[G2992]] came [[G4334]] to Him. [[G846]] “By [[G1722]] what [[G4169]] authority [[G1849]] are You doing [[G4160]] these things?” [[G3778]] they asked. [[G3004]] “And [[G2532]] who [[G5101]] gave [[G1325]] You [[G4771]] this [[G3778]] authority?” [[G1849]]

### 24
“I will also ask [[G2065]] you [[G4771]] one [[G1520]] question,” [[G3056]] Jesus [[G2424]] replied, [[G611]] “{and} if [[G1437]] you answer [[G2036]] Me, [[G1473]] I [[G2504]] will tell [[G2046]] you [[G4771]] by [[G1722]] what [[G4169]] authority [[G1849]] I am doing [[G4160]] these things. [[G3778]]

### 25
What was the source [[G4159]] of [[G3588]] John’s [[G2491]] baptism? [[G908]] [Was it] from [[G1537]] heaven [[G3772]] or [[G2228]] from [[G1537]] men?” [[G444]] They deliberated [[G1260]] among [[G1722]] themselves [[G1438]] [and] said, [[G3004]] “If [[G1437]] we say, [[G2036]] ‘From [[G1537]] heaven,’ [[G3772]] He will ask, [[G2046]] ‘Why [[G1223]] then [[G3767]] did you not believe [[G4100]] him?’ [[G846]]

### 26
But [[G1161]] if [[G1437]] we say, [[G2036]] ‘From [[G1537]] men,’ [[G444]] we are afraid [[G5399]] of the [[G3588]] crowd, [[G3793]] for [[G1063]] they all [[G3956]] regard [[G2192]] John [[G2491]] as [[G5613]] a prophet.” [[G4396]]

### 27
So [[G2532]] they said [[G611]] to Jesus, [[G2424]] “We do not know.” [[G1492]] “Neither [[G3761]] {will} I [[G1473]] tell [[G3004]] you [[G4771]] by [[G1722]] what [[G4169]] authority [[G1849]] I am doing [[G4160]] these things,” [[G3778]] He [[G846]] replied. [[G5346]]

### 28
“But [[G1161]] what [[G5101]] [do] you [[G4771]] think? [[G1380]] [There was] a man [[G444]] who had [[G2192]] two [[G1417]] sons. [[G5043]] He went [[G4334]] to the [[G3588]] first [[G4413]] [and] said, [[G2036]] ‘Son, [[G5043]] go [[G5217]] [and] work [[G2038]] today [[G4594]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] vineyard.’ [[G290]]

### 29
‘I will not,’ [[G2309]] he replied. [[G611]] But [[G1161]] later [[G5305]] he changed his mind [[G3338]] [and] went. [[G565]]

### 30
Then [[G1161]] [the man] went [[G4334]] to the [[G3588]] second [son] [[G1208]] [and] told [him] [[G2036]] the same thing. [[G5615]] ‘I [will], [[G1473]] sir,’ [[G2962]] he said. [[G611]] But [[G2532]] he did not go. [[G565]]

### 31
Which [[G5101]] of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] two [[G1417]] did [[G4160]] the [[G3588]] will [[G2307]] of [his] [[G3588]] father?” [[G3962]] “The [[G3588]] first,” [[G4413]] they answered. [[G3004]] Jesus [[G2424]] said [[G3004]] to them, [[G846]] “Truly [[G281]] I tell [[G3004]] you, [[G4771]] the [[G3588]] tax collectors [[G5057]] and [[G2532]] prostitutes [[G4204]] are entering [[G4254]] the [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] of God [[G2316]] before you. [[G4771]]

### 32
For [[G1063]] John [[G2491]] came [[G2064]] to [[G4314]] you [[G4771]] in [[G1722]] a righteous [[G1343]] way [[G3598]] and [[G2532]] you did not believe [[G4100]] him, [[G846]] but [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] tax collectors [[G5057]] and [[G2532]] prostitutes [[G4204]] [did]. [[G4100]] And [[G1161]] [even] [[G3761]] after [[G5305]] you saw this, [[G3708]] you [[G4771]] did not repent [[G3338]] [and] believe [[G4100]] him. [[G846]]

### 33
Listen to [[G191]] another [[G243]] parable: [[G3850]] There was [[G1510]] a landowner [[G444]] who [[G3748]] planted [[G5452]] a vineyard. [[G290]] He put [[G4060]] a wall [[G5418]] around it, [[G846]] dug [[G3736]] a winepress [[G3025]] in [[G1722]] it, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] built [[G3618]] a tower. [[G4444]] Then [[G2532]] he rented it out [[G1554]] to [some] tenants [[G1092]] and [[G2532]] went away on a journey. [[G589]]

### 34
When [[G3753]] the [[G3588]] harvest time [[G2540]] drew near, [[G1448]] he sent [[G649]] his [[G846]] servants [[G1401]] to [[G4314]] the [[G3588]] tenants [[G1092]] to collect [[G2983]] his [[G846]] share of the crop. [[G2590]]

### 35
But [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] tenants [[G1092]] seized [[G2983]] his [[G846]] servants. [[G1401]] They beat [[G1194]] one, [[G3739]] killed [[G615]] [another], [[G3739]] and [[G1161]] stoned [[G3036]] a third. [[G3739]]

### 36
Again, [[G3825]] he sent [[G649]] other [[G243]] servants, [[G1401]] more [[G4119]] than the [[G3588]] first [group]. [[G4413]] But [[G2532]] [the tenants] did [[G4160]] the same [[G5615]] to them. [[G846]]

### 37
Finally, [[G5305]] he sent [[G649]] his [[G846]] son [[G5207]] to [[G4314]] them. [[G846]] ‘They will respect [[G1788]] my [[G1473]] son,’ [[G5207]] he said. [[G3004]]

### 38
But when [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] tenants [[G1092]] saw [[G3708]] the [[G3588]] son, [[G5207]] they said [[G2036]] to [[G1722]] themselves, [[G1438]] ‘This [[G3778]] is [[G1510]] the [[G3588]] heir; [[G2818]] come, [[G1205]] let us kill [[G615]] him, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] take [[G2192]] his [[G846]] inheritance! [[G2817]]

### 39
And [[G2532]] they took [[G2983]] him [[G846]] [and] threw [him] [[G1544]] out of [[G1854]] the [[G3588]] vineyard [[G290]] and [[G2532]] killed [him]. [[G615]]

### 40
Therefore, [[G3767]] when [[G3752]] the [[G3588]] owner [[G2962]] of the [[G3588]] vineyard [[G290]] returns, [[G2064]] what [[G5101]] will he do [[G4160]] to those [[G1565]] tenants?” [[G1092]]

### 41
“He will bring [[G622]] those [[G846]] wretches [[G2556]] {to a} wretched {end},” [[G2560]] they declared, [[G3004]] “and [[G2532]] will rent out [[G1554]] the [[G3588]] vineyard [[G290]] to other [[G243]] tenants [[G1092]] who [[G3748]] will give [[G591]] him [[G846]] [his] [[G3588]] share of the crop [[G2590]] at [[G1722]] harvest time”. [[G2540]]

### 42
Jesus [[G2424]] said [[G3004]] to them, [[G846]] “Have you never read [[G314]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] Scriptures: [[G1124]] ‘[The] stone [[G3037]] the [[G3588]] builders [[G3618]] rejected [[G593]] has become [[G1096]] the [[G1519]] cornerstone. [[G1137]] This [[G3778]] is [[G1096]] from [[G3844]] [the] Lord, [[G2962]] and [[G2532]] it is [[G1510]] marvelous [[G2298]] in [[G1722]] our [[G1473]] eyes? [[G3788]]

### 43
Therefore [[G1223]] I tell [[G3004]] you [[G4771]] that [[G3754]] the [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] of God [[G2316]] will be taken away [[G142]] from [[G575]] you [[G4771]] and [[G2532]] given [[G1325]] to a people [[G1484]] who will produce [[G4160]] its [[G846]] fruit. [[G2590]]

### 44
He who [[G3588]] falls [[G4098]] on [[G1909]] this [[G3778]] stone [[G3037]] will be broken to pieces, [[G4917]] but [[G1161]] he [[G3739]] on whom [[G1909]] it falls [[G4098]] will be crushed.” [[G3039]]

### 45
When [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] chief priests [[G749]] and [[G2532]] Pharisees [[G5330]] heard [[G191]] [Jesus’] [[G846]] parables, [[G3850]] they knew [[G1097]] He was speaking [[G3004]] about [[G4012]] them. [[G846]]

### 46
Although [[G2532]] they wanted [[G2212]] to arrest [[G2902]] Him, [[G846]] they feared [[G5399]] the [[G3588]] crowds, [[G3793]] because [[G1893]] they considered [[G2192]] [Jesus] [[G846]] a prophet. [[G4396]]
