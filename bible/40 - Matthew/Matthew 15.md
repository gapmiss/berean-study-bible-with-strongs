### 1
Then [[G5119]] [some] Pharisees [[G5330]] and [[G2532]] scribes [[G1122]] came [[G4334]] to Jesus [[G2424]] from [[G575]] Jerusalem [[G2414]] [and] asked, [[G3004]]

### 2
“Why {do} [[G1223]] Your [[G4771]] disciples [[G3101]] break [[G3845]] the [[G3588]] tradition [[G3862]] of the [[G3588]] elders? [[G4245]] They do not wash [[G3538]] their [[G846]] hands [[G5495]] when [[G3752]] they eat.” [[G2068]]

### 3
[Jesus] replied, [[G611]] “And [[G2532]] why [[G1223]] {do} you [[G4771]] break [[G3845]] the [[G3588]] command [[G1785]] of God [[G2316]] for the sake of [[G1223]] your [[G4771]] tradition? [[G3862]]

### 4
For [[G1063]] God [[G2316]] said: [[G2036]] ‘Honor [[G5091]] [your] [[G3588]] father [[G3962]] and [[G2532]] mother’ [[G3384]] and [[G2532]] ‘Anyone who [[G3588]] curses [[G2551]] [his] father [[G3962]] or [[G2228]] mother [[G3384]] must be put to death.’ [[G5053]]

### 5
But [[G1161]] you [[G4771]] say that [[G3004]] if anyone [[G3739]] says [[G2036]] to [his] [[G3588]] father [[G3962]] or [[G2228]] mother, [[G3384]] ‘[The help] [[G3739]] you would have received [[G5623]] from [[G1537]] me [[G1473]] has been given to God,’ [[G1435]]

### 6
he need not honor [[G5091]] his [[G846]] father [[G3962]] or [[G2228]] mother [with it]. [[G3384]] Thus [[G2532]] you nullify [[G208]] the [[G3588]] word [[G3056]] of God [[G2316]] for the sake of [[G1223]] your [[G4771]] tradition. [[G3862]]

### 7
You hypocrites! [[G5273]] Isaiah [[G2268]] prophesied [[G4395]] correctly [[G2573]] about [[G4012]] you [[G4771]] : [[G3004]]

### 8
‘These [[G3778]] people [[G2992]] honor [[G5091]] Me [[G1473]] with their [[G3588]] lips, [[G5491]] but [[G1161]] their [[G846]] hearts [[G2588]] are far [[G568]] from [[G575]] Me. [[G1473]]

### 9
They worship [[G4576]] Me [[G1473]] in vain; [[G3155]] they teach [as] [[G1321]] doctrine [[G1319]] [the] precepts [[G1778]] of men.’” [[G444]]

### 10
[Jesus] called [[G4341]] the [[G3588]] crowd [to Him] [[G3793]] [and] said, [[G2036]] “Listen [[G191]] and [[G2532]] understand. [[G4920]]

### 11
A [[G3588]] man [[G444]] is not defiled [[G2840]] by what [[G3588]] enters [[G1525]] [his] [[G3588]] mouth, [[G4750]] but [[G235]] by what [[G3588]] comes [[G1607]] out of [[G1537]] [it].” [[G4750]]

### 12
Then [[G5119]] the [[G3588]] disciples [[G3101]] came [[G4334]] to Him [[G846]] [and] said, [[G3004]] “Are You aware [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] the [[G3588]] Pharisees [[G5330]] were offended [[G4624]] when they heard [[G191]] this?” [[G3588]]

### 13
But [[G1161]] [Jesus] replied, [[G611]] “Every [[G3956]] plant [[G5451]] that [[G3739]] My [[G1473]] Heavenly [[G3770]] Father [[G3962]] has not planted [[G5452]] will be pulled up by its roots. [[G1610]]

### 14
Disregard [[G863]] them! [[G846]] They are [[G1510]] blind [[G5185]] guides. [[G3595]] If [[G1437]] [a] blind [man] [[G5185]] leads [[G3594]] [a] blind [man], [[G5185]] both [[G297]] will fall [[G4098]] into [[G1519]] a pit.” [[G999]]

### 15
Peter [[G4074]] said [[G611]] to Him, [[G846]] “Explain [[G5419]] this [[G3778]] parable [[G3850]] to us.” [[G1473]]

### 16
“Do [[G1510]] you [[G4771]] still [[G188]] not understand?” [[G801]] [Jesus] asked. [[G2036]]

### 17
“Do you not yet realize [[G3539]] that [[G3754]] whatever [[G3956]] enters [[G1531]] the [[G3588]] mouth [[G4750]] goes [[G5562]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] stomach [[G2836]] and then [[G2532]] is eliminated? [[G1544]]

### 18
But [[G1161]] the things [[G3588]] that come [[G1607]] out of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] mouth [[G4750]] come [[G1831]] from [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] heart, [[G2588]] and these things [[G2548]] defile [[G2840]] a [[G3588]] man. [[G444]]

### 19
For [[G1063]] out of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] heart [[G2588]] come [[G1831]] evil [[G4190]] thoughts, [[G1261]] murder, [[G5408]] adultery, [[G3430]] sexual immorality, [[G4202]] theft, [[G2829]] false testimony, [[G5577]] [and] slander. [[G988]]

### 20
These [[G3778]] are [[G1510]] what [[G3588]] defile [[G2840]] a [[G3588]] man, [[G444]] but [[G1161]] eating [[G5315]] with unwashed [[G449]] hands [[G5495]] does not defile [[G2840]] [him].” [[G444]]

### 21
Leaving [[G1831]] that place, [[G1564]] Jesus [[G2424]] withdrew [[G402]] to [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] district [[G3313]] of Tyre [[G5184]] and [[G2532]] Sidon. [[G4605]]

### 22
And [[G2532]] a Canaanite [[G5478]] woman [[G1135]] from [[G575]] that [[G1565]] region [[G3725]] came [to Him], [[G1831]] crying out, [[G2896]] “Lord, [[G2962]] Son [[G5207]] of David, [[G1138]] have mercy on [[G1653]] me! [[G1473]] My [[G1473]] daughter [[G2364]] {is} miserably [[G2560]] possessed by a demon.” [[G1139]]

### 23
But [[G1161]] [Jesus] did not answer [[G611]] a word. [[G3056]] So [[G2532]] His [[G846]] disciples [[G3101]] came [[G4334]] [and] urged [[G2065]] Him, [[G846]] “Send her away, [[G630]] for [[G3754]] she keeps crying out [[G2896]] after [[G3693]] us.” [[G1473]]

### 24
He answered, [[G611]] “I was sent [[G649]] only [[G1487]] to [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] lost [[G622]] sheep [[G4263]] of [the] house [[G3624]] of Israel.” [[G2474]]

### 25
[The woman] came [[G2064]] [and] knelt before [[G4352]] him. [[G846]] “Lord, [[G2962]] help [[G997]] me!” [[G1473]] she said. [[G3004]]

### 26
But [[G1161]] [Jesus] replied, [[G611]] “It is [[G1510]] not [[G3756]] right [[G2570]] to take [[G2983]] the [[G3588]] children’s [[G5043]] bread [[G740]] and [[G2532]] toss [it] [[G906]] to the [[G3588]] dogs.” [[G2952]]

### 27
“Yes, [[G3483]] Lord,” [[G2962]] she said, [[G2036]] “even [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] dogs [[G2952]] eat [[G2068]] the [[G3588]] crumbs [[G5589]] that fall [[G4098]] from [[G575]] their [[G846]] master’s [[G2962]] table.” [[G5132]]

### 28
“O [[G5599]] woman,” [[G1135]] Jesus [[G2424]] answered, [[G611]] “your [[G4771]] faith [[G4102]] is great! [[G3173]] Let it be done [[G1096]] for you [[G4771]] as [[G5613]] you desire.” [[G2309]] And [[G2532]] her [[G846]] daughter [[G2364]] was healed [[G2390]] from [[G575]] that [[G3588]] very [[G1565]] hour. [[G5610]]

### 29
Moving on [[G3327]] from there, [[G1564]] Jesus [[G2424]] went [[G2064]] along [[G3844]] the [[G3588]] Sea [[G2281]] of Galilee. [[G1056]] Then [[G2532]] He went up [[G305]] on [[G1519]] a mountain [[G3735]] [and] sat [[G2521]] down. [[G1563]]

### 30
Large [[G4183]] crowds [[G3793]] came [[G4334]] to Him, [[G846]] bringing [[G2192]] [the] lame, [[G5560]] [the] blind, [[G5185]] [the] crippled, [[G2948]] [the] mute, [[G2974]] and [[G2532]] many [[G4183]] others, [[G2087]] and [[G2532]] laid [[G4496]] them [[G846]] at [[G3844]] His [[G846]] feet, [[G4228]] and [[G2532]] He healed [[G2323]] them. [[G846]]

### 31
The [[G3588]] crowd [[G3793]] was amazed [[G2296]] when they saw [[G991]] [the] mute [[G2974]] speaking, [[G2980]] [the] crippled [[G2948]] restored, [[G5199]] [the] lame [[G5560]] walking, [[G4043]] and [[G2532]] [the] blind [[G5185]] seeing. [[G991]] And [[G2532]] they glorified [[G1392]] the [[G3588]] God [[G2316]] of Israel. [[G2474]]

### 32
Then [[G1161]] Jesus [[G2424]] called [[G4341]] His [[G846]] disciples [to Him] [[G3101]] [and] said, [[G2036]] “I have compassion [[G4697]] for [[G1909]] [this] [[G3588]] crowd, [[G3793]] because [[G3754]] they have already been [[G4357]] with Me [[G1473]] three [[G5140]] days [[G2250]] and [[G2532]] have [[G2192]] nothing [[G3756]] to eat. [[G5315]] I do not want [[G2309]] to send them away [[G630]] hungry, [[G3523]] or [[G4219]] they may faint [[G1590]] along [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] way. [[G3598]]

### 33
The [[G3588]] disciples [[G3101]] replied, [[G3004]] “Where [[G4159]] in [[G1722]] this desolate place [[G2047]] can we [find] [[G1473]] enough [[G5118]] bread [[G740]] to feed [[G5526]] such a large [[G5118]] crowd?” [[G3793]]

### 34
“How many [[G4214]] loaves [[G740]] do you have?” [[G2192]] Jesus [[G2424]] asked. [[G3004]] “Seven,” [[G2033]] they replied, [[G2036]] “and [[G2532]] a few [[G3641]] small fish.” [[G2485]]

### 35
And [[G2532]] He directed [[G3853]] the [[G3588]] crowd [[G3793]] to sit down [[G377]] on [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] ground. [[G1093]]

### 36
Taking [[G2983]] the [[G3588]] seven [[G2033]] loaves [[G740]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] fish, [[G2486]] He gave thanks [[G2168]] [and] broke [them]. [[G2806]] Then [[G2532]] He gave [them] [[G1325]] to [[G3588]] [the] disciples, [[G3101]] and [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] disciples [[G3101]] [gave them] to the [[G3588]] people. [[G3793]]

### 37
They all [[G3956]] ate [[G5315]] and [[G2532]] were satisfied, [[G5526]] and [[G2532]] [the disciples] picked up [[G142]] seven [[G2033]] basketfuls [[G4711]] of broken pieces [[G2801]] that [[G3588]] were left over. [[G4052]]

### 38
A total of [[G3588]] four thousand [[G5070]] men [[G435]] were [[G1510]] fed, [[G2068]] in addition to [[G5565]] women [[G1135]] and [[G2532]] children. [[G3813]]

### 39
After [[G2532]] [Jesus] had dismissed [[G630]] the [[G3588]] crowds, [[G3793]] He got into [[G1684]] the [[G3588]] boat [[G4143]] and [[G2532]] went [[G2064]] to [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] region [[G3725]] of Magadan. [[G3093]]
