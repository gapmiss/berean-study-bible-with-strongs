In [[G1722]] those [[G1565]] days [[G2250]] John [[G2491]] the [[G3588]] Baptist [[G910]] came, [[G3854]] preaching [[G2784]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] wilderness [[G2048]] of Judea [[G2449]]

### 2
and [[G2532]] saying, [[G3004]] “Repent, [[G3340]] for [[G1063]] the [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] of [[G3588]] heaven [[G3772]] is near.” [[G1448]]

### 3
This [[G3778]] is [[G1510]] he who [[G3588]] was spoken of [[G2046]] through [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] prophet [[G4396]] Isaiah: [[G2268]] “[A] voice [[G5456]] of one calling [[G994]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] wilderness, [[G2048]] ‘Prepare [[G2090]] the [[G3588]] way [[G3598]] for [the] Lord, [[G2962]] make [[G4160]] straight [[G2117]] paths [[G5147]] for Him. [[G846]]

### 4
John [[G2491]] wore [[G2192]] a garment [[G1742]] of [[G575]] camel’s [[G2574]] hair, [[G2359]] with [[G2532]] [a] leather [[G1193]] belt [[G2223]] around [[G4012]] his [[G846]] waist. [[G3751]] His [[G846]] food [[G5160]] was [[G1510]] locusts [[G200]] and [[G2532]] wild [[G66]] honey. [[G3192]]

### 5
[People] went out [[G1607]] to [[G4314]] him [[G846]] [from] Jerusalem [[G2414]] and [[G2532]] all [[G3956]] Judea [[G2449]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] whole [[G3956]] region around [[G4066]] the [[G3588]] Jordan. [[G2446]]

### 6
Confessing [[G1843]] their [[G846]] sins, [[G266]] they were baptized [[G907]] by [[G5259]] him [[G846]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] Jordan [[G2446]] River. [[G4215]]

### 7
But when [[G1161]] [John] saw [[G3708]] many [[G4183]] of the [[G3588]] Pharisees [[G5330]] and [[G2532]] Sadducees [[G4523]] coming [[G2064]] to [[G1909]] his [place of] [[G846]] baptism, [[G908]] he said [[G2036]] to them, [[G846]] “[You] brood [[G1081]] of vipers, [[G2191]] who [[G5101]] warned [[G5263]] you [[G4771]] to flee [[G5343]] from [[G575]] the [[G3588]] coming [[G3195]] wrath? [[G3709]]

### 8
Produce [[G4160]] fruit [[G2590]] worthy [[G514]] of repentance. [[G3341]]

### 9
And [[G2532]] {do} not [[G3361]] presume [[G1380]] to say [[G3004]] to [[G1722]] yourselves, [[G1438]] ‘We have [[G2192]] Abraham [[G11]] [as our] father.’ [[G3962]] For [[G1063]] I tell [[G3004]] you [[G4771]] that [[G3754]] out of [[G1537]] these [[G3778]] stones [[G3037]] God [[G2316]] can [[G1410]] raise up [[G1453]] children [[G5043]] for [[G3588]] Abraham. [[G11]]

### 10
The [[G3588]] ax [[G513]] lies ready [[G2749]] at [[G4314]] the [[G3588]] root [[G4491]] of the [[G3588]] trees, [[G1186]] and [[G3767]] every [[G3956]] tree [[G1186]] that does not produce [[G4160]] good [[G2570]] fruit [[G2590]] will be cut down [[G1581]] and [[G2532]] thrown [[G906]] into [[G1519]] [the] fire. [[G4442]]

### 11
I [[G1473]] baptize [[G907]] you [[G4771]] with [[G1722]] water [[G5204]] for [[G1519]] repentance, [[G3341]] but [[G1161]] after [[G3694]] me [[G1473]] will come [[G2064]] [One] [[G1510]] more powerful [[G2478]] than I, [[G1473]] whose [[G3739]] sandals [[G5266]] I am [[G1510]] not [[G3756]] worthy [[G2425]] to carry. [[G941]] He [[G846]] will baptize [[G907]] you [[G4771]] with [[G1722]] [the] Holy [[G40]] Spirit [[G4151]] and [[G2532]] with fire. [[G4442]]

### 12
His [[G3739]] winnowing fork [is] [[G4425]] in [[G1722]] His [[G846]] hand [[G5495]] to clear [[G1245]] His [[G846]] threshing floor [[G257]] and [[G2532]] to gather [[G4863]] His [[G846]] wheat [[G4621]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] barn; [[G596]] but [[G1161]] He will burn up [[G2618]] the [[G3588]] chaff [[G892]] with unquenchable [[G762]] fire. [[G4442]]

### 13
At that time [[G5119]] Jesus [[G2424]] came [[G3854]] from [[G575]] Galilee [[G1056]] to [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] Jordan [[G2446]] to be baptized [[G907]] by [[G5259]] [John]. [[G846]]

### 14
But [[G1161]] John [[G2491]] tried to prevent [[G1254]] Him, [[G846]] saying, [[G3004]] “I [[G1473]] need [[G5532]] to be baptized [[G907]] by [[G5259]] You, [[G4771]] and [[G2532]] {do} You [[G4771]] come [[G2064]] to [[G4314]] me?” [[G1473]]

### 15
“Let [it] be so [[G863]] now,” [[G737]] Jesus [[G2424]] replied. [[G611]] “It is [[G1510]] fitting [[G4241]] for us [[G1473]] to fulfill [[G4137]] all [[G3956]] righteousness [[G1343]] in this way.” [[G3779]] Then [[G5119]] [John] permitted [[G863]] Him. [[G846]]

### 16
As soon as [[G1161]] [Jesus] was baptized, [[G907]] He [[G2424]] went up [[G305]] out of [[G575]] the [[G3588]] water. [[G5204]] Suddenly [[G2400]] the [[G3588]] heavens [[G3772]] were opened, [[G455]] and [[G2532]] He saw [[G3708]] the [[G3588]] Spirit [[G4151]] of [[G3588]] God [[G2316]] descending [[G2597]] like [[G5616]] a dove [[G4058]] and [[G2532]] resting [[G2064]] on [[G1909]] Him. [[G846]]

### 17
And [[G2532]] a voice [[G5456]] from [[G1537]] heaven [[G3772]] said, [[G3004]] “This [[G3778]] is [[G1510]] My [[G1473]] beloved [[G27]] Son, [[G5207]] in [[G1722]] whom [[G3739]] I am well pleased!” [[G2106]]
