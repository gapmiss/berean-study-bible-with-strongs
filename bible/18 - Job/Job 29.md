[[Job 28|←]] • [[Job 30|→]]

### 1
Again, Job [[H347]] continued [[H3254]] his discourse [[H4912]] and said: [[H559]]

### 2
“How I long for [[H4310]] the months [[H3391]] gone by, [[H6924]] for the days [[H3117]] when God [[H433]] watched over me, [[H8104]]

### 3
when His lamp [[H5216]] shone [[H1984]] above [[H5921]] my head, [[H7218]] and by His light [[H216]] I walked [[H1980]] through the darkness, [[H2822]]

### 4
when [[H834]] I was [[H1961]] in the days [[H3117]] of my youth, [[H2779]] when the friendship [[H5475]] of God [[H433]] rested on [[H5921]] my tent, [[H168]]

### 5
when the Almighty [[H7706]] was still [[H5750]] with me [[H5978]] and my children [[H5288]] were around me, [[H5439]]

### 6
when my steps [[H1978]] were bathed [[H7364]] in cream [[H2529]] and the rock [[H6697]] poured out [[H6694]] for me [[H5978]] streams [[H6388]] of oil! [[H8081]]

### 7
When I went out [[H3318]] to the city [[H7176]] gate [[H8179]] and took [[H3559]] my seat [[H4186]] in the public square, [[H7339]]

### 8
the young men [[H5288]] saw me [[H7200]] and withdrew, [[H2244]] and the old men [[H3453]] rose [[H6965]] to their feet. [[H5975]]

### 9
The princes [[H8269]] refrained [[H6113]] from speaking [[H4405]] and covered [[H7760]] their mouths [[H6310]] with their hands. [[H3709]]

### 10
The voices [[H6963]] of the nobles [[H5057]] were hushed, [[H2244]] and their tongues [[H3956]] stuck [[H1692]] to the roofs of their mouths. [[H2441]]

### 11
For [[H3588]] those [[H241]] who heard me [[H8085]] called me blessed, [[H833]] and those who [[H5869]] saw me [[H7200]] commended me, [[H5749]]

### 12
because [[H3588]] I rescued [[H4422]] the poor [[H6041]] who cried out [[H7768]] and the fatherless [[H3490]] who had no [[H3808]] helper. [[H5826]]

### 13
The dying man [[H6]] blessed me, [[H1293]] and I made the widow’s [[H490]] heart [[H3820]] sing for joy. [[H7442]]

### 14
I put on [[H3847]] righteousness, [[H6664]] and it clothed me; [[H3847]] justice [[H4941]] was my robe [[H4598]] and turban. [[H6797]]

### 15
I [served as] [[H1961]] eyes [[H5869]] to the blind [[H5787]] [and] [[H589]] as feet [[H7272]] to the lame. [[H6455]]

### 16
I [[H595]] was a father [[H1]] to the needy, [[H34]] and I took up [[H2713]] the case [[H7379]] of the stranger. [[H3808]]

### 17
I shattered [[H7665]] the fangs [[H4973]] of the unjust [[H5767]] and snatched [[H7993]] the prey [[H2964]] from his teeth. [[H8127]]

### 18
So I thought: [[H559]] ‘I will die [[H1478]] in [[H5973]] my nest [[H7064]] and multiply [[H7235]] my days [[H3117]] as the sand. [[H2344]]

### 19
My roots [[H8328]] [will] spread out [[H6605]] to [[H413]] the waters, [[H4325]] and the dew [[H2919]] will rest nightly [[H3885]] on my branches. [[H7105]]

### 20
My glory [[H3519]] is [ever] new [[H2319]] within me, [[H5978]] and my bow [[H7198]] is renewed [[H2498]] in my hand. [[H3027]]

### 21
Men listened [[H8085]] to me  with expectation, [[H3176]] waiting silently [[H1826]] for [[H3926]] my counsel. [[H6098]]

### 22
After [[H310]] my words, [[H1697]] they spoke [[H8138]] no more; [[H3808]] my speech [[H4405]] settled [[H5197]] on them like dew. [[H5921]]

### 23
They waited [[H3176]] for me as for rain [[H4306]] and drank in my words [[H6473]] like spring showers. [[H4456]]

### 24
If I smiled [[H7832]] at them, [[H413]] they did not [[H3808]] believe it; [[H539]] the light [[H216]] of my countenance [[H6440]] was precious. [[H5307]]

### 25
I chose [[H977]] their course [[H1870]] and presided [[H3427]] as chief. [[H7218]] So I dwelt [[H7931]] as a king [[H4428]] among his troops, [[H1416]] as a comforter [[H834]] of mourners. [[H57]]
