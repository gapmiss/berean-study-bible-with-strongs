###### 1
But [[H199]] now, [[H4994]] Job, [[H347]] hear [[H8085]] my speech, [[H4405]] and listen [[H238]] to all [[H3605]] my words. [[H1697]]

###### 2
Behold [[H2009]] now, [[H4994]] I will open [[H6605]] my mouth; [[H6310]] what I speak [[H1696]] is on the tip [[H2441]] of my tongue. [[H3956]]

###### 3
My words [[H561]] are from an upright [[H3476]] heart, [[H3820]] and my lips [[H8193]] speak [[H4448]] sincerely [[H1305]] what I know. [[H1847]]

###### 4
The Spirit [[H7307]] of God [[H410]] has made me, [[H6213]] and the breath [[H5397]] of the Almighty [[H7706]] gives me life. [[H2421]]

###### 5
Refute [[H7725]] me if [[H518]] you can; [[H3201]] prepare your case [[H6186]] and confront me. [[H6440]]

###### 6
I [[H589]] am just like you before God; [[H410]] I [[H589]] was also [[H1571]] formed [[H7169]] out of clay. [[H2563]]

###### 7
Surely [[H2009]] no [[H3808]] fear of me [[H367]] should terrify you; [[H1204]] nor [[H3808]] will my hand [[H405]] be heavy [[H3513]] upon you. [[H5921]]

###### 8
Surely [[H389]] you have spoken [[H559]] in my hearing, [[H241]] and I have heard [[H8085]] these very words: [[H4405]]

###### 9
‘I [[H589]] am pure, [[H2134]] without [[H1097]] transgression; [[H6588]] I [[H595]] am clean, [[H2643]] with no [[H3808]] iniquity [[H5771]] in me. 

###### 10
Yet [[H2005]] He finds [[H4672]] occasions [[H8569]] against me; [[H5921]] He counts me [[H2803]] as His  enemy. [[H341]]

###### 11
He puts [[H7760]] my feet [[H7272]] in the stocks; [[H5465]] He watches over [[H8104]] all [[H3605]] my paths.’ [[H734]]

###### 12
Behold, [[H2005]] you are not [[H3808]] right [[H6663]] in this matter. [[H2063]] I will answer you, [[H6030]] for [[H3588]] God [[H433]] is greater [[H7235]] than man. [[H582]]

###### 13
Why [[H4069]] do you contend [[H7378]] with Him [[H413]] that [[H3588]] He answers [[H6030]] nothing [[H3808]] a man asks? [[H1697]]

###### 14
For [[H3588]] God [[H410]] speaks [[H1696]] in one [way] [[H259]] and in another, [[H8147]] [yet] no one [[H3808]] notices. [[H7789]]

###### 15
In a dream, [[H2472]] in a vision [[H2384]] in the night, [[H3915]] when deep sleep [[H8639]] falls [[H5307]] upon [[H5921]] men [[H376]] as they slumber [[H8572]] on [[H5921]] their beds, [[H4904]]

###### 16
He opens [[H1540]] their ears [[H241]] at that time [[H227]] and terrifies [[H2856]] them with warnings, [[H4561]]

###### 17
in order to turn [[H5493]] a man [[H120]] from wrongdoing [[H4639]] and keep [[H3680]] him from [[H1397]] pride, [[H1466]]

###### 18
to preserve [[H2820]] his soul [[H5315]] from [[H4480]] the Pit, [[H7845]] and his life [[H2416]] from perishing [[H5674]] by the sword. [[H7973]]

###### 19
A man is also chastened [[H3198]] on [[H5921]] his bed [[H4904]] with pain [[H4341]] and constant [[H386]] distress [[H7379]] in his bones, [[H6106]]

###### 20
so that he [[H2416]] detests [[H2092]] his bread, [[H3899]] and his soul [[H5315]] [loathes] his favorite [[H8378]] food. [[H3978]]

###### 21
His flesh [[H1320]] wastes away [[H3615]] from sight, [[H7210]] and his hidden [[H3808]] bones [[H6106]] protrude. [[H8205]]

###### 22
He [[H5315]] draws near [[H7126]] to the Pit, [[H7845]] and his life [[H2416]] to the messengers of death. [[H4191]]

###### 23
Yet if [[H518]] there is [[H3426]] a messenger [[H4397]] on his side, [[H5921]] one [[H259]] mediator [[H3887]] out of [[H4480]] a thousand, [[H505]] to tell [[H5046]] a man [[H120]] what is right for him, [[H3476]]

###### 24
to be gracious [[H2603]] to him and say, [[H559]] ‘Spare him [[H6308]] from going down [[H3381]] to the Pit; [[H7845]] I have found [[H4672]] his ransom,’ [[H3724]]

###### 25
then his flesh [[H1320]] will be renewed [[H7375]] like a child’s, [[H5290]] and he will return [[H7725]] to the days [[H3117]] of his youth. [[H5934]]

###### 26
He will pray [[H6279]] to [[H413]] God [[H433]] and find favor; [[H7521]] he will see [[H7200]] His face [[H6440]] and shout for joy, [[H8643]] and God will restore [[H7725]] the righteousness [[H6666]] of that man. [[H582]]

###### 27
Then he will sing [[H7789]] before [[H5921]] men [[H582]] with these words: [[H559]] ‘I have sinned [[H2398]] and perverted [[H5753]] what was right; [[H3477]] yet I did not [[H3808]] get what I deserved. [[H7737]]

###### 28
He redeemed [[H6299]] my soul [[H5315]] from going down [[H5674]] to the Pit, [[H7845]] and I will live [[H2416]] to see [[H7200]] the light.’ [[H216]]

###### 29
Behold, [[H2005]] all [[H3605]] these things [[H428]] God [[H410]] does [[H6466]] to [[H5973]] a man, [[H1397]] two [[H6471]] or even three times, [[H7969]]

###### 30
to bring back [[H7725]] his soul [[H5315]] from [[H4480]] the Pit, [[H7845]] that he may be enlightened [[H215]] with the light [[H216]] of life. [[H2416]]

###### 31
Pay attention, [[H7181]] Job, [[H347]] and listen to me; [[H8085]] be silent, [[H2790]] and I [[H595]] will speak. [[H1696]]

###### 32
But if [[H518]] you have [[H3426]] something to say, [[H4405]] answer me; [[H7725]] speak up, [[H1696]] for [[H3588]] I would like [[H2654]] to vindicate you. [[H6663]]

###### 33
But if [[H518]] not, [[H369]] then listen [[H8085]] to me;  be quiet, [[H2790]] and I will teach [[H502]] you wisdom.” [[H2451]]
