### 1
Then Job [[H347]] answered: [[H6030]]

### 2
“How [[H4100]] you have helped [[H5826]] the powerless [[H3808]] and saved [[H3467]] the arm [[H2220]] that is feeble! [[H3808]]

### 3
How [[H4100]] you have counseled [[H3289]] the unwise [[H3808]] and provided [[H3045]] fully sound [[H7230]] insight! [[H8454]]

### 4
To [[H854]] whom [[H4310]] have you uttered [[H5046]] these words? [[H4405]] And whose [[H4310]] spirit [[H5397]] spoke [[H3318]] through you? [[H4480]]

### 5
The dead [[H7496]] tremble— [[H2342]] those who dwell [[H7931]] beneath [[H8478]] the waters. [[H4325]]

### 6
Sheol [[H7585]] is naked [[H6174]] before Him, [[H5048]] and Abaddon [[H11]] has no [[H369]] covering. [[H3682]]

### 7
He stretches out [[H5186]] the north [[H6828]] over [[H5921]] empty space; [[H8414]] He hangs [[H8518]] the earth [[H776]] upon [[H5921]] nothing. [[H1099]]

### 8
He wraps up [[H6887]] the waters [[H4325]] in His clouds, [[H5645]] yet the clouds [[H6051]] do not [[H3808]] burst [[H1234]] under their own weight. [[H8478]]

### 9
He covers [[H270]] the face [[H6440]] of the full moon, [[H3678]] spreading [[H6576]] His cloud [[H6051]] over it. [[H5921]]

### 10
He has inscribed [[H2328]] a horizon [[H2706]] on [[H5921]] the face [[H6440]] of the waters [[H4325]] at [[H5704]] the boundary [[H8503]] between [[H5973]] light [[H216]] and darkness. [[H2822]]

### 11
The foundations [[H5982]] of heaven [[H8064]] quake, [[H7322]] astounded [[H8539]] at His rebuke. [[H1606]]

### 12
By His power [[H3581]] He stilled [[H7280]] the sea, [[H3220]] and by His understanding [[H8394]] He shattered [[H4272]] Rahab. [[H7293]]

### 13
By His breath [[H7307]] the skies [[H8064]] were cleared; [[H8235]] His hand [[H3027]] pierced [[H2490]] the fleeing [[H1281]] serpent. [[H5175]]

### 14
Indeed, [[H2005]] these [are] [[H428]] but the fringes [[H7098]] of His ways; [[H1870]] how [[H4100]] faint [[H8102]] is the whisper [[H1697]] we hear [[H8085]] of Him!  Who then [[H4310]] can understand [[H995]] the thunder [[H7482]] of His power?” [[H1369]]
