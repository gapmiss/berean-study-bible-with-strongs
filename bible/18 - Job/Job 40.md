[[Job 39|←]] • [[Job 41|→]]

### 1
And the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H6030]] to Job: [[H347]]

### 2
“Will the faultfinder [[H3250]] contend [[H7378]] with [[H5973]] the Almighty? [[H7706]] Let him who argues [[H3198]] with God [[H433]] give an answer.” [[H6030]]

### 3
Then Job [[H347]] answered [[H6030]] the LORD: [[H3068]]

### 4
“Behold, [[H2005]] I am insignificant. [[H7043]] How [[H4100]] can I reply to You? [[H7725]] I place [[H7760]] my hand [[H3027]] over [[H3926]] my mouth. [[H6310]]

### 5
I have spoken [[H1696]] once, [[H259]] but I have no [[H3808]] answer— [[H6030]] twice, [[H8147]] but I have nothing [[H3808]] to add.” [[H3254]]

### 6
Then the LORD [[H3068]] answered [[H6030]] Job [[H347]] out of [[H4480]] the whirlwind [[H5591]] and said: [[H559]]

### 7
“Now [[H4994]] brace [[H247]] yourself [[H2504]] like a man; [[H1397]] I will question you, [[H7592]] and you shall answer Me. [[H3045]]

### 8
Would you really [[H637]] annul [[H6565]] My justice? [[H4941]] Would you condemn Me [[H7561]] to [[H4616]] justify yourself? [[H6663]]

### 9
Do you have an arm [[H2220]] like God’s? [[H410]] Can you thunder [[H7481]] with a voice [[H6963]] like His? [[H3644]]

### 10
Then [[H4994]] adorn yourself [[H5710]] [with] majesty [[H1347]] and splendor, [[H1363]] and clothe [[H3847]] yourself with honor [[H1935]] and glory. [[H1926]]

### 11
Unleash [[H6327]] the fury [[H5678]] of your wrath; [[H639]] look on [[H7200]] every [[H3605]] proud man [[H1343]] and bring him low. [[H8213]]

### 12
Look on [[H7200]] every [[H3605]] proud man [[H1343]] and humble him; [[H3665]] trample [[H1915]] the wicked [[H7563]] where they stand. [[H8478]]

### 13
Bury [[H2934]] them together [[H3162]] in the dust; [[H6083]] imprison them [[H2280]] in the grave. [[H2934]]

### 14
Then [[H1571]] I [[H589]] will confess to you [[H3034]] that [[H3588]] your own right hand [[H3225]] can save [[H3467]] you. 

### 15
Look at [[H2009]] Behemoth, [[H930]] which [[H834]] I made [[H6213]] [along] with you. [[H5973]] He feeds on [[H398]] grass [[H2682]] like an ox. [[H1241]]

### 16
See [[H2009]] the strength [[H3581]] of his loins [[H4975]] and the power [[H202]] in the muscles [[H8306]] of his belly. [[H990]]

### 17
His tail [[H2180]] sways [[H2654]] like [[H3644]] a cedar; [[H730]] the sinews [[H1517]] of  his thighs [[H6344]] are tightly knit. [[H8276]]

### 18
His bones [[H6106]] are tubes [[H650]] of bronze; [[H5154]] his limbs [[H1634]] are rods [[H4300]] of iron. [[H1270]]

### 19
He [[H1931]] is the foremost [[H7225]] of God’s [[H410]] works; [[H1870]] only his Maker [[H6213]] can draw the sword [[H2719]] against him. [[H5066]]

### 20
The hills [[H2022]] yield [[H5375]] him  their produce, [[H944]] while all [[H3605]] the beasts [[H2416]] of the field [[H7704]] play [[H7832]] nearby. [[H8033]]

### 21
He lies [[H7901]] under [[H8478]] the lotus plants, [[H6628]] hidden [[H5643]] among the reeds [[H7070]] of the marsh. [[H1207]]

### 22
The lotus plants [[H6628]] conceal him [[H5526]] in their shade; [[H6752]] the willows [[H6155]] of the brook [[H5158]] surround him. [[H5437]]

### 23
Though [[H2005]] the river [[H5104]] rages, [[H6231]] Behemoth is unafraid; [[H3808]] he remains secure, [[H982]] though [[H3588]] the Jordan [[H3383]] surges [[H1518]] to [[H413]] his mouth. [[H6310]]

### 24
Can anyone capture him [[H3947]] as he looks on, [[H5869]] or pierce [[H5344]] his nose [[H639]] with a snare? [[H4170]]
