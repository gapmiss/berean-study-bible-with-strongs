[[Esther 10|←]] • [[Job 2|→]]

### 1
There once was [[H1961]] a man [[H376]] in the land [[H776]] of Uz [[H5780]] whose name [was] [[H8034]] Job. [[H347]] And this man [[H376]] was blameless [[H8535]] and upright, [[H3477]] fearing [[H3373]] God [[H430]] and shunning [[H5493]] evil. [[H7451]]

### 2
He had seven [[H7651]] sons [[H1121]] and three [[H7969]] daughters, [[H1323]]

### 3
and he owned [[H4735]] 7,000 [[H7651]] sheep, [[H6629]] 3,000 [[H7969]] camels, [[H1581]] 500 [[H2568]] yoke [[H6776]] of oxen, [[H1241]] 500 [[H2568]] female donkeys, [[H860]] and a very [[H3966]] large number of [[H7227]] servants. [[H5657]] Job was [[H1961]] the [[H1931]] greatest [[H1419]] man [[H376]] of all [[H3605]] the people [[H1121]] of the east. [[H6924]]

### 4
[Job's] sons [[H1121]] would take turns [[H1980]] holding [[H6213]] feasts [[H4960]] in their homes, [[H1004]] and they would invite [[H7971]] their three [[H7969]] sisters [[H269]] to eat [[H398]] and drink [[H8354]] with them. [[H5973]]

### 5
And [[H1961]] when [[H3588]] the days [[H3117]] of feasting [[H4960]] were over, [[H5362]] Job [[H347]] would send [for his children] [[H7971]] to purify them, [[H6942]] rising early [[H7925]] in the morning [[H1242]] to offer [[H5927]] burnt offerings [[H5930]] for all of them. [[H3605]] For [[H3588]] Job [[H347]] thought, [[H559]] “Perhaps [[H194]] my children [[H1121]] have sinned [[H2398]] and cursed [[H1288]] God [[H430]] in their hearts. [[H3824]] This [[H3602]] was Jobs [[H347]] regular [[H3605]] practice. [[H6213]]

### 6
One day [[H3117]] the sons [[H1121]] of God [[H430]] came [[H935]] to present [[H3320]] themselves before [[H5921]] the LORD, [[H3068]] and Satan [[H7854]] also [[H1571]] came [[H935]] with them. [[H8432]]

### 7
“Where [[H370]] have you come from?” [[H935]] said [[H559]] the LORD [[H3069]] to [[H413]] Satan. [[H7854]] “From roaming [[H7751]] through the earth,” [[H776]] he [[H7854]] replied, [[H6030]] “and from walking back and forth [[H1980]] in it.” 

### 8
Then the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Satan, [[H7854]] “Have you considered [[H7760]] My servant [[H5650]] Job? [[H347]] For [[H3588]] [there is] no one [[H369]] on earth [[H776]] like him, [[H3644]] a man [[H376]] [who is] blameless [[H8535]] and upright, [[H3477]] who fears [[H3373]] God [[H430]] and shuns [[H5493]] evil.” [[H7451]]

### 9
Satan [[H7854]] answered [[H6030]] the LORD, [[H3068]] “Does Job [[H347]] fear [[H3372]] God [[H430]] for nothing? [[H2600]]

### 10
Have You not [[H3808]] placed a hedge [[H7753]] on every side [[H5439]] around him [[H1157]] and his household [[H1004]] and [[H1157]] all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] he owns?  You have blessed [[H1288]] the work [[H4639]] of his hands, [[H3027]] and his possessions [[H4735]] have increased [[H6555]] in the land. [[H776]]

### 11
But [[H199]] stretch out [[H7971]] Your hand [[H3027]] and strike [[H5060]] all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] he has,  and he will surely [[H518]] curse You [[H1288]] to [[H5921]] Your face.” [[H6440]]

### 12
“Very well,” [[H2009]] said [[H559]] the LORD [[H3068]] to [[H413]] Satan. [[H7854]] “Everything [[H3605]] he has [is]  in your hands, [[H3027]] but [[H7535]] you must not [[H408]] lay [[H7971]] a hand [[H3027]] on the man himself.” [[H413]] Then Satan [[H7854]] went out [[H3318]] from the presence [[H6440]] of the LORD. [[H3068]]

### 13
One day, [[H3117]] while Job’s sons [[H1121]] and daughters [[H1323]] were eating [[H398]] and drinking [[H8354]] wine [[H3196]] in their oldest [[H1060]] brother’s [[H251]] house, [[H1004]]

### 14
a messenger [[H4397]] came [[H935]] and reported [[H559]] to [[H413]] Job: [[H347]] “While the oxen [[H1241]] were [[H1961]] plowing [[H2790]] and the donkeys [[H860]] grazing [[H7462]] nearby, [[H5921]]

### 15
the Sabeans [[H7614]] swooped down [[H5307]] and took them away. [[H3947]] They struck down [[H5221]] the servants [[H5288]] with the sword, [[H2719]] and I [[H589]] alone [[H905]] have escaped [[H4422]] to tell [[H5046]] you!” 

### 16
While he [[H2088]] was still [[H5750]] speaking, [[H1696]] another [[H2088]] messenger came [[H935]] and reported: [[H559]] “The fire [[H784]] of God [[H430]] fell [[H5307]] from [[H4480]] heaven. [[H8064]] It burned [[H1197]] and consumed [[H398]] the sheep [[H6629]] and the servants, [[H5288]] and I [[H589]] alone [[H905]] have escaped [[H4422]] to tell [[H5046]] you! 

### 17
While he [[H5750]] was still [[H2088]] speaking, [[H1696]] another [messenger] [[H2088]] came [[H935]] and reported: [[H559]] “The Chaldeans [[H3778]] formed [[H7760]] three [[H7969]] bands, [[H7218]] raided [[H6584]] the camels, [[H1581]] and took them away. [[H3947]] They struck down [[H5221]] the servants [[H5288]] with the sword, [[H2719]] and I [[H589]] alone [[H905]] have escaped [[H4422]] to tell [[H5046]] you! 

### 18
While [[H5704]] he [[H2088]] was still speaking, [[H1696]] another messenger [[H2088]] came [[H935]] and reported: [[H559]] “Your sons [[H1121]] and daughters [[H1323]] were eating [[H398]] and drinking [[H8354]] wine [[H3196]] in their oldest [[H1060]] brother’s [[H251]] house, [[H1004]]

### 19
when suddenly [[H2009]] a mighty [[H1419]] wind [[H7307]] swept in [[H935]] from [[H5676]] the desert [[H4057]] and struck [[H5060]] the four [[H702]] corners [[H6438]] of the house. [[H1004]] It collapsed [[H5307]] on [[H5921]] the young people [[H5288]] and they are dead, [[H4191]] and I [[H589]] alone [[H905]] have escaped [[H4422]] to tell [[H5046]] you!” 

### 20
Then Job [[H347]] stood up, [[H6965]] tore [[H7167]] his robe, [[H4598]] and shaved [[H1494]] his head. [[H7218]] He fell [[H5307]] to the ground [[H776]] and worshiped, [[H7812]]

### 21
saying: [[H559]] “Naked [[H6174]] I came [[H3318]] from my mother’s [[H517]] womb, [[H990]] and naked [[H6174]] I shall return. [[H7725]] The LORD [[H3068]] gave, [[H5414]] and the LORD [[H3068]] has taken away. [[H3947]] Blessed [[H1288]] be [[H1961]] the name [[H8034]] of the LORD.” [[H3068]]

### 22
In all [[H3605]] this, [[H2063]] Job [[H347]] did not [[H3808]] sin [[H2398]] or charge [[H5414]] God [[H430]] with wrongdoing. [[H8604]]
