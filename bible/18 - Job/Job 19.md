###### 1
Then Job [[H347]] answered: [[H6030]]

###### 2
“How long [[H5704]] will you torment [[H3013]] me [[H5315]] and crush me [[H1792]] with words? [[H4405]]

###### 3
Ten [[H6235]] times [[H6471]] now, [[H2088]] you have reproached me; [[H3637]] you shamelessly [[H954]] mistreat [[H1970]] me. 

###### 4
Even if [[H637]] I have truly gone astray, [[H7686]] my error [[H4879]] concerns [[H3885]] me alone. [[H854]]

###### 5
If [[H518]] indeed [[H551]] you would exalt [yourselves] [[H1431]] above me [[H5921]] and use my disgrace [[H2781]] against me, [[H5921]]

###### 6
then [[H645]] understand [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] it is God [[H433]] who has wronged me [[H5791]] and drawn His net [[H4686]] around [[H5362]] me. [[H5921]]

###### 7
Though [[H2005]] I cry out, [[H6817]] ‘Violence!’ [[H2555]] I get no [[H3808]] response; [[H6030]] though I call for help, [[H7768]] there is no [[H369]] justice. [[H4941]]

###### 8
He has blocked [[H1443]] my way [[H734]] so I cannot [[H3808]] pass; [[H5674]] He has veiled [[H5921]] my paths [[H5410]] with darkness. [[H2822]]

###### 9
He has stripped [[H6584]] me of my honor [[H3519]] and removed [[H5493]] the crown [[H5850]] from my head. [[H7218]]

###### 10
He tears me down [[H5422]] on every side [[H5439]] until I am gone; [[H1980]] He uproots [[H5265]] my hope [[H8615]] like a tree. [[H6086]]

###### 11
His anger [[H639]] burns [[H2734]] against me, [[H5921]] and He counts me [[H2803]] among His enemies. [[H6862]]

###### 12
His troops [[H1416]] advance [[H935]] together; [[H3162]] they construct [[H5549]] a ramp [[H1870]] against me [[H5921]] and encamp [[H2583]] around [[H5439]] my tent. [[H168]]

###### 13
He has removed [[H7368]] my brothers [[H251]] from [[H4480]] me; [[H5921]] my acquaintances [[H3045]] have abandoned me. [[H2114]]

###### 14
My kinsmen [[H7138]] have failed me, [[H2308]] and my friends [[H3045]] have forgotten me. [[H7911]]

###### 15
My guests [[H1004]] and maidservants [[H519]] count me [[H2803]] as a stranger; [[H2114]] I am [[H1961]] a foreigner [[H5237]] in their sight. [[H5869]]

###### 16
I call [[H7121]] for my servant, [[H5650]] but he does not [[H3808]] answer, [[H6030]] though I implore [[H2603]] him  with [[H1119]] my own mouth. [[H6310]]

###### 17
My breath [[H7307]] is repulsive [[H2114]] to my wife, [[H802]] and I am loathsome [[H2603]] to my own family. [[H1121]]

###### 18
Even [[H1571]] little boys [[H5759]] scorn [[H3988]] me;  when I appear, [[H6965]] they deride [[H1696]] me. 

###### 19
All [[H3605]] my best friends [[H4962]] despise me, [[H8581]] and those [[H2088]] I love [[H157]] have turned [[H2015]] against me. 

###### 20
My skin [[H5785]] and flesh [[H1320]] cling [[H1692]] to my bones; [[H6106]] I have escaped [[H4422]] by the skin [[H5785]] of my teeth. [[H8127]]

###### 21
Have pity on me, [[H2603]] my friends, [[H7453]] have pity, [[H2603]] for [[H3588]] the hand [[H3027]] of God [[H433]] has struck [[H5060]] me. 

###### 22
Why [[H4100]] do you persecute [[H7291]] me as [[H3644]] God does? [[H410]] Will you never [[H3808]] get enough [[H7646]] of my flesh? [[H1320]]

###### 23
I wish [[H4310]] that my words [[H4405]] were recorded [[H3789]] and inscribed [[H2710]] in a book, [[H5612]]

###### 24
by an iron [[H1270]] stylus [[H5842]] on lead, [[H5777]] or chiseled [[H2672]] in stone [[H6697]] forever. [[H5703]]

###### 25
But I [[H589]] know [[H3045]] that my Redeemer [[H1350]] lives, [[H2416]] and that at the last [[H314]] He will stand [[H6965]] upon [[H5921]] the earth. [[H6083]]

###### 26
Even after [[H310]] my skin [[H5785]] has been destroyed, [[H5362]] yet in my flesh [[H1320]] I will see [[H2372]] God. [[H433]]

###### 27
I [[H589]] will see [[H2372]] Him [[H834]] for myself;  my eyes [[H5869]] will behold Him, [[H7200]] and not [[H3808]] as a stranger. [[H2114]] How my heart [[H3629]] yearns [[H3615]] within me! [[H2436]]

###### 28
If [[H3588]] you say, [[H559]] ‘How [[H4100]] shall we persecute [[H7291]] him,  since the root [[H8328]] of the matter [[H1697]] lies [[H4672]] with him?’ 

###### 29
then you should fear [[H1481]] the sword [[H2719]] yourselves,  because [[H3588]] wrath [[H2534]] brings punishment [[H5771]] by the sword, [[H2719]] so that [[H4616]] you may know [[H3045]] [there is] a judgment.” [[H1779]]
