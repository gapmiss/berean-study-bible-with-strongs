[[Job 38|←]] • [[Job 40|→]]

---

###### 1
Do you know [[H3045]] when [[H6256]] mountain [[H5553]] goats [[H3277]] give birth? [[H3205]] Have you watched [[H8104]] the doe [[H355]] bear her fawn? [[H2342]]

###### 2
Can you count [[H5608]] the months [[H3391]] they are pregnant? [[H4390]] Do you know [[H3045]] the time [[H6256]] they give birth? [[H3205]]

###### 3
They crouch down [[H3766]] and bring forth [[H6398]] their young; [[H3206]] they deliver [[H7971]] their newborn. [[H2256]]

###### 4
Their young ones [[H1121]] thrive [[H2492]] and grow up [[H7235]] in the open field; [[H1250]] they leave [[H3318]] and do not [[H3808]] return. [[H7725]]

###### 5
Who [[H4310]] set [[H7971]] the wild donkey [[H6501]] free? [[H2670]] Who [[H4310]] released [[H6605]] the swift donkey [[H6171]] from the harness? [[H4147]]

###### 6
I made [[H7760]] the wilderness [[H6160]] his home [[H1004]] and the salt flats [[H4420]] his dwelling. [[H4908]]

###### 7
He scorns [[H7832]] the tumult [[H1995]] of the city [[H7151]] and never [[H3808]] hears [[H8085]] the shouts [[H8663]] of a driver. [[H5065]]

###### 8
He roams [[H3491]] the mountains [[H2022]] for pasture, [[H4829]] searching [[H1875]] for [[H310]] any [[H3605]] green thing. [[H3387]]

###### 9
Will the wild ox [[H7214]] consent [[H14]] to serve you? [[H5647]] Will he stay [[H3885]] by [[H5921]] your manger {at night}? [[H18]]

###### 10
Can you hold [[H7194]] [him] [[H7214]] to the furrow [[H8525]] with a harness? [[H5688]] Will he plow [[H7702]] the valleys [[H6010]] behind you? [[H310]]

###### 11
Can you rely [[H982]] on his  great [[H7227]] strength? [[H3581]] Will you leave [[H5800]] your hard work [[H3018]] to him? [[H413]]

###### 12
Can you trust [[H539]] him  to [[H3588]] bring in [[H7725]] your grain [[H2233]] and gather it [[H622]] to your threshing floor? [[H1637]]

###### 13
The wings [[H3671]] of the ostrich [[H7443]] flap joyfully, [[H5965]] but cannot [match] [[H518]] the pinions [[H84]] and feathers [[H5133]] of the stork. [[H2624]]

###### 14
For [[H3588]] she leaves [[H5800]] her eggs [[H1000]] on the ground [[H776]] and lets them warm [[H2552]] in [[H5921]] the sand. [[H6083]]

###### 15
She forgets [[H7911]] that [[H3588]] a foot [[H7272]] may crush them, [[H2115]] or a wild [[H7704]] animal [[H2416]] may trample them. [[H1758]]

###### 16
She treats her young [[H1121]] harshly, [[H7188]] as if not [[H3808]] her own,  with no [[H1097]] concern [[H6343]] that her labor [[H3018]] was in vain. [[H7385]]

###### 17
For [[H3588]] God [[H433]] has deprived her [[H5382]] of wisdom; [[H2451]] He has not [[H3808]] endowed [[H2505]] her  with understanding. [[H998]]

###### 18
Yet when [[H6256]] she proudly [[H4791]] spreads her wings, [[H4754]] she laughs [[H7832]] at the horse [[H5483]] and its rider. [[H7392]]

###### 19
Do you give [[H5414]] strength [[H1369]] to the horse [[H5483]] or adorn [[H3847]] his neck [[H6677]] with a mane? [[H7483]]

###### 20
Do you make him leap [[H7493]] like a locust, [[H697]] [striking] terror [[H367]] with his proud [[H1935]] snorting? [[H5170]]

###### 21
He paws [[H2658]] in the valley [[H6010]] and rejoices [[H7797]] in his strength; [[H3581]] he charges [[H3318]] into battle. [[H5402]]

###### 22
He laughs [[H7832]] at fear, [[H6343]] frightened [[H2865]] of nothing; [[H3808]] he does not [[H3808]] turn back [[H7725]] from [[H6440]] the sword. [[H2719]]

###### 23
A quiver [[H827]] rattles [[H7439]] at his side, [[H5921]] along with a flashing [[H3851]] spear [[H2595]] and lance. [[H3591]]

###### 24
Trembling [[H7494]] with excitement, [[H7267]] he devours [[H1572]] the distance; [[H776]] he cannot [[H3808]] stand still [[H539]] when the trumpet [[H7782]] sounds. [[H6963]]

###### 25
At [[H1767]] the [blast of] the trumpet, [[H7782]] he snorts [[H559]] with fervor! [[H1889]] He catches the scent [[H7306]] of battle [[H4421]] from afar, [[H7350]] the shouts [[H7482]] of captains [[H8269]] and the cry of battle. [[H8643]]

###### 26
Does the hawk [[H5322]] take flight [[H82]] by your understanding [[H998]] and spread [[H6566]] his wings [[H3671]] toward the south? [[H8486]]

###### 27
Does the eagle [[H5404]] soar [[H1361]] at [[H5921]] your command [[H6310]] and make his nest [[H7064]] on high? [[H7311]]

###### 28
He dwells [[H7931]] on a cliff [[H5553]] and lodges there; [[H3885]] his stronghold [[H4686]] is on [[H5921]] a rocky [[H5553]] crag. [[H8127]]

###### 29
From there [[H8033]] he spies [[H2658]] out food; [[H400]] his eyes [[H5869]] see [[H5027]] [it] from afar. [[H7350]]

###### 30
His young ones [[H667]] feast on [[H5966]] blood; [[H1818]] and where [[H834]] the slain [are], [[H2491]] there [[H8033]] he [is].” [[H1931]]
