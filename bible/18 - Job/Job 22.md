###### 1
Then Eliphaz [[H464]] the Temanite [[H8489]] replied: [[H6030]]

###### 2
“Can a man [[H1397]] be of use [[H5532]] to God? [[H410]] Can even [[H3588]] a wise man [[H7919]] benefit [[H5532]] Him? [[H5921]]

###### 3
Does it delight [[H2656]] the Almighty [[H7706]] that [[H3588]] you are righteous? [[H6663]] Does He profit [[H1215]] if [[H3588]] your ways [[H1870]] are blameless? [[H8552]]

###### 4
Is it for your reverence [[H3374]] that He rebukes you [[H3198]] and enters [[H935]] into judgment [[H4941]] against you? [[H5973]]

###### 5
Is not [[H3808]] your wickedness [[H7451]] great? [[H7227]] Are not your iniquities [[H5771]] endless? [[H369]]

###### 6
For [[H3588]] you demanded security [[H2254]] from your brothers [[H251]] without cause, [[H2600]] stripping off [[H6584]] their clothes [[H899]] and leaving them naked. [[H6174]]

###### 7
You gave [[H8248]] no [[H3808]] water [[H4325]] to the weary [[H5889]] and withheld [[H4513]] food [[H3899]] from the famished, [[H7456]]

###### 8
while the land [[H776]] belonged to a mighty [[H2220]] man, [[H376]] and a man [[H5375]] of honor [[H6440]] lived [[H3427]] on it. 

###### 9
You sent widows [[H490]] away [[H7971]] empty-handed, [[H7387]] and the strength [[H2220]] of the fatherless [[H3490]] was crushed. [[H1792]]

###### 10
Therefore [[H5921]] snares [[H6341]] surround you, [[H5439]] and sudden [[H6597]] peril [[H6343]] terrifies you; [[H926]]

###### 11
it is so dark [[H2822]] you cannot [[H3808]] see, [[H7200]] and a flood [[H8229]] of water [[H4325]] covers you. [[H3680]]

###### 12
Is not [[H3808]] God [[H433]] as high [[H1363]] as the heavens? [[H8064]] Look at [[H7200]] the highest [[H7218]] stars, [[H3556]] how [[H3588]] lofty they are! [[H7311]]

###### 13
Yet you say: [[H559]] ‘What [[H4100]] does God [[H410]] know? [[H3045]] Does He judge [[H8199]] through [[H1157]] thick darkness? [[H6205]]

###### 14
Clouds [[H5645]] veil [[H5643]] Him  so that He cannot [[H3808]] see, [[H7200]] as He traverses [[H1980]] heaven's [[H8064]] horizon.’ [[H2329]]

###### 15
Will you stay [[H8104]] on the ancient [[H5769]] path [[H734]] that [[H834]] wicked [[H205]] men [[H4962]] have trod? [[H1869]]

###### 16
They [[H834]] were snatched away [[H7059]] before [[H3808]] their time, [[H6256]] and their foundations [[H3247]] were swept away [[H3332]] by a river. [[H5104]]

###### 17
They said [[H559]] to God, [[H410]] ‘Depart [[H5493]] from us. [[H4480]] What [[H4100]] can the Almighty [[H7706]] do to us?’ [[H6466]]

###### 18
But it was He [[H1931]] who filled [[H4390]] their houses [[H1004]] with good things; [[H2896]] so I stay far [[H7368]] from the counsel [[H6098]] of the wicked. [[H7563]]

###### 19
The righteous [[H6662]] see [it] [[H7200]] and are glad; [[H8055]] the innocent [[H5355]] mock them, saying, [[H3932]]

###### 20
‘Surely [[H518]] our foes [[H7009]] are destroyed, [[H3582]] and fire [[H784]] has consumed [[H398]] their excess.’ [[H3499]]

###### 21
Reconcile [[H5532]] now [[H4994]] and be at peace [[H7999]] with Him; [[H5973]] thereby  good [[H2896]] will come to you. [[H935]]

###### 22
Receive [[H3947]] instruction [[H8451]] from His mouth, [[H6310]] and lay up [[H7760]] His words [[H561]] in your heart. [[H3824]]

###### 23
If [[H518]] you return [[H7725]] to [[H5704]] the Almighty, [[H7706]] you will be restored. [[H1129]] If you remove [[H7368]] injustice [[H5766]] from your tents [[H168]]

###### 24
and consign [[H7896]] your gold [[H1220]] to [[H5921]] the dust [[H6083]] and the gold of Ophir [[H211]] to the stones [[H6697]] of the ravines, [[H5158]]

###### 25
then the Almighty [[H7706]] will be [[H1961]] your gold [[H1220]] and the finest [[H8443]] silver [[H3701]] for you. 

###### 26
Surely [[H3588]] then [[H227]] you will delight [[H6026]] in [[H5921]] the Almighty [[H7706]] and lift up [[H5375]] your face [[H6440]] to [[H413]] God. [[H433]]

###### 27
You will pray [[H6279]] to Him, [[H413]] and He will hear you, [[H8085]] and you will fulfill [[H7999]] your vows. [[H5088]]

###### 28
Your decisions [[H1504]] will be carried out, [[H6965]] and light [[H216]] will shine [[H5050]] on [[H5921]] your ways. [[H1870]]

###### 29
When [[H3588]] men are brought low [[H8213]] and you say, [[H559]] ‘Lift them up,’ [[H1466]] then He will save [[H3467]] the lowly. [[H7807]]

###### 30
He will deliver [even] [[H4422]] the guilty [[H336]] one, [[H5355]] who will be rescued [[H4422]] through the purity [[H1252]] of your hands.” [[H3709]]
