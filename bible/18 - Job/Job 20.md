### 1
Then Zophar [[H6691]] the Naamathite [[H5284]] replied: [[H6030]]

### 2
“For this reason [[H3651]] my anxious thoughts [[H5587]] compel me to answer, [[H7725]] because [[H5668]] of the turmoil [[H2363]] within me. 

### 3
I have heard [[H8085]] a rebuke [[H4148]] that insults me, [[H3639]] and my understanding [[H998]] makes me reply. [[H6030]]

### 4
Do you not know [[H3045]] that from [[H4480]] antiquity, [[H5703]] since [[H4480]] man [[H120]] was placed [[H7760]] on [[H5921]] the earth, [[H776]]

### 5
the triumph [[H7445]] of the wicked [[H7563]] has been brief [[H7138]] and the joy [[H8057]] of the godless [[H2611]] momentary? [[H7281]]

### 6
Though [[H518]] his arrogance [[H7863]] reaches [[H5927]] the heavens, [[H8064]] and his head [[H7218]] touches [[H5060]] the clouds, [[H5645]]

### 7
he will perish [[H6]] forever, [[H5331]] like his own dung; [[H1561]] those who had seen him [[H7200]] will ask, [[H559]] ‘Where is he?’ [[H335]]

### 8
He will fly away [[H5774]] like a dream, [[H2472]] never [[H3808]] to be found; [[H4672]] he will be chased away [[H5074]] like a vision [[H2384]] in the night. [[H3915]]

### 9
The eye [[H5869]] [that] saw him [[H7805]] will see him no [[H3808]] more, [[H3254]] and his place [[H4725]] will no [[H3808]] longer [[H5750]] behold him. [[H7789]]

### 10
His sons [[H1121]] will seek the favor [[H7521]] of the poor, [[H1800]] for his own hands [[H3027]] must return [[H7725]] his wealth. [[H202]]

### 11
The youthful vigor [[H5934]] that fills [[H4390]] his bones [[H6106]] will lie down [[H7901]] with [[H5973]] him in [[H5921]] the dust. [[H6083]]

### 12
Though [[H518]] evil [[H7451]] is sweet [[H4985]] in his mouth [[H6310]] and he conceals [[H3582]] it under [[H8478]] his tongue, [[H3956]]

### 13
though he cannot bear [[H2550]] to let it go [[H5800]] and keeps [[H4513]] it in [[H8432]] his mouth, [[H2441]]

### 14
yet his food [[H3899]] will sour [[H2015]] in his stomach [[H4578]] to the venom [[H4846]] of cobras [[H6620]] within him. [[H7130]]

### 15
He swallows [[H1104]] wealth [[H2428]] but vomits it out; [[H6958]] God [[H410]] will force it [[H3423]] from his stomach. [[H990]]

### 16
He will suck [[H3243]] the poison [[H7219]] of cobras; [[H6620]] the fangs [[H3956]] of a viper [[H660]] will kill him. [[H2026]]

### 17
He will not [[H408]] enjoy [[H7200]] the streams, [[H6390]] the rivers [[H5104]] flowing with [[H5158]] honey [[H1706]] and cream. [[H2529]]

### 18
He must return [[H7725]] the fruit of his labor [[H3022]] without [[H3808]] consuming it; [[H1104]] he cannot [[H3808]] enjoy [[H5965]] the profits [[H2428]] of his trading. [[H8545]]

### 19
For [[H3588]] he has oppressed [[H7533]] [and] forsaken [[H5800]] the poor; [[H1800]] he has seized [[H1497]] houses [[H1004]] he did not [[H3808]] build. [[H1129]]

### 20
Because [[H3588]] his appetite [[H990]] is never [[H3808]] satisfied, [[H3045]] he cannot [[H3808]] escape [[H4422]] with his treasure. [[H2530]]

### 21
Nothing [[H369]] is left [[H8300]] for him to consume; [[H400]] therefore, [[H5921]] his prosperity [[H2898]] will not [[H3808]] endure. [[H2342]]

### 22
In the midst [[H4390]] of his plenty, [[H5607]] he will be distressed; [[H3334]] the full [[H3605]] force [[H3027]] of misery [[H6001]] will come upon him. [[H935]]

### 23
When he [[H1961]] has filled [[H4390]] his stomach, [[H990]] God will vent [[H7971]] His fury [[H2740]] upon him,  raining it down [[H4305]] on him [[H5921]] as he eats. [[H3894]]

### 24
Though he flees [[H1272]] from an iron [[H1270]] weapon, [[H5402]] a bronze-tipped [[H5154]] arrow [[H7198]] will pierce him. [[H2498]]

### 25
It is drawn [[H8025]] out of [[H3318]] his back, [[H1465]] the gleaming point [[H1300]] out of his liver. [[H4846]] Terrors [[H367]] come [[H1980]] over him. [[H5921]]

### 26
Total [[H3605]] darkness [[H2822]] is reserved [[H2934]] for his treasures. [[H6845]] A fire [[H784]] unfanned [[H3808]] will consume him [[H398]] and devour what is left [[H8300]] in his tent. [[H168]]

### 27
The heavens [[H8064]] will expose [[H1540]] his iniquity, [[H5771]] and the earth [[H776]] will rise up [[H6965]] against him. 

### 28
The possessions [[H2981]] of his house [[H1004]] will be removed, [[H1540]] flowing away [[H5064]] on the day [[H3117]] of God’s wrath. [[H639]]

### 29
This [[H2088]] is the wicked [[H7563]] man’s [[H120]] portion [[H2506]] from God, [[H430]] the inheritance [[H5159]] God [[H410]] has appointed him.” [[H561]]
