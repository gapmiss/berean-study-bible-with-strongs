###### 1
Can you pull in [[H4900]] Leviathan [[H3882]] with a hook [[H2443]] or tie down his tongue [[H3956]] with a rope? [[H2256]]

###### 2
Can you put [[H7760]] a cord [[H100]] through his nose [[H639]] or pierce [[H5344]] his jaw [[H3895]] with a hook? [[H2336]]

###### 3
Will he beg [[H7235]] you [[H413]] for mercy [[H8469]] or [[H518]] speak [[H1696]] to you [[H413]] softly? [[H7390]]

###### 4
Will he make [[H3772]] a covenant [[H1285]] with you [[H5973]] to take him [[H3947]] as a slave [[H5650]] for life? [[H5769]]

###### 5
Can you pet him [[H7832]] like a bird [[H6833]] or put him on a leash [[H7194]] for your maidens? [[H5291]]

###### 6
Will traders [[H2271]] barter [[H3738]] for him [[H5921]] or divide him [[H2673]] among [[H996]] the merchants? [[H3669]]

###### 7
Can you fill [[H4390]] his hide [[H5785]] with harpoons [[H7905]] or his head [[H7218]] with fishing [[H1709]] spears? [[H6767]]

###### 8
If you lay [[H7760]] a hand [[H3709]] on him, [[H5921]] you will remember [[H2142]] the battle [[H4421]] and never [[H408]] repeat it! [[H3254]]

###### 9
Surely [[H2005]] hope of [overcoming] him [[H8431]] is false. [[H3576]] Is not [[H1571]] the sight of him [[H4758]] overwhelming? [[H2904]]

###### 10
No one [[H3808]] is ferocious [[H393]] enough to [[H3588]] rouse Leviathan. [[H5782]] Then who [[H4310]] is able to stand [[H3320]] against Me? [[H6440]]

###### 11
Who [[H4310]] has given to Me [[H6923]] that I should repay him? [[H7999]] Everything [[H3605]] under [[H8478]] heaven [[H8064]] is [[H1931]] Mine. 

###### 12
I cannot [[H3808]] keep silent [[H2790]] about his limbs, [[H905]] his power [[H1369]] and his graceful [[H2433]] form. [[H6187]]

###### 13
Who [[H4310]] can strip off [[H1540]] his outer [[H6440]] coat? [[H3830]] Who [[H4310]] can approach [him] [[H935]] with a bridle? [[H3718]]

###### 14
Who [[H4310]] can open [[H6605]] his jaws, [[H1817]] ringed [[H5439]] by his fearsome [[H367]] teeth? [[H8127]]

###### 15
[His] rows [[H650]] of scales are [[H4043]] [his] pride, [[H1346]] tightly [[H5462]] sealed together. [[H2368]]

###### 16
One scale [[H259]] is so near [[H5066]] to another [[H259]] that no [[H3808]] air [[H7307]] can pass [[H935]] between them. [[H996]]

###### 17
They are joined [[H1692]] to one [[H376]] another; [[H251]] they clasp [[H3920]] and cannot [[H3808]] be separated. [[H6504]]

###### 18
His snorting [[H5846]] flashes [[H1984]] with light, [[H216]] and his eyes [[H5869]] are like the rays [[H6079]] of dawn. [[H7837]]

###### 19
Firebrands [[H3940]] stream [[H1980]] from his mouth; [[H6310]] fiery [[H784]] sparks [[H3590]] shoot forth! [[H4422]]

###### 20
Smoke [[H6227]] billows [[H3318]] from his nostrils [[H5156]] as from a boiling [[H5301]] pot [[H1731]] over burning reeds. [[H100]]

###### 21
His breath [[H5315]] sets coals [[H1513]] ablaze, [[H3857]] and flames [[H3851]] pour out [[H3318]] of his mouth. [[H6310]]

###### 22
Strength [[H5797]] resides [[H3885]] in his neck, [[H6677]] and dismay [[H1670]] leaps [[H1750]] before him. [[H6440]]

###### 23
The folds [[H4651]] of his flesh [[H1320]] are tightly joined; [[H1692]] they are firm [[H3332]] and immovable. [[H1077]]

###### 24
His chest [[H3820]] is as hard [[H3332]] as [[H3644]] a rock, [[H68]] as hard [[H3332]] as a lower [[H8482]] millstone! [[H6400]]

###### 25
When Leviathan rises up, [[H7613]] the mighty [[H410]] are terrified; [[H1481]] they withdraw [[H2398]] before his thrashing. [[H7667]]

###### 26
The sword [[H2719]] that reaches him [[H5381]] has no [[H1097]] effect, [[H6965]] nor does the spear [[H2595]] or dart [[H4551]] or arrow. [[H8302]]

###### 27
He regards [[H2803]] iron [[H1270]] as straw [[H8401]] and bronze [[H5154]] as rotten [[H7539]] wood. [[H6086]]

###### 28
No [[H3808]] arrow [[H7198]] can make him flee; [[H1272]] slingstones [[H68]] become [[H2015]] like chaff [[H7179]] to him. 

###### 29
A club [[H8455]] is regarded [[H2803]] as straw, [[H7179]] and he laughs [[H7832]] at the sound [[H7494]] of the lance. [[H3591]]

###### 30
His undersides [[H8478]] are jagged [[H2303]] potsherds, [[H2789]] spreading out [[H7502]] the mud [[H2916]] like a threshing sledge. [[H2742]]

###### 31
He makes the depths [[H4688]] seethe [[H7570]] like a cauldron; [[H5518]] he makes [[H7760]] the sea [[H3220]] like a jar of ointment. [[H4841]]

###### 32
He leaves a glistening [[H215]] wake [[H5410]] behind him; [[H310]] one would think [[H2803]] the deep [[H8415]] had white hair! [[H7872]]

###### 33
Nothing [[H369]] on [[H5921]] earth [[H6083]] is his equal— [[H4915]] a creature [[H6213]] devoid of [[H1097]] fear! [[H2844]]

###### 34
He looks down [[H7200]] on all [[H3605]] the haughty; [[H1364]] he [[H1931]] is king [[H4428]] over [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] the proud.” [[H1121]]
