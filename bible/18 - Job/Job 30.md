[[Job 29|←]] • [[Job 31|→]]

---

### 1
But now [[H6258]] they mock me, [[H7832]] men younger [[H6810]] than I am, [[H4480]] whose [[H834]] fathers [[H1]] I would have refused [[H3988]] to put [[H7896]] with [[H5973]] my sheep [[H6629]] dogs. [[H3611]]

### 2
Indeed, [[H1571]] what use [[H4100]] to me  was the strength [[H3581]] of their hands, [[H3027]] since their vigor [[H3624]] had left them? [[H6]]

### 3
Gaunt [[H1565]] from poverty [[H2639]] and hunger, [[H3720]] they gnawed [[H6207]] the dry land, [[H6723]] and the desolate [[H7722]] wasteland [[H4875]] by night. [[H570]]

### 4
They plucked [[H6998]] mallow [[H4408]] among [[H5921]] the shrubs, [[H7880]] and the roots [[H8328]] of the broom tree [[H7574]] were their food. [[H3899]]

### 5
They were banished [[H1644]] from [[H4480]] among [men], [[H1460]] shouted [[H7321]] down [[H5921]] like thieves, [[H1590]]

### 6
so that they lived [[H7931]] on the slopes [[H6178]] of the wadis, [[H5158]] among the rocks [[H3710]] and in holes [[H2356]] in the ground. [[H6083]]

### 7
They cried out [[H5101]] among [[H996]] the shrubs [[H7880]] and huddled [[H5596]] beneath [[H8478]] the nettles. [[H2738]]

### 8
A senseless [[H5036]] and [[H1571]] nameless [[H8034]] brood, [[H1121]] they were driven [[H5217]] off [[H4480]] the land. [[H776]]

### 9
And now [[H6258]] they mock me in song; [[H5058]] I have become [[H1961]] a byword [[H4405]] among them. [[H1992]]

### 10
They abhor me [[H8581]] and keep far [[H7368]] from me; [[H4480]] they do not [[H3808]] hesitate [[H2820]] to spit [[H7536]] in my face. [[H6440]]

### 11
Because [[H3588]] God has unstrung [[H6605]] my bow [[H3499]] and afflicted me, [[H6031]] they have cast off [[H7971]] restraint [[H7448]] in my presence. [[H6440]]

### 12
The rabble [[H6526]] arises [[H6965]] at [[H5921]] my right; [[H3225]] they lay snares [[H7971]] for my feet [[H7272]] and build [[H5549]] siege ramps [[H734]] against me. [[H5921]]

### 13
They tear up [[H5420]] my path; [[H5410]] they profit [[H3276]] from my destruction, [[H1942]] with no one [[H3808]] to restrain them. [[H5826]]

### 14
They advance [[H857]] as through a gaping [[H7342]] breach; [[H6556]] through [[H8478]] the ruins [[H7722]] they keep rolling in. [[H1556]]

### 15
Terrors [[H1091]] are turned loose [[H2015]] against me; [[H5921]] they drive away [[H7291]] my dignity [[H5082]] as by the wind, [[H7307]] and my prosperity [[H3444]] has passed [[H5674]] like a cloud. [[H5645]]

### 16
And now [[H6258]] my soul [[H5315]] is poured out [[H8210]] within me; [[H5921]] days [[H3117]] of suffering [[H6040]] grip me. [[H270]]

### 17
Night [[H3915]] pierces [[H5365]] my bones, [[H6106]] and my gnawing pains [[H6207]] never [[H3808]] rest. [[H7901]]

### 18
By great [[H7227]] power [[H3581]] He becomes like [[H2664]] my garment; [[H3830]] He seizes me [[H247]] by the collar [[H6310]] of my tunic. [[H3801]]

### 19
He throws [[H3384]] me into the mud, [[H2563]] and I have become [[H4911]] like dust [[H6083]] and ashes. [[H665]]

### 20
I cry out to You [[H413]] for help, [[H7768]] but You do not [[H3808]] answer; [[H6030]] when I stand up, [[H5975]] You merely look at me. [[H995]]

### 21
You have ruthlessly turned [[H2015]] on me;  You oppose me [[H7852]] with Your strong [[H6108]] hand. [[H3027]]

### 22
You snatch me up [[H5375]] into [[H413]] the wind [[H7307]] and drive me [before it]; [[H7392]] You toss me about [[H4127]] in the storm. [[H7738]]

### 23
Yes, [[H3588]] I know that [[H3045]] You will bring me down [[H7725]] [to] death, [[H4194]] to the place [[H1004]] appointed [[H4150]] for all [[H3605]] the living. [[H2416]]

### 24
Yet [[H389]] no one [[H3808]] stretches out [[H7971]] his hand [[H3027]] to a ruined man [[H1164]] when [[H518]] he cries for help [[H7769]] in his distress. [[H6365]]

### 25
Have I not [[H3808]] wept [[H1058]] for those in trouble? [[H7186]] Has my soul [[H5315]] not grieved [[H5701]] for the needy? [[H34]]

### 26
But when [[H3588]] I hoped for [[H6960]] good, [[H2896]] evil [[H7451]] came; [[H935]] when I looked [[H3176]] for light, [[H216]] darkness [[H652]] came. [[H935]]

### 27
I am churning [[H7570]] within [[H4578]] and cannot [[H3808]] rest; [[H1826]] days [[H3117]] of affliction [[H6040]] confront me. [[H6923]]

### 28
I go about [[H1980]] blackened, [[H6937]] but not [[H3808]] by the sun. [[H2535]] I stand up [[H6965]] in the assembly [[H6951]] and cry for help. [[H7768]]

### 29
I have become [[H1961]] a brother [[H251]] to jackals, [[H8577]] and a companion [[H7453]] of ostriches. [[H1323]]

### 30
My skin [[H5785]] grows black [[H7835]] and peels, [[H4480]] and my bones [[H6106]] burn [[H2787]] with fever. [[H2721]]

### 31
My harp [[H3658]] is tuned [[H1961]] to mourning [[H60]] and my flute [[H5748]] to the sound [[H6963]] of weeping. [[H1058]]
