[[Job 41|←]] • [[Psalms 1|→]]

### 1
Then Job [[H347]] replied [[H6030]] to the LORD: [[H3068]]

### 2
“I know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] You can do [[H3201]] all things [[H3605]] and that no [[H3808]] plan [[H4209]] of Yours [[H4480]] can be thwarted. [[H1219]]

### 3
You asked, ‘Who [[H4310]] is this [[H2088]] who conceals [[H5956]] My counsel [[H6098]] without [[H1097]] knowledge?’ [[H1847]] Surely [[H3651]] I spoke of things [[H5046]] I did not [[H3808]] understand, [[H995]] things too wonderful [[H6381]] for [[H4480]] me to know. [[H3045]]

### 4
You said, ‘Listen [[H8085]] now, [[H4994]] and I [[H595]] will speak. [[H1696]] I will question you, [[H7592]] and you shall answer Me.’ [[H3045]]

### 5
My ears [[H8085]] had heard of You, [[H8088]] but now [[H6258]] my eyes [[H5869]] have seen You. [[H7200]]

### 6
Therefore [[H5921]] I retract [my words], [[H3988]] and I repent [[H5162]] in [[H5921]] dust [[H6083]] and ashes.” [[H665]]

### 7
After [[H310]] the LORD [[H3068]] had spoken [[H1696]] these [[H428]] words [[H1697]] to [[H413]] Job, [[H347]] He [[H3068]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Eliphaz [[H464]] the Temanite, [[H8489]] “My wrath [[H639]] is kindled [[H2734]] against you  and your two [[H8147]] friends. [[H7453]] For [[H3588]] you have not [[H3808]] spoken [[H1696]] about Me [[H413]] accurately, [[H3559]] as My servant [[H5650]] Job has. [[H347]]

### 8
So now, [[H6258]] take [[H3947]] seven [[H7651]] bulls [[H6499]] and seven [[H7651]] rams, [[H352]] go [[H1980]] to [[H413]] My servant [[H5650]] Job, [[H347]] and sacrifice [[H5927]] a burnt offering [[H5930]] for yourselves. [[H1157]] Then My servant [[H5650]] Job [[H347]] will pray [[H6419]] for you, [[H5921]] for [[H3588]] I will accept [[H5375]] his prayer [[H6440]] and not [[H1115]] deal [[H6213]] with you [[H5973]] [according to your] folly. [[H5039]] For [[H3588]] you have not [[H3808]] spoken [[H1696]] accurately [[H3559]] about Me, [[H413]] as My servant [[H5650]] Job has. [[H347]]

### 9
So Eliphaz [[H464]] the Temanite, [[H8489]] Bildad [[H1085]] the Shuhite, [[H7747]] and Zophar [[H6691]] the Naamathite [[H5284]] went [[H1980]] and did [[H6213]] as [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] had told them; [[H1696]] and the LORD [[H3068]] accepted [[H5375]] Job’s request. [[H347]]

### 10
After Job [[H347]] had prayed [[H6419]] for [[H1157]] his friends, [[H7453]] the LORD [[H3068]] restored [[H7725]] his prosperity [[H7622]] and doubled [[H3254]] his [[H347]] former possessions. [[H3605]]

### 11
All [[H3605]] his brothers [[H251]] and sisters [[H269]] and prior [[H6440]] acquaintances [[H3045]] came [[H935]] and dined [[H398]] with him [[H5973]] in his house. [[H1004]] They consoled [[H5110]] him  and comforted [[H5162]] him [[H853]] over [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] the adversity [[H7451]] that [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] had brought [[H935]] upon him. [[H5921]] And each [[H376]] one gave [[H5414]] him  a [[H259]] piece of silver [[H7192]] and a [[H259]] gold [[H2091]] ring. [[H5141]]

### 12
So the LORD [[H3068]] blessed [[H1288]] Job's [[H347]] latter [days] [[H319]] more than his first. [[H7225]] He owned [[H1961]] 14,000 [[H702]] sheep, [[H6629]] 6,000 [[H8337]] camels, [[H1581]] 1,000 [[H505]] yoke [[H6776]] of oxen, [[H1241]] and 1,000 [[H505]] female donkeys. [[H860]]

### 13
And he also had [[H1961]] seven [[H7658]] sons [[H1121]] and three [[H7969]] daughters. [[H1323]]

### 14
He named [[H7121]] his first [[H259]] daughter Jemimah, [[H3224]] his second [[H8145]] Keziah, [[H7103]] and his third [[H7992]] Keren-happuch. [[H7163]]

### 15
No [[H3808]] women [[H802]] as beautiful [[H3303]] as Job’s [[H347]] daughters [[H1323]] could be found [[H4672]] in all [[H3605]] the land, [[H776]] and their father [[H1]] granted [[H5414]] them [[H1992]] an inheritance [[H5159]] among [[H8432]] their brothers. [[H251]]

### 16
After [[H310]] this, [[H2063]] Job [[H347]] lived [[H2421]] 140 [[H3967]] years [[H8141]] and saw [[H7200]] his children [[H1121]] and their [[H1121]] children [[H1121]] to the fourth [[H702]] generation. [[H1755]]

### 17
And so Job [[H347]] died, [[H4191]] old [[H2205]] and full [[H7649]] of years. [[H3117]]
