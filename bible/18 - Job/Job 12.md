### 1
Then Job [[H347]] answered: [[H6030]]

### 2
“Truly [[H551]] then [[H3588]] you [[H859]] are the people, [[H5971]] and wisdom [[H2451]] will die [[H4191]] with you! [[H5973]]

### 3
But I also [[H1571]] have a mind; [[H3824]] I [[H595]] am not [[H3808]] inferior [[H5307]] to you. [[H4480]] Who [[H4310]] does not [know] [[H369]] such things [[H3644]] as these? [[H428]]

### 4
I am [[H1961]] a laughingstock [[H7814]] to my friends, [[H7453]] though I called [[H7121]] on God, [[H433]] and He answered. [[H6030]] The righteous [[H6662]] and upright man [[H8549]] is a laughingstock. [[H7814]]

### 5
The one at ease [[H7600]] despises [[H937]] misfortune [[H3940]] as the fate [[H6248]] of those whose feet [[H7272]] are slipping. [[H4571]]

### 6
The tents [[H168]] of robbers [[H7703]] are safe, [[H7951]] and those who provoke [[H7264]] God [[H410]] are secure— [[H987]] those who carry [[H935]] their god [[H433]] in their hands. [[H3027]]

### 7
But [[H199]] ask [[H7592]] the animals, [[H929]] and they will instruct you; [[H3384]] ask the birds [[H5775]] of the air, [[H8064]] and they will tell [[H5046]] you. 

### 8
Or [[H176]] speak [[H7878]] to the earth, [[H776]] and it will teach you; [[H3384]] let the fish [[H1709]] of the sea [[H3220]] inform [[H5608]] you. 

### 9
Which [[H4310]] of all [[H3605]] these [[H428]] does not [[H3808]] know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] the hand [[H3027]] of the LORD [[H3069]] has done [[H6213]] this? [[H2063]]

### 10
The life [[H5315]] of every [[H3605]] living thing [[H2416]] is in His hand, [[H3027]] as well as the breath [[H7307]] of all [[H3605]] mankind. [[H1320]]

### 11
Does not [[H3808]] the ear [[H241]] test [[H974]] words [[H4405]] as the tongue [[H2441]] tastes [[H2938]] its  food? [[H400]]

### 12
Wisdom [[H2451]] is found with the elderly, [[H3453]] and understanding [[H8394]] comes with long [[H753]] life. [[H3117]]

### 13
Wisdom [[H2451]] and strength [[H1369]] belong to God; [[H5973]] counsel [[H6098]] and understanding are His. [[H8394]]

### 14
What [[H2005]] He tears down [[H2040]] cannot [[H3808]] be rebuilt; [[H1129]] the man [[H376]] He imprisons [[H5462]] cannot [[H3808]] be released. [[H6605]]

### 15
If [[H2005]] He holds back [[H6113]] the waters, [[H4325]] they dry up, [[H3001]] and if He releases them, [[H7971]] they overwhelm [[H2015]] the land. [[H776]]

### 16
True wisdom [[H8454]] and power [[H5797]] belong to Him. [[H5973]] The deceived [[H7683]] and the deceiver [are His]. [[H7686]]

### 17
He leads counselors [[H3289]] away [[H1980]] barefoot [[H7758]] and makes fools [[H1984]] of judges. [[H8199]]

### 18
He loosens [[H6605]] the bonds [[H4148]] placed by kings [[H4428]] and fastens [[H631]] a belt [[H232]] around their waists. [[H4975]]

### 19
He leads priests [[H3548]] away [[H1980]] barefoot [[H7758]] and overthrows [[H5557]] the established. [[H386]]

### 20
He deprives [[H5493]] the trusted [[H539]] of speech [[H8193]] and takes away [[H3947]] the discernment [[H2940]] of elders. [[H2205]]

### 21
He pours out [[H8210]] contempt [[H937]] on [[H5921]] nobles [[H5081]] and disarms [[H4206]] the mighty. [[H650]]

### 22
He reveals [[H1540]] the deep things [[H6013]] of [[H4480]] darkness [[H2822]] and brings [[H3318]] deep shadows [[H6757]] into light. [[H216]]

### 23
He makes nations [[H1471]] great, [[H7679]] and destroys them; [[H6]] He enlarges [[H7849]] nations, [[H1471]] and sends them away. [[H5148]]

### 24
He deprives [[H5493]] the earth's [[H776]] leaders [[H7218]] of reason, [[H3820]] and makes them wander [[H8582]] a trackless [[H3808]] wasteland. [[H8414]]

### 25
They grope [[H4959]] in darkness [[H2822]] with no [[H3808]] light; [[H216]] He makes them stagger [[H8582]] like drunkards. [[H7910]]
