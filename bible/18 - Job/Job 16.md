### 1
Then Job [[H347]] answered: [[H6030]]

### 2
“I have heard [[H8085]] many [[H7227]] things like these; [[H428]] miserable [[H5999]] comforters [[H5162]] are you all. [[H3605]]

### 3
Is there no end [[H7093]] to your long-winded [[H7307]] speeches? [[H1697]] What [[H4100]] provokes you [[H4834]] to [[H3588]] continue testifying? [[H6030]]

### 4
I [[H595]] could also [[H1571]] speak [[H1696]] like you  if [[H3863]] you [[H5315]] were [[H3426]] in my [[H5315]] place; [[H8478]] I could heap up [[H2266]] words [[H4405]] against you [[H5921]] and shake [[H5128]] my head [[H7218]] at you. [[H5921]]

### 5
But I would encourage you [[H553]] with [[H1119]] my mouth, [[H6310]] and the consolation [[H5205]] of my lips [[H8193]] would bring relief. [[H2820]]

### 6
Even if [[H518]] I speak, [[H1696]] my pain [[H3511]] is not [[H3808]] relieved, [[H2820]] and if I hold back, [[H2308]] how [[H4100]] will it go away? [[H1980]]

### 7
Surely [[H389]] He has now [[H6258]] exhausted me; [[H3811]] You have devastated [[H8074]] all [[H3605]] my family. [[H5712]]

### 8
You have shriveled me up [[H7059]] [as] [[H1961]] a witness [against me]; [[H5707]] my frailty [[H3585]] rises up [[H6965]] and testifies [[H6030]] against me. [[H6440]]

### 9
His anger [[H639]] has torn me [[H2963]] and hated me; [[H7852]] He gnashes [[H2786]] His teeth [[H8127]] at me. [[H5921]] My adversary [[H6862]] pierces [[H3913]] me  with His eyes. [[H5869]]

### 10
They open [[H6473]] their mouths [[H6310]] against me [[H5921]] and strike [[H5221]] my cheeks [[H3895]] with contempt; [[H2781]] they join [[H4390]] together [[H3162]] against me. [[H5921]]

### 11
God [[H410]] has delivered me [[H5462]] to [[H413]] unjust men; [[H5760]] He has thrown me [[H3399]] to [[H5921]] the clutches [[H3027]] of the wicked. [[H7563]]

### 12
I was [[H1961]] at ease, [[H7961]] but He shattered me; [[H6565]] He seized me [[H270]] by the neck [[H6203]] and crushed me. [[H6327]] He has set me up [[H6965]] as His  target; [[H4307]]

### 13
His archers [[H7228]] surround me. [[H5437]] He pierces [[H6398]] my kidneys [[H3629]] without [[H3808]] mercy [[H2550]] and spills [[H8210]] my gall [[H4845]] on the ground. [[H776]]

### 14
He breaks me [[H6555]] with wound [[H6556]] upon wound; [[H6556]] He rushes [[H7323]] me [[H5921]] like a warrior. [[H1368]]

### 15
I have sewn [[H8609]] sackcloth [[H8242]] over [[H5921]] my skin; [[H1539]] I have buried [[H5953]] my horn [[H7161]] in the dust. [[H6083]]

### 16
My face [[H6440]] is red [[H2560]] with [[H4480]] weeping, [[H1065]] and deep shadows [[H6757]] circle [[H5921]] my eyes; [[H6079]]

### 17
yet [[H5921]] my hands [[H3709]] are free of [[H3808]] violence [[H2555]] and my prayer [[H8605]] is pure. [[H2134]]

### 18
O earth, [[H776]] do not [[H408]] cover [[H3680]] my blood; [[H1818]] may my cry for help [[H2201]] never [[H408]] be [[H1961]] laid to rest. [[H4725]]

### 19
Even [[H1571]] now [[H6258]] my witness [[H5707]] is in heaven, [[H8064]] and my advocate [[H7717]] is on high! [[H4791]]

### 20
My friends [[H7453]] are my scoffers [[H3887]] as my eyes [[H5869]] pour out [tears] [[H1811]] to [[H413]] God. [[H433]]

### 21
Oh, that a man [[H1397]] might plead [[H3198]] with [[H5973]] God [[H433]] as [he] [pleads] [[H1121]] with his neighbor! [[H7453]]

### 22
For when [[H3588]] only a few [[H4557]] years [[H8141]] are past [[H857]] I will go [[H1980]] the way [[H734]] of no [[H3808]] return. [[H7725]]
