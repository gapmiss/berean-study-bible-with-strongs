###### 1
Then Bildad [[H1085]] the Shuhite [[H7747]] replied: [[H6030]]

###### 2
“How long [[H575]] until [[H5704]] you end [[H7760]] these speeches? [[H4405]] Show some sense, [[H995]] and then [[H310]] we can talk. [[H1696]]

###### 3
Why [[H4069]] are we regarded [[H2803]] as cattle, [[H929]] as stupid [[H2933]] in your sight? [[H5869]]

###### 4
You who tear [[H2963]] yourself [[H5315]] in anger— [[H639]] should the earth [[H776]] be forsaken [[H5800]] on your account, [[H4616]] or the rocks [[H6697]] be moved [[H6275]] from their place? [[H4725]]

###### 5
Indeed, [[H1571]] the lamp [[H216]] of the wicked [[H7563]] is extinguished; [[H1846]] the flame [[H7632]] of his fire [[H784]] does not [[H3808]] glow. [[H5050]]

###### 6
The light [[H216]] in his tent [[H168]] grows dark, [[H2821]] and the lamp [[H5216]] beside him [[H5921]] goes out. [[H1846]]

###### 7
His vigorous [[H202]] stride [[H6806]] is shortened, [[H3334]] and his own schemes [[H6098]] trip him up. [[H7993]]

###### 8
For [[H3588]] his own feet [[H7272]] lead [[H7971]] him into a net, [[H7568]] and he wanders [[H1980]] into [[H5921]] its mesh. [[H7639]]

###### 9
A trap [[H6341]] seizes [[H270]] his heel; [[H6119]] a snare [[H6782]] grips him. [[H2388]]

###### 10
A noose [[H2256]] is hidden [[H2934]] in the ground, [[H776]] and a trap [[H4434]] lies in [[H5921]] his path. [[H5410]]

###### 11
Terrors [[H1091]] frighten [[H1204]] him on every side [[H5439]] and harass [[H6327]] his every step. [[H7272]]

###### 12
His strength [[H202]] is [[H1961]] depleted, [[H7457]] and calamity [[H343]] [is] ready [[H3559]] at his side. [[H6763]]

###### 13
It devours [[H398]] patches [[H905]] of his skin; [[H5785]] the firstborn [[H1060]] of death [[H4194]] devours [[H398]] his limbs. [[H905]]

###### 14
He is torn [[H5423]] from the shelter [[H4009]] of his tent [[H168]] and is marched off [[H6805]] to the king [[H4428]] of terrors. [[H1091]]

###### 15
Fire [[H1097]] resides [[H7931]] in his tent; [[H168]] brimstone [[H1614]] is scattered [[H2219]] over [[H5921]] his home. [[H5116]]

###### 16
The roots [[H8328]] beneath him [[H8478]] dry up, [[H3001]] and the branches [[H7105]] above him [[H4605]] wither away. [[H5243]]

###### 17
The memory of him [[H2143]] perishes [[H6]] from [[H4480]] the earth, [[H776]] and he has  no [[H3808]] name [[H8034]] in [[H6440]] the land. [[H2351]]

###### 18
He is driven [[H1920]] from light [[H216]] into [[H413]] darkness [[H2822]] and is chased [[H5074]] from the inhabited world. [[H8398]]

###### 19
He has no [[H3808]] offspring [[H5209]] or posterity [[H5220]] among his people, [[H5971]] no [[H369]] survivor [[H8300]] where he once lived. [[H4033]]

###### 20
Those in the west [[H314]] are appalled [[H8074]] at [[H5921]] his fate, [[H3117]] while those in the east [[H6931]] tremble in horror. [[H8178]]

###### 21
Surely [[H389]] such [[H428]] is the dwelling [[H4908]] of the wicked, [[H5767]] and this [[H2088]] is the place [[H4725]] of one who does not [[H3808]] know [[H3045]] God.” [[H410]]
