[[Job 4|←]] • [[Job 6|→]]

---

### 1
Call out [[H7121]] if you please, [[H4994]] but who will answer? [[H6030]] To [[H413]] which [[H4310]] of the holy ones [[H6918]] will you turn? [[H6437]]

### 2
For [[H3588]] resentment [[H3708]] kills [[H2026]] a fool, [[H191]] and envy [[H7068]] slays [[H4191]] the simple. [[H6601]]

### 3
I [[H589]] have seen [[H7200]] a fool [[H191]] taking root, [[H8327]] but suddenly [[H6597]] his house [[H5116]] was cursed. [[H5344]]

### 4
His sons [[H1121]] are far [[H7368]] from safety, [[H3468]] crushed [[H1792]] in court [[H8179]] without [[H369]] a defender. [[H5337]]

### 5
The hungry [[H7456]] consume [[H398]] his harvest, [[H7105]] taking it even [[H3947]] from the thorns; [[H6791]] and the thirsty [[H6782]] pant [[H7602]] after his wealth. [[H2428]]

### 6
For [[H3588]] distress [[H205]] does not [[H3808]] spring [[H3318]] from the dust, [[H6083]] and trouble [[H5999]] does not [[H3808]] sprout [[H6779]] from the ground. [[H127]]

### 7
Yet [[H3588]] man [[H120]] is born [[H3205]] to trouble [[H5999]] as surely as sparks [[H1121]] fly [[H5774]] upward. [[H1361]]

### 8
However, [[H199]] if I were you, [[H589]] I would appeal [[H1875]] to [[H413]] God [[H410]] and lay [[H7760]] my cause [[H1700]] before [[H413]] Him [[H430]]

### 9
who does [[H6213]] great [[H1419]] and [[H369]] unsearchable things, [[H2714]] wonders [[H6381]] without [[H369]] number. [[H4557]]

### 10
He gives [[H5414]] rain [[H4306]] to [[H5921]] the earth [[H776]] and sends [[H7971]] water [[H4325]] upon [[H5921]] the fields. [[H2351]]

### 11
He sets [[H7760]] the lowly [[H8217]] on high, [[H4791]] so that mourners [[H6937]] are lifted [[H7682]] to safety. [[H3468]]

### 12
He thwarts [[H6565]] the schemes [[H4284]] of the crafty, [[H6175]] so that their hands [[H3027]] find [[H6213]] no [[H3808]] success. [[H8454]]

### 13
He catches [[H3920]] the wise [[H2450]] in their craftiness, [[H6193]] and sweeps away [[H4116]] the plans [[H6098]] of the cunning. [[H6617]]

### 14
They encounter [[H6298]] darkness [[H2822]] by day [[H3119]] and grope [[H4959]] at noon [[H6672]] as in the night. [[H3915]]

### 15
He saves [[H3467]] the needy [[H34]] from the sword [[H2719]] in their mouth [[H6310]] and from the clutches [[H3027]] of the powerful. [[H2389]]

### 16
So the poor [[H1800]] have [[H1961]] hope, [[H8615]] and injustice [[H5766]] shuts [[H7092]] its mouth. [[H6310]]

### 17
Blessed [[H835]] indeed [[H2009]] is the man [[H582]] [whom] God [[H433]] corrects; [[H3198]] so do not [[H408]] despise [[H3988]] the discipline [[H4148]] of the Almighty. [[H7706]]

### 18
For [[H3588]] He [[H1931]] wounds, [[H3510]] but also binds; [[H2280]] He strikes, [[H4272]] but His hands [[H3027]] also heal. [[H7495]]

### 19
He will rescue [[H5337]] you from six [[H8337]] calamities; [[H6869]] no [[H3808]] harm [[H7451]] will touch [[H5060]] you  in seven. [[H7651]]

### 20
In famine [[H7458]] He will redeem you [[H6299]] from death, [[H4194]] and in battle [[H4421]] from the stroke [[H3027]] of the sword. [[H2719]]

### 21
You will be hidden [[H2244]] from the scourge [[H7752]] of the tongue, [[H3956]] and need not [[H3808]] fear [[H3372]] destruction [[H7701]] when [[H3588]] it comes. [[H935]]

### 22
You will laugh [[H7832]] at destruction [[H7701]] and famine, [[H3720]] and need not [[H408]] fear [[H3372]] the beasts [[H2416]] of the earth. [[H776]]

### 23
For [[H3588]] you will have a covenant [[H1285]] with [[H5973]] the stones [[H68]] of the field, [[H7704]] and the wild [[H7704]] animals [[H2416]] will be at peace [[H7999]] with you. 

### 24
You will know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] your tent [[H168]] is secure, [[H7965]] and find nothing [[H3808]] amiss [[H2398]] when inspecting [[H6485]] your home. [[H5116]]

### 25
You will know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] your offspring [[H2233]] will be many, [[H7227]] and your descendants [[H6631]] [will be] like the grass [[H6212]] of the earth. [[H776]]

### 26
You will come [[H935]] to the grave [[H6913]] in full vigor, [[H3624]] like a sheaf of grain [[H1430]] gathered [[H5927]] in season. [[H6256]]

### 27
Indeed, [[H2009]] we have investigated, [[H2713]] and it [[H1931]] is true! [[H3651]] So hear it [[H8085]] and [[H859]] know [[H3045]] for yourself.”
