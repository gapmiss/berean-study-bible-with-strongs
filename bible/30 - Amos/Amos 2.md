[[Amos 1|←]] • [[Amos 3|→]]

###### 1
This is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] says: [[H559]] “For [[H5921]] three [[H7969]] transgressions [[H6588]] of Moab, [[H4124]] even [[H5921]] four, [[H702]] I will not [[H3808]] revoke [My judgment], [[H7725]] because [[H5921]] he burned [[H8313]] the bones [[H6106]] of the king [[H4428]] of Edom [[H123]] to lime. [[H7875]]

###### 2
So I will send [[H7971]] fire [[H784]] against Moab [[H4124]] to consume [[H398]] the citadels [[H759]] of Kerioth. [[H7152]] Moab [[H4124]] will die [[H4191]] in tumult, [[H7588]] amid war cries [[H8643]] and the blast [[H6963]] of the trumpet. [[H7782]]

###### 3
I will cut off [[H3772]] the ruler [[H8199]] from its midst [[H7130]] and kill [[H2026]] all [[H3605]] the officials [[H8269]] with him,” [[H5973]] says [[H559]] the LORD. [[H3068]]

###### 4
This is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3069]] says: [[H559]] “For [[H5921]] three [[H7969]] transgressions [[H6588]] of Judah, [[H3063]] even [[H5921]] four, [[H702]] I will not [[H3808]] revoke [My judgment], [[H7725]] because [[H5921]] they have rejected [[H3988]] the law [[H8451]] of the LORD [[H3069]] and have not [[H3808]] kept [[H8104]] His statutes; [[H2706]] they have been led astray [[H8582]] by the lies [[H3577]] in which [[H834]] their forefathers [[H1]] walked. [[H1980]]

###### 5
So I will send [[H7971]] fire [[H784]] upon Judah [[H3063]] to consume [[H398]] the citadels [[H759]] of Jerusalem.” [[H3389]]

###### 6
This is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] says: [[H559]] “For [[H5921]] three [[H7969]] transgressions [[H6588]] of Israel, [[H3478]] even [[H5921]] four, [[H702]] I will not [[H3808]] revoke [My judgment], [[H7725]] because [[H5921]] they sell [[H4376]] the righteous [[H6662]] for silver [[H3701]] and the needy [[H34]] for [[H5668]] a pair of sandals. [[H5275]]

###### 7
They trample [[H7602]] on the heads [[H7218]] of the poor [[H1800]] as on [[H5921]] the dust [[H6083]] of the earth; [[H776]] they push [[H5186]] the needy [[H6035]] out of their way. [[H1870]] A man [[H376]] and his father [[H1]] resort [[H1980]] to the same girl [[H5291]] and so [[H4616]] profane [[H2490]] My holy [[H6944]] name. [[H8034]]

###### 8
They lie down [[H5186]] beside [[H681]] every [[H3605]] altar [[H4196]] on [[H5921]] garments [[H899]] taken in pledge, [[H2254]] and in the house [[H1004]] of their God, [[H430]] they drink [[H8354]] the wine [[H3196]] of the sanctioned. [[H6064]]

###### 9
Yet [it was] I [[H595]] who destroyed [[H8045]] the Amorite [[H567]] before them, [[H6440]] though [[H834]] his height [[H1363]] was like that of [[H1363]] the cedars, [[H730]] and he was [[H1931]] as strong [[H2634]] as the oaks; [[H437]] yet I destroyed [[H8045]] his fruit [[H6529]] above [[H4605]] and his roots [[H8328]] below. [[H8478]]

###### 10
And I [[H595]] brought [[H5927]] you up [[H853]] from the land [[H776]] of Egypt [[H4714]] and led [[H1980]] you [[H853]] forty [[H705]] years [[H8141]] in the wilderness, [[H4057]] that you might take possession [[H3423]] of the land [[H776]] of the Amorite. [[H567]]

###### 11
I raised up [[H6965]] prophets [[H5030]] from your sons [[H1121]] and Nazirites [[H5139]] from your young men. [[H970]] Is this [[H2063]] not [[H369]] true, [[H637]] O children [[H1121]] of Israel?” [[H3478]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD. [[H3068]]

###### 12
“But you made the Nazirites [[H5139]] drink [[H8248]] wine [[H3196]] and commanded [[H6680]] the prophets [[H5030]] not [[H3808]] to prophesy. [[H5012]]

###### 13
Behold, [[H2009]] I [[H595]] am about to crush you [[H5781]] in your place [[H8478]] as [[H834]] a wagonload [[H5699]] of  sheaves [[H5995]] crushes grain. [[H5781]]

###### 14
Escape [[H4498]] will fail [[H6]] the swift, [[H7031]] the strong [[H2389]] will not [[H3808]] prevail [[H553]] by his strength, [[H3581]] and the mighty [[H1368]] will not [[H3808]] save [[H4422]] his life. [[H5315]]

###### 15
The archer [[H8610]] will not [[H3808]] stand his ground, [[H5975]] the fleet [[H7031]] of foot [[H7272]] will not [[H3808]] escape, [[H4422]] and the horseman [[H7392]] will not [[H3808]] save [[H4422]] his life. [[H5315]]

###### 16
Even the bravest [[H533]] of mighty [[H1368]] men [[H3820]] will flee [[H5127]] naked [[H6174]] on that [[H1931]] day,” [[H3117]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD. [[H3068]]
