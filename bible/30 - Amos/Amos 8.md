###### 1
This is what [[H3541]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD [[H3069]] showed me: [[H7200]] I saw [[H2009]] a basket [[H3619]] of summer fruit. [[H7019]]

###### 2
“Amos, [[H5986]] what [[H4100]] do you [[H859]] see?” [[H7200]] He asked. [[H559]] “A basket [[H3619]] of summer fruit,” [[H7019]] I replied. [[H559]] So the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H559]] to me, [[H413]] “The end [[H7093]] has come [[H935]] for [[H413]] My people [[H5971]] Israel; [[H3478]] I will no [[H3808]] longer [[H3254]] spare [[H5674]] them.” 

###### 3
“In that [[H1931]] day,” [[H3117]] declares [[H5002]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD, [[H3068]] “the songs [[H7892]] of the temple [[H1964]] will turn to wailing. [[H3213]] Many [[H7227]] [will be] the corpses, [[H6297]] strewn [[H7993]] in silence [[H2013]] everywhere!” [[H3605]]

###### 4
Hear [[H8085]] this, [[H2063]] you who trample [[H7602]] on the needy, [[H34]] who do away with [[H7673]] the poor [[H6035]] of the land, [[H6041]]

###### 5
asking, [[H559]] “When [[H4970]] will the New Moon [[H2320]] be over [[H5674]] that we may sell [[H7666]] grain? [[H7668]] When will the Sabbath [end], [[H7676]] that we may market [[H6605]] wheat? [[H1250]] Let us reduce [[H6994]] the ephah [[H374]] and increase [[H1431]] the shekel; [[H8255]] let us cheat [[H5791]] with dishonest [[H4820]] scales. [[H3976]]

###### 6
Let us buy [[H7069]] the poor [[H1800]] with silver [[H3701]] and the needy [[H34]] for [[H5668]] a pair of sandals, [[H5275]] selling [[H7666]] even the chaff [[H4651]] with the wheat!” [[H1250]]

###### 7
The LORD [[H3068]] has sworn [[H7650]] by the Pride [[H1347]] of Jacob: [[H3290]] “I will never [[H518]] forget [[H7911]] any [[H3605]] of their deeds. [[H4639]]

###### 8
Will not [[H3808]] the land [[H776]] quake [[H7264]] for [[H5921]] this [[H2063]] and all [[H3605]] its dwellers [[H3427]] mourn? [[H56]] All of it [[H3605]] will swell [[H5927]] like the Nile; [[H2975]] it will surge [[H1644]] and then subside [[H8257]] like the Nile [[H2975]] in Egypt.” [[H4714]]

###### 9
“And in that [[H1931]] day,” [[H3117]] declares [[H5002]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD, [[H3069]] “I will make the sun [[H8121]] go down [[H935]] at noon; [[H6672]] and I will darken [[H2821]] the earth [[H776]] in the daytime. [[H3117]]

###### 10
I will turn [[H2015]] your feasts [[H2282]] into mourning [[H60]] and all [[H3605]] your songs [[H7892]] into lamentation. [[H7015]] I will cause everyone [[H3605]] to wear [[H5927]] sackcloth [[H8242]] and every [[H3605]] head [[H7218]] to be shaved. [[H7144]] I will make it like [[H7760]] a time of mourning [[H60]] for an only son, [[H3173]] and its outcome [[H319]] like a bitter [[H4751]] day. [[H3117]]

###### 11
Behold! [[H2009]] The days [[H3117]] are coming,” [[H935]] declares [[H5002]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD, [[H3069]] “when I will send [[H7971]] a famine [[H7458]] on the land— [[H776]] not [[H3808]] a famine [[H7458]] of bread [[H3899]] or a thirst [[H6772]] for water, [[H4325]] but [a famine] [[H3588]] of hearing [[H8085]] the words [[H1697]] of the LORD. [[H3068]]

###### 12
People will stagger [[H5128]] from sea [[H3220]] to [[H5704]] sea [[H3220]] and roam [[H7751]] from north [[H6828]] to [[H5704]] east, [[H4217]] seeking [[H1245]] the word [[H1697]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] but they will not [[H3808]] find it. [[H4672]]

###### 13
In that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] the lovely [[H3303]] young women, [[H1330]] the young men as well, [[H970]] will faint [[H5968]] from thirst. [[H6772]]

###### 14
Those who swear [[H7650]] by the guilt [[H819]] of Samaria [[H8111]] and say, [[H559]] ‘As surely as your god [[H430]] lives, [[H2416]] O Dan,’ [[H1835]] or, ‘As surely as the Way [[H1870]] of Beersheba [[H884]] lives’— [[H2416]] they will fall, [[H5307]] never [[H3808]] to rise [[H6965]] again.” [[H5750]]
