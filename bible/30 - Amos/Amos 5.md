### 1
Hear [[H8085]] this [[H2088]] word, [[H1697]] O house [[H1004]] of Israel, [[H3478]] this [[H834]] lamentation [[H7015]] I [[H595]] take up [[H5375]] against you: [[H5921]]

### 2
“Fallen is [[H5307]] Virgin [[H1330]] Israel, [[H3478]] never [[H3808]] to rise [[H6965]] again. [[H3254]] She lies abandoned [[H5203]] on [[H5921]] her land, [[H127]] with no [[H369]] one to raise her up.” [[H6965]]

### 3
This is what [[H3588]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD [[H3069]] says: [[H559]] “The city [[H5892]] that marches out [[H3318]] a thousand strong [[H505]] will only see a hundred [[H3967]] return, [[H7604]] and the one that marches out [[H3318]] a hundred strong [[H3967]] will have but ten [[H6235]] left [[H7604]] in the house [[H1004]] of Israel.” [[H3478]]

### 4
For [[H3588]] this is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] says [[H559]] to the house [[H1004]] of Israel: [[H3478]] “Seek [[H1875]] Me and live! [[H2421]]

### 5
Do not [[H408]] seek [[H1875]] Bethel [[H1008]] or go [[H935]] to Gilgal; [[H1537]] do not [[H3808]] journey [[H5674]] to Beersheba, [[H884]] for [[H3588]] Gilgal [[H1537]] will surely [[H1540]] go into exile, [[H1540]] and  Bethel [[H1008]] will come [[H1961]] to nothing. [[H205]]

### 6
Seek [[H1875]] the LORD [[H3069]] and live, [[H2421]] or [[H6435]] He will spread [[H6743]] like fire [[H784]] through the house [[H1004]] of Joseph; [[H3130]] it will devour everything, [[H398]] with no [[H369]] one at Bethel [[H1008]] to extinguish it. [[H3518]]

### 7
You who turn [[H2015]] justice [[H4941]] into wormwood [[H3939]] and cast [[H3240]] righteousness [[H6666]] to the ground— [[H776]]

### 8
He who made [[H6213]] the Pleiades [[H3598]] and Orion, [[H3685]] who turns [[H2015]] darkness [[H6757]] into dawn [[H1242]] and darkens [[H2821]] day [[H3117]] into night, [[H3915]] who summons [[H7121]] the waters [[H4325]] of the sea [[H3220]] and pours them [[H8210]] over [[H5921]] the face [[H6440]] of the earth, [[H776]] the LORD [[H3068]] is His name. [[H8034]]

### 9
He flashes [[H1082]] destruction [[H7701]] on [[H5921]] the strong, [[H5794]] so that fury [[H7701]] comes [[H935]] upon [[H5921]] the stronghold— [[H4013]]

### 10
you hate [[H8130]] the one who reproves [[H3198]] in the gate [[H8179]] and despise [[H8581]] him who speaks [[H1696]] with integrity. [[H8549]]

### 11
Therefore, [[H3651]] because [[H3282]] you trample [[H1318]] on [[H5921]] the poor [[H1800]] and exact [[H3947]] from him [[H4480]] a tax [[H4864]] of grain, [[H1250]] you will never [[H3808]] live [[H3427]] in the stone houses [[H1004]] you have built; [[H1129]] you will never [[H3808]] drink [[H8354]] the wine [[H3196]] from the lush [[H2531]] vineyards [[H3754]] you have planted. [[H5193]]

### 12
For [[H3588]] I know [[H3045]] your transgressions [[H6588]] are many [[H7227]] and your sins [[H2403]] are innumerable. [[H6099]] You oppress [[H6887]] the righteous, [[H6662]] taking [[H3947]] bribes, [[H3724]] and depriving the poor [[H34]] of justice [[H5186]] at the gates. [[H8179]]

### 13
Therefore, [[H3651]] the prudent [[H7919]] keep silent [[H1826]] in such [[H1931]] times, [[H6256]] for [[H3588]] the days [[H6256]] are evil. [[H7451]]

### 14
Seek [[H1875]] good, [[H2896]] not [[H408]] evil [[H7451]] so that [[H4616]] you may live, [[H2421]] and the LORD, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of Hosts, [[H6635]] will be [[H1961]] with you, [[H854]] as [[H834]] you have claimed. [[H559]]

### 15
Hate [[H8130]] evil [[H7451]] and love [[H157]] good; [[H2896]] establish [[H3322]] justice [[H4941]] in the gate. [[H8179]] Perhaps [[H194]] the LORD, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of Hosts, [[H6635]] will be gracious [[H2603]] to the remnant [[H7611]] of Joseph.” [[H3130]]

### 16
Therefore [[H3651]] this is what [[H3541]] the LORD, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of Hosts, [[H6635]] the Lord, [[H136]] says: [[H559]] “There will be wailing [[H4553]] in all [[H3605]] the public squares [[H7339]] and cries of [[H559]] ‘Alas, [[H1930]] alas’ [[H1930]] in all [[H3605]] the streets. [[H2351]] The farmer [[H406]] will be summoned [[H7121]] to [[H413]] mourn, [[H60]] and the mourners [[H3045]] to [[H413]] wail. [[H4553]]

### 17
There will be wailing [[H4553]] in all [[H3605]] the vineyards, [[H3754]] for [[H3588]] I will pass [[H5674]] through your midst,” [[H7130]] says [[H559]] the LORD. [[H3068]]

### 18
Woe [[H1945]] to you who long for [[H183]] the Day [[H3117]] of the LORD! [[H3068]] What [[H4100]] will the Day [[H3117]] of the LORD [[H3068]] be for you?  It [will be] [[H1931]] darkness [[H2822]] and not [[H3808]] light. [[H216]]

### 19
It will be like [[H834]] a man [[H376]] who flees [[H5127]] from [[H6440]] a lion [[H738]] only to encounter [[H6293]] a bear, [[H1677]] or who enters [[H935]] his house [[H1004]] and rests [[H5564]] his hand [[H3027]] against [[H5921]] the wall, [[H7023]] only to have a serpent [[H5175]] bite him. [[H5391]]

### 20
Will not [[H3808]] the Day [[H3117]] of the LORD [[H3068]] be darkness [[H2822]] and not [[H3808]] light, [[H216]] even gloom [[H651]] with no [[H3808]] brightness [[H5051]] in it? 

### 21
I hate, [[H8130]] I despise [[H3988]] your feasts! [[H2282]] I cannot [[H3808]] stand the stench [[H7306]] of your solemn assemblies. [[H6116]]

### 22
Even [[H3588]] though [[H518]] you offer [[H5927]] Me  burnt offerings [[H5930]] and grain offerings, [[H4503]] I will not [[H3808]] accept them; [[H7521]] for your peace offerings [[H8002]] of fattened cattle, [[H4806]] I will have no [[H3808]] regard. [[H5027]]

### 23
Take away [[H5493]] from Me [[H5921]] the noise [[H1995]] of your songs! [[H7892]] I will not [[H3808]] listen [[H8085]] to the music [[H2172]] of your harps. [[H5035]]

### 24
But let justice [[H4941]] roll on [[H1556]] like a river, [[H4325]] and righteousness [[H6666]] like an ever-flowing [[H386]] stream. [[H5158]]

### 25
Did you bring [[H5066]] Me  sacrifices [[H2077]] and offerings [[H4503]] forty [[H705]] years [[H8141]] in the wilderness, [[H4057]] O house [[H1004]] of Israel? [[H3478]]

### 26
You have lifted up [[H5375]] Sakkuth [[H5522]] your king [[H4432]] and Kaiwan [[H3594]] your star [[H3556]] god, [[H430]] the idols [[H6754]] you made [[H6213]] for yourselves. 

### 27
Therefore, I will send you into exile [[H1540]] beyond [[H1973]] Damascus,” [[H1834]] says [[H559]] the LORD, [[H3068]] whose name [is] [[H8034]] the God [[H430]] of Hosts. [[H6635]]
