### 1
This is what [[H3541]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD [[H3069]] showed me: [[H7200]] He was preparing [[H3335]] swarms of locusts [[H1462]] just after [[H310]] the king's [[H4428]] harvest, [[H1488]] as the late spring crop [[H5927]] was coming up. [[H8462]]

### 2
And [[H1961]] when [[H518]] the locusts had [[H3615]] eaten [[H398]] every green plant [[H6212]] in the land, [[H776]] I said, [[H559]] “Lord [[H136]] GOD, [[H3068]] please [[H4994]] forgive! [[H5545]] How [[H4310]] will Jacob [[H3290]] survive, [[H6965]] since [[H3588]] he [[H1931]] is so small?” [[H6996]]

### 3
So the LORD [[H3068]] relented [[H5162]] from [[H5921]] this [plan]. [[H2063]] “It will not [[H3808]] happen,” [[H1961]] [He] [[H3068]] said. [[H559]]

### 4
This is what [[H3541]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD [[H3069]] showed me: [[H7200]] The Lord [[H136]] GOD [[H3069]] was calling [[H7121]] for judgment [[H7378]] by fire. [[H784]] It consumed [[H398]] the great [[H7227]] deep [[H8415]] and devoured [[H398]] the land. [[H2506]]

### 5
Then I said, [[H559]] “Lord [[H136]] GOD, [[H3069]] please [[H4994]] stop! [[H2308]] How [[H4310]] will Jacob [[H3290]] survive, [[H6965]] since [[H3588]] he [[H1931]] is so small?” [[H6996]]

### 6
So the LORD [[H3068]] relented [[H5162]] from [[H5921]] this [plan]. [[H2063]] “It [[H1931]] will not [[H3808]] happen [[H1961]] either,” [[H1571]] said [[H559]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD. [[H3069]]

### 7
This is what [[H3541]] He showed me: [[H7200]] Behold, [[H2009]] the Lord [[H136]] was standing [[H5324]] by [[H5921]] a wall [[H2346]] true to plumb, [[H594]] with a plumb line [[H594]] in His hand. [[H3027]]

### 8
“Amos, [[H5986]] what [[H4100]] do you [[H859]] see?” [[H7200]] asked [[H559]] the LORD. [[H3068]] “A plumb line,” [[H594]] I replied. [[H559]] “Behold,” [[H2005]] said [[H559]] the Lord, [[H136]] “I am setting [[H7760]] a plumb line [[H594]] among [[H7130]] My people [[H5971]] Israel; [[H3478]] I will no [[H3808]] longer [[H3254]] spare them: [[H5674]]

### 9
The high places [[H1116]] of Isaac [[H3446]] will be deserted, [[H8074]] and the sanctuaries [[H4720]] of Israel [[H3478]] will be laid waste; [[H2717]] and I will rise up [[H6965]] against [[H5921]] the house [[H1004]] of Jeroboam [[H3379]] with My sword.” [[H2719]]

### 10
Then Amaziah [[H558]] the priest [[H3548]] of Bethel [[H1008]] sent [[H7971]] word to [[H413]] Jeroboam [[H3379]] king [[H4428]] of Israel, [[H3478]] saying, [[H559]] “Amos [[H5986]] has conspired [[H7194]] against you [[H5921]] in the midst [[H7130]] of the house [[H1004]] of Israel. [[H3478]] The land [[H776]] cannot [[H3808]] bear [[H3557]] all [[H3605]] his words, [[H1697]]

### 11
for [[H3588]] this is what [[H3541]] Amos [[H5986]] has said: [[H559]] ‘Jeroboam [[H3379]] will die [[H4191]] by the sword, [[H2719]] and Israel [[H3478]] will surely [[H1540]] go into exile, [[H1540]] away from [[H5921]] her homeland.’” [[H127]]

### 12
And Amaziah [[H558]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Amos, [[H5986]] “Go away, [[H1980]] you seer! [[H2374]] Flee [[H1272]] to [[H413]] the land [[H776]] of Judah; [[H3063]] earn your bread [[H398]] there [[H8033]] and do your prophesying [[H5012]] there, [[H8033]]

### 13
but  never [[H3808]] prophesy [[H5012]] at Bethel [[H1008]] again, [[H3254]] because [[H3588]] it [is] [[H1931]] the sanctuary [[H4720]] of the king [[H4428]] and the temple [[H1004]] of the kingdom.” [[H4467]]

### 14
“I [[H595]] was not [[H3808]] a prophet,” [[H5030]] Amos [[H5986]] replied, [[H6030]] “[nor was I] the son [[H1121]] of a prophet; [[H5030]] rather, [[H3588]] I [[H595]] was a herdsman [[H951]] [and] [[H595]] a tender [[H1103]] of sycamore-fig trees. [[H8256]]

### 15
But the LORD [[H3068]] took me [[H3947]] from following [[H310]] the flock [[H6629]] and said [[H559]] to me, [[H413]] ‘Go, [[H1980]] prophesy [[H5012]] to [[H413]] My people [[H5971]] Israel.’ [[H3478]]

### 16
Now, therefore, [[H6258]] hear [[H8085]] the word [[H1697]] of the LORD. [[H3068]] You [[H859]] say: [[H559]] ‘Do not [[H3808]] prophesy [[H5012]] against [[H5921]] Israel; [[H3478]] do not [[H3808]] preach [[H5197]] against [[H5921]] the house [[H1004]] of Isaac.’ [[H3446]]

### 17
Therefore, [[H3651]] this is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] says: [[H559]] ‘Your wife [[H802]] will become a prostitute [[H2181]] in the city, [[H5892]] and your sons [[H1121]] and daughters [[H1323]] will fall [[H5307]] by the sword. [[H2719]] Your land [[H127]] will be divided [[H2505]] by a measuring line, [[H2256]] and you yourself [[H859]] will die [[H4191]] on [[H5921]] pagan [[H2931]] soil. [[H127]] And Israel [[H3478]] will surely [[H1540]] go into exile, [[H1540]] away from [[H5921]] her homeland. [[H127]]
