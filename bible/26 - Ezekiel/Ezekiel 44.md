### 1
The man then brought me back [[H7725]] to [[H1870]] outer [[H2435]] gate [[H8179]] of the sanctuary [[H4720]] that faced [[H6437]] east, [[H6921]] but it [[H1931]] was shut. [[H5462]]

### 2
And the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H559]] to me, [[H413]] “This [[H2088]] gate [[H8179]] is to remain [[H1961]] shut. [[H5462]] It shall not [[H3808]] be opened, [[H6605]] and no [[H3808]] man [[H376]] shall enter [[H935]] through it,  because [[H3588]] the LORD, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] has entered [[H935]] through it.  Therefore it will remain [[H1961]] shut. [[H5462]]

### 3
Only the prince [[H5387]] himself [[H1931]] may sit [[H3427]] inside the gateway  to eat [[H398]] in the presence of [[H6440]] the LORD. [[H3068]] He must enter [[H935]] by way [[H1870]] of the portico [[H197]] of the gateway [[H8179]] and go out [[H3318]] the same way.” [[H1870]]

### 4
Then the man brought me [[H935]] to [[H413]] the front [[H6440]] of the temple [[H1004]] by way [[H1870]] of the north [[H6828]] gate. [[H8179]] I looked [[H7200]] and saw [[H2009]] the glory [[H3519]] of the LORD [[H3068]] filling [[H4390]] His [[H3068]] temple, [[H1004]] and I fell [[H5307]] facedown. [[H413]]

### 5
The LORD [[H3068]] said [[H559]] to me: [[H413]] “Son [[H1121]] of man, [[H120]] pay attention; [[H7760]] look carefully [[H7200]] with your eyes [[H5869]] and listen closely [[H8085]] with your ears [[H241]] to everything [[H3605]] I [[H589]] tell [[H1696]] you [[H853]] concerning all [[H3605]] the statutes [[H2708]] and laws [[H8451]] of the house [[H1004]] of the LORD. [[H3068]] Take careful note [[H7760]] of the entrance [[H3996]] of the temple, [[H1004]] along with all [[H3605]] the exits [[H4161]] of the sanctuary. [[H4720]]

### 6
Tell [[H559]] the rebellious [[H4805]] house [[H1004]] of Israel [[H3478]] that this is what [[H3541]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD [[H3069]] says: [[H559]] ‘I have had enough [[H7227]] of all [[H3605]] your abominations, [[H8441]] O house [[H1004]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

### 7
In addition [[H413]] to all [[H3605]] your other abominations, [[H8441]] you brought in [[H935]] foreigners, [[H1121]] uncircumcised [[H6189]] in both heart [[H3820]] and flesh, [[H1320]] to occupy [[H1961]] My sanctuary; [[H4720]] you defiled [[H2490]] My temple [[H1004]] when you offered [[H7126]] My food— [[H3899]] the fat [[H2459]] and the blood; [[H1818]] you broke [[H6565]] My covenant. [[H1285]]

### 8
And you have not [[H3808]] kept [[H8104]] charge [[H4931]] of My holy things, [[H6944]] but have appointed [[H7760]] others to keep [[H8104]] charge [[H4931]] of My sanctuary [[H4720]] for you.’ 

### 9
This is what [[H3541]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD [[H3068]] says: [[H559]] ‘No [[H3605]] foreigner [[H1121]] uncircumcised [[H6189]] in heart [[H3820]] and flesh [[H1320]] may enter [[H935]] My sanctuary— [[H4720]] not even a foreigner [[H1121]] who [[H834]] lives among [[H8432]] the Israelites. [[H1121]]

### 10
Surely [[H3588]] the Levites [[H3881]] who [[H834]] wandered away [[H7368]] from Me [[H5921]] when Israel [[H3478]] went astray, [[H8582]] and who [[H834]] wandered [[H8582]] away from Me [[H5921]] after [[H310]] their idols, [[H1544]] will bear the consequences [[H5375]] of their iniquity. [[H5771]]

### 11
Yet they shall be [[H1961]] ministers [[H8334]] in My sanctuary, [[H4720]] [having] charge [[H6486]] of [[H413]] the gates [[H8179]] of the temple [[H1004]] and ministering [[H8334]] [there]. [[H1004]] They [[H1992]] shall slaughter [[H7819]] the burnt offerings [[H5930]] and other sacrifices [[H2077]] for the people [[H5971]] and stand [[H5975]] before them [[H6440]] to minister to them. [[H8334]]

### 12
Because [[H3282]] they ministered [[H8334]] before [[H6440]] their idols [[H1544]] and became [[H1961]] a stumbling block [[H4383]] of iniquity [[H5771]] to the house [[H1004]] of Israel, [[H3478]] therefore [[H5921]] I swore with an uplifted [[H5375]] hand [[H3027]] concerning them [[H5921]] that they would bear the consequences [[H5375]] of their iniquity, [[H5771]] declares [[H5002]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD. [[H3069]]

### 13
They must not [[H3808]] approach [[H5066]] Me [[H413]] to serve Me as priests [[H3547]] or come near [[H5066]] any [[H3605]] of My holy things [[H6944]] or the most holy things. [[H6944]] They will bear [[H5375]] the shame [[H3639]] of the abominations [[H8441]] they have committed. [[H6213]]

### 14
Yet I will appoint [[H5414]] them [[H853]] to keep [[H8104]] charge [[H4931]] of all [[H3605]] the work [[H5656]] for the temple [[H1004]] and everything [[H3605]] to be done [[H6213]] in it. 

### 15
But the Levitical [[H3881]] priests, [[H3548]] who are descended [[H1121]] from Zadok [[H6659]] and who [[H834]] kept [[H8104]] charge [[H4931]] of My sanctuary [[H4720]] when the Israelites [[H1121]] went astray [[H8582]] from Me, [[H5921]] are to approach [[H7126]] Me [[H413]] to minister before Me. [[H8334]] They will stand [[H5975]] before Me [[H6440]] to offer [[H7126]] Me  fat [[H2459]] and blood, [[H1818]] declares [[H5002]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD. [[H3069]]

### 16
They alone [[H1992]] shall enter [[H935]] My sanctuary [[H4720]] and draw near [[H7126]] to [[H413]] My table [[H7979]] to minister before Me. [[H8334]] They will keep [[H8104]] My charge. [[H4931]]

### 17
When they enter [[H935]] the gates [[H8179]] of the inner [[H6442]] court, [[H2691]] they are to wear [[H3847]] linen [[H6593]] garments; [[H899]] they must not [[H3808]] wear [[H5927]] anything made of wool [[H6785]] when they minister [[H8334]] at the gates [[H8179]] of the inner [[H6442]] court [[H2691]] or inside [the temple]. [[H1004]]

### 18
They are to wear linen [[H6593]] turbans [[H6287]] on [[H5921]] their heads [[H7218]] and linen [[H6593]] undergarments [[H4370]] around [[H5921]] their waists. [[H4975]] They must not [[H3808]] wear [[H2296]] anything that makes them perspire. [[H3154]]

### 19
When they go out [[H3318]] to [[H413]] the outer [[H2435]] court, [[H2691]] to [[H413]] the people, [[H5971]] they are to take off [[H6584]] the garments [[H899]] in which [[H834]] they have ministered, [[H8334]] leave [[H3240]] them [[H853]] in the holy [[H6944]] chambers, [[H3957]] and dress [[H3847]] in other [[H312]] clothes [[H899]] so that they do not [[H3808]] transmit holiness [[H6942]] to the people [[H5971]] with their garments. [[H899]]

### 20
They must not [[H3808]] shave [[H1548]] their heads [[H7218]] or let their hair [[H6545]] grow long, [[H7971]] but must carefully trim [[H3697]] their hair. [[H7218]]

### 21
No [[H3808]] priest [[H3548]] may drink [[H8354]] wine [[H3196]] before he enters [[H935]] the inner [[H6442]] court. [[H2691]]

### 22
And they shall not [[H3808]] marry [[H3947]] a widow [[H490]] or a divorced woman, [[H1644]] but must marry [[H3947]] a virgin [[H1330]] of the descendants [[H2233]] of the house [[H1004]] of Israel, [[H3478]] or a widow [[H490]] of a priest. [[H3548]]

### 23
They are to teach [[H3384]] My people [[H5971]] the difference between [[H996]] the holy [[H6944]] and the common, [[H2455]] and show them how to discern [[H3045]] between [[H996]] the clean [[H2889]] and the unclean. [[H2931]]

### 24
In [[H5921]] any dispute, [[H7379]] they [[H1992]] shall officiate [[H5975]] as judges [[H8199]] [and] judge [[H8199]] according to My ordinances. [[H4941]] They must observe [[H8104]] My laws [[H8451]] and statutes [[H2708]] regarding all [[H3605]] My appointed feasts, [[H4150]] and they must keep My Sabbaths [[H7676]] holy. [[H6942]]

### 25
A priest must not [[H3808]] defile himself [[H2930]] by going [[H935]] near [[H413]] a dead [[H4191]] person. [[H120]] However, [[H3588]] for a father, [[H1]] a mother, [[H517]] a son, [[H1121]] a daughter, [[H1323]] a brother, [[H251]] or an unmarried [[H3808]] sister, [[H269]] he may do so, [[H2930]]

### 26
and after [[H310]] he is cleansed, [[H2893]] he must count [[H5608]] off seven [[H7651]] days [[H3117]] for himself. 

### 27
And on the day [[H3117]] he goes [[H935]] into [[H413]] the sanctuary, [[H6944]] into [[H413]] the inner [[H6442]] court, [[H2691]] to minister [[H8334]] in the sanctuary, [[H6944]] he must present [[H7126]] his sin offering, [[H2403]] declares [[H5002]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD. [[H3069]]

### 28
In regard to [[H1961]] their inheritance, [[H5159]] I am [[H589]] their inheritance. [[H5159]] You are to give [[H5414]] them  no [[H3808]] possession [[H272]] in Israel, [[H3478]] for I [am] [[H589]] their possession. [[H272]]

### 29
They [[H1992]] shall eat [[H398]] the grain offerings, [[H4503]] the sin offerings, [[H2403]] and the guilt offerings. [[H817]] Everything [[H3605]] in Israel [[H3478]] devoted [[H2764]] to the LORD [[H1961]] will belong to them. 

### 30
The best [[H7225]] of all [[H3605]] the firstfruits [[H1061]] and of every [[H3605]] contribution [[H8641]] from all [[H3605]] your offerings [[H8641]] will belong to [[H1961]] the priests. [[H3548]] You are to give [[H5414]] your first [[H7225]] batch of dough [[H6182]] to the priest, [[H3548]] so that a blessing [[H1293]] may rest [[H5117]] upon [[H413]] your homes. [[H1004]]

### 31
The priests [[H3548]] may not [[H3808]] eat [[H398]] any [[H3605]] bird [[H5775]] or animal [[H929]] found dead [[H5038]] or torn [by] [wild] [beasts]. [[H2966]]
