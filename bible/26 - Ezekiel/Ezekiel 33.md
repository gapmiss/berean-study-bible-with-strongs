###### 1
Again the word [[H1697]] of the LORD [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] to me, [[H413]] saying, [[H559]]

###### 2
“Son [[H1121]] of man, [[H120]] speak [[H1696]] to [[H413]] your people [[H1121]] and tell [[H559]] them: [[H413]] ‘Suppose [[H3588]] I bring [[H935]] the sword [[H2719]] against [[H5921]] a land, [[H776]] and the people [[H5971]] of that land [[H776]] choose [[H3947]] a [[H259]] man [[H376]] from among them, [[H7097]] appointing [[H5414]] him [[H853]] as their  watchman, [[H6822]]

###### 3
and he sees [[H7200]] the sword [[H2719]] coming [[H935]] against [[H5921]] that land [[H776]] and blows [[H8628]] his trumpet [[H7782]] to warn [[H2094]] the people. [[H5971]]

###### 4
Then if anyone hears [[H8085]] the sound [[H6963]] of the trumpet [[H7782]] but fails [[H3808]] to heed the warning, [[H2094]] and the sword [[H2719]] comes [[H935]] and takes him away, [[H3947]] his blood [[H1818]] will be [[H1961]] on his own head. [[H7218]]

###### 5
Since he heard [[H8085]] the sound [[H6963]] of the trumpet [[H7782]] but failed [[H3808]] to heed the warning, [[H2094]] his blood [[H1818]] will be [[H1961]] on his own head.  If he [[H1931]] had taken warning, [[H2094]] he would have saved [[H4422]] his life. [[H5315]]

###### 6
But if [[H3588]] the watchman [[H6822]] sees [[H7200]] the sword [[H2719]] coming [[H935]] and fails [[H3808]] to blow [[H8628]] the trumpet, [[H7782]] so that the people [[H5971]] are not [[H3808]] warned, [[H2094]] and the sword [[H2719]] comes [[H935]] and takes away [[H3947]] a life, [[H5315]] then that one [[H1931]] is taken away [[H3947]] in his iniquity, [[H5771]] but I will hold the watchman [[H6822]] accountable [[H1875]] for his blood. [[H1818]]

###### 7
As for you, [[H859]] O son [[H1121]] of man, [[H120]] I have made [[H5414]] you a watchman [[H6822]] for the house [[H1004]] of Israel; [[H3478]] so hear [[H8085]] the word [[H1697]] from [[H4480]] My mouth [[H6310]] and give them warning [[H2094]] from Me. [[H853]]

###### 8
If I say [[H559]] to the wicked, [[H7563]] ‘O wicked [man], [[H7563]] you will surely die,’ [[H4191]] but you do not [[H3808]] speak out [[H1696]] to dissuade [[H2094]] him [[H7563]] from his way, [[H1870]] then that [[H1931]] wicked [man] [[H7563]] will die [[H4191]] in his iniquity, [[H5771]] yet I will hold you accountable for [[H3027]] his blood. [[H1818]]

###### 9
But if [[H3588]] you [[H859]] warn [[H2094]] the wicked man [[H7563]] to turn [[H7725]] from his way, [[H1870]] and he does not [[H3808]] turn [[H7725]] from it, [[H1870]] he [[H1931]] will die [[H4191]] in his iniquity, [[H5771]] but you [[H859]] will have saved [[H5337]] your life. [[H5315]]

###### 10
Now as for you, [[H859]] son [[H1121]] of man, [[H120]] tell [[H559]] the house [[H1004]] of Israel [[H3478]] that this is what [[H3651]] [they] have said: [[H559]] ‘Our transgressions [[H6588]] and our sins [[H2403]] are heavy [[H5921]] upon us,  and we [[H587]] are wasting away because of them! [[H4743]] How [[H349]] can we live?’ [[H2421]]

###### 11
Say [[H559]] to them: [[H413]] ‘As surely as I [[H589]] live, [[H2416]] declares [[H5002]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD, [[H3069]] I take no [[H518]] pleasure [[H2654]] in the death [[H4194]] of the wicked, [[H7563]] but rather [[H3588]] that the wicked [[H7563]] should turn [[H7725]] from their ways [[H1870]] and live. [[H2421]] Turn! [[H7725]] Turn [[H7725]] from your evil [[H7451]] ways! [[H1870]] For why [[H4100]] should you die, [[H4191]] O house [[H1004]] of Israel? [[H3478]]

###### 12
Therefore, [[H859]] son [[H1121]] of man, [[H120]] say [[H559]] to [[H413]] your people: [[H1121]] ‘The righteousness [[H6666]] of the righteous man [[H6662]] will not [[H3808]] deliver him [[H5337]] in the day [[H3117]] of his transgression; [[H6588]] neither [[H3808]] will the wickedness [[H7564]] of the wicked man [[H7563]] cause him to stumble [[H3782]] on the day [[H3117]] he turns [[H7725]] from his wickedness. [[H7562]] Nor will [[H3808]] the righteous man [[H6662]] be able [[H3201]] to survive [[H2421]] by his righteousness  on the day [[H3117]] he sins. [[H2398]]

###### 13
If I tell [[H559]] the righteous man [[H6662]] that he will surely live, [[H2421]] but he then [[H1931]] trusts [[H982]] in [[H5921]] his righteousness [[H6666]] and commits [[H6213]] iniquity, [[H5766]] then none [[H3605]] of his righteous works [[H6666]] will be remembered; [[H2142]] he will die [[H4191]] because of the iniquity [[H5766]] he has committed. [[H6213]]

###### 14
So when I tell [[H559]] the wicked man, [[H7563]] ‘You will surely die,’ [[H4191]] and he turns [[H7725]] from his sin [[H2403]] and does [[H6213]] what is just [[H4941]] and right— [[H6666]]

###### 15
if he [[H7563]] restores [[H7725]] a pledge, [[H2258]] makes restitution [[H7999]] for what he has stolen, [[H1500]] and walks [[H1980]] in the statutes [[H2708]] of life [[H2416]] without [[H1115]] practicing [[H6213]] iniquity— [[H5766]] he will surely live; [[H2421]] he will not [[H3808]] die. [[H4191]]

###### 16
None [[H3605]] of the sins [[H2403]] he has committed [[H2398]] will be held [[H2142]] against him.  He has done [[H6213]] what is just [[H4941]] and right; [[H6666]] he will surely live. [[H2421]]

###### 17
Yet your people [[H1121]] say, [[H559]] ‘The way [[H1870]] of the LORD [[H136]] is not [[H3808]] just.’ [[H8505]] But it is [[H1992]] their way [[H1870]] that is not [[H3808]] just. [[H8505]]

###### 18
If a righteous man [[H6662]] turns [[H7725]] from his righteousness [[H6666]] and commits [[H6213]] iniquity, [[H5766]] he will die [[H4191]] for it. 

###### 19
But if a wicked man [[H7563]] turns [[H7725]] from his wickedness [[H7564]] and does [[H6213]] what is just [[H4941]] and right, [[H6666]] he [[H1931]] will live [[H2421]] because of this. [[H5921]]

###### 20
Yet you say, [[H559]] ‘The way [[H1870]] of the LORD [[H136]] is not [[H3808]] just.’ [[H8505]] But I will judge [[H8199]] each [[H376]] of you [[H853]] according to his ways, [[H1870]] O house [[H1004]] of Israel.” [[H3478]]

###### 21
In the twelfth [[H8147]] year [[H8141]] of our exile, [[H1546]] on the fifth day [[H2568]] of the tenth month, [[H6224]] a fugitive [[H6412]] from Jerusalem [[H3389]] came [[H935]] to me [[H413]] and reported, [[H559]] “The city [[H5892]] has been taken!” [[H5221]]

###### 22
Now the evening [[H6153]] before [[H6440]] the fugitive [[H6412]] arrived, [[H935]] the hand [[H3027]] of the LORD [[H3068]] was [[H1961]] upon me, [[H413]] and He opened [[H6605]] my mouth [[H6310]] before [[H5704]] the man came [[H935]] to [[H413]] me in the morning. [[H1242]] So my mouth [[H6310]] was opened [[H6605]] and I was no [[H3808]] longer [[H5750]] mute. [[H481]]

###### 23
Then the word [[H1697]] of the LORD [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] to me, [[H413]] saying, [[H559]]

###### 24
“Son [[H1121]] of man, [[H120]] those living [[H3427]] in the [[H428]] ruins [[H2723]] in [[H5921]] the land [[H127]] of Israel [[H3478]] are saying, [[H559]] ‘Abraham [[H85]] was [[H1961]] only one man, [[H259]] yet he possessed [[H3423]] the land. [[H776]] But we [[H587]] are many; [[H7227]] [surely] the land [[H776]] has been given [[H5414]] to us  as a possession.’ [[H4181]]

###### 25
Therefore [[H3651]] tell [[H559]] them [[H413]] that this is what [[H3541]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD [[H3068]] says: [[H559]] ‘You eat [[H398]] meat with the blood [in it], [[H1818]] lift up [[H5375]] your eyes [[H5869]] to [[H413]] your idols, [[H1544]] and shed [[H8210]] blood. [[H1818]] Should you then possess [[H3423]] the land? [[H776]]

###### 26
You have relied [[H5975]] on [[H5921]] your swords, [[H2719]] you have committed [[H6213]] detestable acts, [[H8441]] and each [[H376]] of you has defiled [[H2930]] his neighbor’s [[H7453]] wife. [[H802]] Should you then possess [[H3423]] the land?’ [[H776]]

###### 27
Tell [[H559]] them [[H413]] that this [[H3541]] is what [[H3541]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD [[H3069]] says: [[H559]] ‘As surely as I [[H589]] live, [[H2416]] those [[H834]] in the ruins [[H2723]] will fall [[H5307]] by the sword, [[H2719]] those [[H834]] in [[H5921]] the open field [[H6440]] I will give [[H5414]] to be devoured [[H398]] by wild animals, [[H2416]] and those [[H834]] in the strongholds [[H4686]] and caves [[H4631]] will die [[H4191]] by plague. [[H1698]]

###### 28
I will make [[H5414]] the land [[H776]] a desolate [[H8077]] waste, [[H4923]] and the pride [[H1347]] of her strength [[H5797]] will come to an end. [[H7673]] The mountains [[H2022]] of Israel [[H3478]] will become desolate, [[H8074]] so that no one [[H369]] will pass through. [[H5674]]

###### 29
Then they will know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I [[H589]] am the LORD, [[H3068]] when I have made [[H5414]] the land [[H776]] a desolate [[H8077]] waste [[H4923]] because of [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] the abominations [[H8441]] they have committed.’ [[H6213]]

###### 30
As for you, [[H859]] son [[H1121]] of man, [[H120]] your people [[H1121]] are talking [[H1696]] about you near [[H681]] the city walls [[H7023]] and in the doorways [[H6607]] of their houses. [[H1004]] One [[H2297]] speaks [[H1696]] to [[H854]] another, [[H259]] each [[H376]] saying [[H559]] to his brother, [[H251]] ‘Come [[H935]] and hear [[H8085]] the message [[H1697]] that has come [[H3318]] from [[H853]] the LORD! [[H3068]]

###### 31
So My people [[H5971]] come [[H935]] to you [[H413]] as usual, [[H3996]] sit [[H3427]] before you, [[H6440]] and hear [[H8085]] your words; [[H1697]] but they do not [[H3808]] put them into practice. [[H6213]] Although [[H3588]] they [[H1992]] express [[H6213]] love [[H5690]] with their mouths, [[H6310]] their hearts [[H3820]] pursue [[H1980]] dishonest gain. [[H1215]]

###### 32
Indeed, you [are] [[H2005]] to them  like a singer of love [[H5690]] songs [[H7892]] with a beautiful [[H3303]] voice, [[H6963]] who skillfully [[H2895]] plays an instrument. [[H5059]] They hear [[H8085]] your words [[H1697]] but do not [[H369]] put them into practice. [[H6213]]

###### 33
So when it comes to pass— [[H935]] and surely [[H2009]] it will come— [[H935]] then they will know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] a prophet [[H5030]] has been [[H1961]] among them.” [[H8432]]
