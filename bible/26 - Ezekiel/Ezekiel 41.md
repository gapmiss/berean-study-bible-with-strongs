###### 1
Next he brought [[H935]] me into [[H413]] the outer sanctuary [[H1964]] and measured [[H4058]] the side pillars [[H352]] [to be] six [[H8337]] cubits [[H520]] wide [[H7341]] on each side. [[H6311]]

###### 2
The width [[H7341]] of the entrance [[H6607]] [was] ten [[H6235]] cubits, [[H520]] and the sides [[H3802]] of the entrance [[H6607]] [were] five [[H2568]] cubits [[H520]] on each [[H6311]] side. [[H6311]] He also measured [[H4058]] the length [of the outer sanctuary] [[H753]] [to be] forty [[H705]] cubits, [[H520]] and the width [[H7341]] twenty [[H6242]] cubits. [[H520]]

###### 3
Then he went [[H935]] into [the inner sanctuary] [[H6441]] and measured [[H4058]] the side pillars [[H352]] at the entrance [[H6607]] [to be] two [[H8147]] cubits [wide]. [[H520]] The entrance [[H6607]] [was] six [[H8337]] cubits [wide], [[H520]] [and the walls on each side] [[H6607]] [were] seven [[H7651]] cubits [[H520]] wide. [[H7341]]

###### 4
Then he measured [[H4058]] the room adjacent to [[H413]] the inner sanctuary [[H1964]] [to be] twenty [[H6242]] cubits [[H520]] long [[H753]] [and] twenty [[H6242]] cubits [[H520]] wide. [[H7341]] And he said [[H559]] to me, [[H413]] “This [[H2088]] is the Most Holy Place.” [[H6944]]

###### 5
Next he measured [[H4058]] the wall [[H7023]] of the temple [[H1004]] [to be] six [[H8337]] cubits [thick], [[H520]] and the width [[H7341]] of each [[H5439]] side room [[H6763]] around [[H5439]] the temple [[H1004]] [was] four [[H702]] cubits. [[H520]]

###### 6
The side rooms [[H6763]] were arranged one [[H6763]] above [[H413]] another [[H6763]] in three levels [[H7969]] of thirty rooms each. [[H7970]] There were ledges [[H935]] all around [[H5439]] the wall [[H7023]] of the temple [[H1004]] to serve as [[H1961]] supports [[H270]] for the side rooms, [[H6763]] so that the supports [[H270]] would not [[H3808]] be [fastened] into [[H1961]] the wall [[H7023]] of the temple itself. [[H1004]]

###### 7
The side rooms [[H6763]] surrounding [[H4141]] the temple [[H1004]] widened at each successive level, [[H7337]] because the structure surrounding the temple [[H5439]] ascended by stages [[H1004]] corresponding to [[H5921]] the narrowing of the temple wall [[H7341]] as it rose upward. [[H4605]] And so [[H3651]] a stairway went up [[H5927]] from the lowest [[H8481]] story [[H5921]] to the highest [[H5945]] through the middle one. [[H8484]]

###### 8
I saw [[H7200]] that the temple [[H1004]] had a raised base [[H1363]] all it [[H5439]] around [[H5439]] forming the foundation [[H3245]] for the side rooms. [[H6763]] It was the full length of [[H4393]] a rod, [[H7070]] six [[H8337]] long [[H679]] cubits. [[H520]]

###### 9
The outer [[H2351]] wall [[H7023]] of the side rooms [[H6763]] [was] five [[H2568]] cubits [[H520]] thick, [[H7341]] and [[H834]] the open area [[H3240]] between [[H1004]] the side rooms [[H6763]] of the temple [[H1004]]

###### 10
and the outer chambers [[H3957]] [was] twenty [[H6242]] cubits [[H520]] wide [[H7341]] all around [[H5439]] the temple. [[H1004]]

###### 11
The side rooms [[H6763]] opened into this area, [[H3240]] with one [[H259]] entrance [[H6607]] on [[H1870]] the north [[H6828]] and another [[H259]] on the south. [[H1864]] The open area [[H4725]] [was] five [[H2568]] cubits [[H520]] wide [[H7341]] all around. [[H5439]]

###### 12
Now the building [[H1146]] that [[H834]] faced [[H413]] the temple courtyard [[H1508]] on [[H1870]] the west [[H3220]] [was] seventy [[H7657]] cubits [[H520]] wide, [[H7341]] and the wall [[H7023]] of the building [[H1146]] [was] five [[H2568]] cubits [[H520]] thick [[H7341]] all [[H5439]] around [[H5439]] and a length [[H753]] of ninety [[H8673]] cubits. [[H520]]

###### 13
Then the man measured [[H4058]] the temple [[H1004]] [to be] a hundred [[H3967]] cubits [[H520]] long, [[H753]] and the temple courtyard [[H1508]] and the building [[H1140]] with its walls [[H7023]] [were] also a hundred [[H3967]] cubits [[H520]] long. [[H753]]

###### 14
The width [[H7341]] of the temple courtyard [[H1508]] on the east, [[H6921]] including the front [[H6440]] of the temple, [[H1004]] [was] a hundred [[H3967]] cubits. [[H520]]

###### 15
Next he measured [[H4058]] the length [[H753]] of the building [[H1146]] facing [[H413]] the temple courtyard [[H1508]] at [[H5921]] the rear [of the temple], [[H310]] including its galleries [[H862]] on each side; [[H6311]] it was a hundred [[H3967]] cubits. [[H520]] The outer sanctuary, [[H1964]] the inner sanctuary, [[H6442]] and the porticoes [[H197]] facing the court, [[H2691]]

###### 16
as well as the thresholds [[H5592]] and the beveled [[H331]] windows [[H2474]] and the balconies [[H862]] all around [[H5439]] with their three [[H7969]] levels opposite [[H5048]] the threshold, [[H5592]] were overlaid with [[H7824]] wood [[H6086]] on all sides. [[H5439]] They were paneled from the ground [[H776]] to [[H5704]] the windows, [[H2474]] and the windows [[H2474]] were covered. [[H3680]]

###### 17
In the space above [[H5921]] the outside of the entrance [[H6607]] to [[H5704]] the inner [[H6442]] sanctuary [[H1004]] on the all the [[H2351]] walls, [[H7023]] spaced evenly [[H4060]] around [[H5439]] the inner and [[H6442]] outer sanctuary, [[H2435]]

###### 18
were alternating [[H8561]] carved [[H6213]] cherubim [[H3742]] and palm trees. [[H8561]] Each cherub [[H3742]] had two [[H8147]] faces: [[H6440]]

###### 19
the face [[H6440]] of a man [[H120]] [was] toward [[H413]] the palm tree [[H8561]] on one side, [[H6311]] and the face [[H6440]] of a young lion [[H3715]] [was] toward [[H413]] the palm tree [[H8561]] on the other side. [[H6311]] They were carved [[H6213]] all the way around [[H413]] the temple. [[H1004]]

###### 20
Cherubim [[H3742]] and palm trees [[H8561]] were carved [[H6213]] on the wall [[H7023]] of the outer sanctuary [[H1964]] from the floor [[H776]] to [[H5704]] the space above [[H5921]] the entrance. [[H6607]]

###### 21
The outer sanctuary [[H1964]] had a rectangular [[H7251]] doorframe, [[H4201]] and the [doorframe] [[H6440]] of the sanctuary [[H6944]] was similar. [[H4758]]

###### 22
There was an altar [[H4196]] of wood [[H6086]] three [[H7969]] cubits [[H520]] high [[H1364]] and two [[H8147]] cubits [[H520]] square. [[H753]] It had corners, [[H4740]] a base, [[H753]] and sides [[H7023]] of wood. [[H6086]] And the man told me, [[H1696]] “This [[H2088]] is the table [[H7979]] that [[H834]] is before [[H6440]] the LORD.” [[H3069]]

###### 23
Both the outer sanctuary [[H1964]] and the sanctuary [[H6944]] had double [[H8147]] doors, [[H1817]]

###### 24
and each [[H8147]] door [[H1817]] had two [[H8147]] swinging [[H4142]] panels. [[H1817]] There were two [[H8147]] panels [[H1817]] for one [[H259]] door [[H1817]] and two [[H8147]] for the other. [[H312]]

###### 25
Cherubim [[H3742]] and palm trees [[H8561]] like those [[H834]] on the walls [[H7023]] were carved [[H6213]] on [[H413]] the doors [[H1817]] of the outer sanctuary, [[H1964]] and there was a wooden [[H6086]] canopy [[H5646]] outside, [[H2351]] on [[H413]] the front [[H6440]] of the portico. [[H197]]

###### 26
There were beveled [[H331]] windows [[H2474]] and palm trees [[H8561]] on the side walls [[H3802]] of the portico. [[H197]] The side rooms [[H6763]] of the temple [[H1004]] also had canopies. [[H5646]]
