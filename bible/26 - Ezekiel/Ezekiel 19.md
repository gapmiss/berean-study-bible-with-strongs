###### 1
As for you, [[H859]] take up [[H5375]] a lament [[H7015]] for [[H413]] the princes [[H5387]] of Israel [[H3478]]

###### 2
and say: [[H559]] ‘What [[H4100]] was your mother? [[H517]] A lioness [[H3833]] among [[H996]] the lions! [[H738]] She lay down [[H7257]] among [[H8432]] the young lions; [[H3715]] she reared [[H7235]] her cubs. [[H1482]]

###### 3
She brought up [[H5927]] one [[H259]] of her cubs, [[H1482]] and he became [[H1961]] a young lion. [[H3715]] After learning [[H3925]] to tear [[H2963]] [his] prey, [[H2964]] he devoured [[H398]] men. [[H120]]

###### 4
When the nations [[H1471]] heard [[H8085]] of him, [[H413]] he was trapped [[H8610]] in their pit. [[H7845]] With hooks [[H2397]] they led him away [[H935]] to [[H413]] the land [[H776]] of Egypt. [[H4714]]

###### 5
When she saw [[H7200]] that [[H3588]] she had waited in vain, [[H3176]] that her hope [[H8615]] was lost, [[H6]] she took [[H3947]] another [[H259]] of her cubs [[H1482]] and made [[H7760]] him a young lion. [[H3715]]

###### 6
He prowled [[H1980]] among [[H8432]] the lions, [[H738]] and became [[H1961]] a young lion. [[H3715]] After learning [[H3925]] to tear [[H2963]] [his] prey, [[H2964]] he devoured [[H398]] men. [[H120]]

###### 7
He broke down [[H3045]] their strongholds [[H490]] and devastated [[H2717]] their cities. [[H5892]] The land [[H776]] and all who were in it [[H4393]] shuddered [[H3456]] at the sound [[H6963]] of his roaring. [[H7581]]

###### 8
Then the nations [[H1471]] set out [[H5414]] against him [[H5921]] from the provinces [[H4082]] on every side. [[H5439]] They spread [[H6566]] their net [[H7568]] over him; [[H5921]] he was trapped [[H8610]] in their pit. [[H7845]]

###### 9
With hooks [[H2397]] they caged him [[H5414]] and brought him [[H935]] to [[H413]] the king [[H4428]] of Babylon. [[H894]] They brought him [[H935]] into captivity [[H4686]] so that [[H4616]] his roar [[H6963]] was heard [[H8085]] no [[H3808]] longer [[H5750]] on [[H413]] the mountains [[H2022]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

###### 10
Your mother [[H517]] was like a vine [[H1612]] in your vineyard, [[H1818]] planted [[H8362]] by [[H5921]] the water; [[H4325]] it was fruitful [[H6509]] and full of branches [[H6058]] because of the abundant [[H7227]] waters. [[H4325]]

###### 11
It had [[H1961]] strong [[H5797]] branches, [[H4294]] fit for [[H413]] a ruler's [[H4910]] scepter. [[H7626]] It towered [[H1361]] high [[H6967]] above [[H5921]] the thick branches, [[H5688]] conspicuous [[H7200]] for its height [[H1363]] and for its dense [[H7230]] foliage. [[H1808]]

###### 12
But it was uprooted [[H5428]] in fury, [[H2534]] cast down [[H7993]] to the ground, [[H776]] and the east [[H6921]] wind [[H7307]] dried up [[H3001]] its fruit. [[H6529]] Its strong [[H5797]] branches [[H4294]] were stripped off [[H6561]] and they withered; [[H3001]] the fire [[H784]] consumed them. [[H398]]

###### 13
Now [[H6258]] it is planted [[H8362]] in the wilderness, [[H4057]] in a dry [[H6723]] and thirsty [[H6772]] land. [[H776]]

###### 14
Fire [[H784]] has gone out [[H3318]] from its main branch [[H4294]] and devoured [[H398]] its fruit, [[H6529]] and no [[H3808]] strong [[H5797]] branch [[H4294]] that remains [[H1961]] is fit for a ruler's [[H4910]] scepter.’ [[H7626]] This [[H1931]] is a lament [[H7015]] and shall be used [[H1961]] as a lament.” [[H7015]]
