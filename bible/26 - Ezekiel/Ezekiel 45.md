### 1
When you divide the land [[H776]] by lot [[H5307]] as an inheritance, [[H5159]] you are to set aside [[H7311]] a portion [[H8641]] for the LORD, [[H3068]] a holy [[H6944]] portion of [[H4480]] the land [[H776]] 25,000 [cubits] [[H2568]] long [[H753]] and 20,000 cubits [[H6235]] wide. [[H7341]] This [[H1931]] entire [[H3605]] tract of land [[H1366]] will be holy. [[H6944]]

### 2
Within this area [[H2088]] there is to be [[H1961]] a section for [[H413]] the sanctuary [[H6944]] 500 [cubits] [[H2568]] square, [[H7251]] with 50 [[H2572]] cubits [[H520]] around it [[H5439]] for open land. [[H4054]]

### 3
From [[H4480]] this [[H2063]] holy portion, [[H4060]] you are to measure off [[H4058]] a length [[H753]] of 25,000 [cubits] [[H2568]] and a width [[H7341]] of 10,000 [cubits], [[H6235]] and in it  will be [[H1961]] the sanctuary, [[H4720]] the Most [[H6944]] Holy [Place]. [[H6944]]

### 4
It will be [[H1961]] a holy portion [[H6944]] of [[H4480]] the land [[H776]] to be used by the priests [[H3548]] who minister [[H8334]] in the sanctuary, [[H4720]] who draw near [[H7131]] to minister before [[H8334]] the LORD. [[H3068]] It will be [[H1961]] a place [[H4725]] for their houses, [[H1004]] as well as a holy area [[H4720]] for the sanctuary. [[H4720]]

### 5
[An adjacent area] 25,000 [cubits] [[H2568]] long [[H753]] and 10,000 [cubits] [[H6235]] wide [[H7341]] shall belong [[H1961]] to the Levites [[H3881]] who minister [[H8334]] in the temple; [[H1004]] it will be their possession [[H272]] for towns in which to live. [[H6242]]

### 6
As the property [[H272]] of the city, [[H5892]] you are to set aside [[H5414]] [an area] 5,000 [cubits] [[H2568]] wide [[H7341]] and 25,000 [cubits] [[H2568]] long, [[H753]] adjacent to [[H5980]] the holy [[H6944]] district. [[H8641]] It will belong to [[H1961]] the whole [[H3605]] house [[H1004]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

### 7
And the prince [[H5387]] will have the area [[H2088]] bordering [[H6440]] each side of the area formed by [[H2088]] the holy [[H6944]] district [[H8641]] and the property [[H272]] of the city, [[H5892]] extending westward [[H3220]] from the western [[H3220]] side [[H6285]] and eastward [[H6921]] from the eastern [[H6924]] side, [[H6285]] running lengthwise [[H753]] from the western [[H3220]] boundary [[H1366]] to the eastern [[H6921]] boundary [[H1366]] and parallel to [[H5980]] one [[H259]] of the [tribal] portions. [[H2506]]

### 8
This land [[H776]] will be [[H1961]] his  possession [[H272]] in Israel. [[H3478]] And My princes [[H5387]] will no [[H3808]] longer [[H5750]] oppress [[H3238]] My people, [[H5971]] but will give [[H5414]] the rest of the land [[H776]] to the house [[H1004]] of Israel [[H3478]] according to their tribes. [[H7626]]

### 9
For this is what [[H3541]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD [[H3069]] says: [[H559]] ‘Enough, [[H7227]] O princes [[H5387]] of Israel! [[H3478]] Cease [[H5493]] your violence [[H2555]] and oppression, [[H7701]] and do [[H6213]] what is just [[H4941]] and right. [[H6666]] Stop [[H7311]] dispossessing [[H1646]] My people, [[H5971]] declares [[H5002]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD.’ [[H3069]]

### 10
You must use [[H1961]] honest [[H6664]] scales, [[H3976]] a just [[H6664]] ephah, [[H374]] and a just [[H6664]] bath. [[H1324]]

### 11
The ephah [[H374]] and the bath [[H1324]] shall be [[H1961]] the same [[H259]] quantity [[H8506]] so that the bath [[H1324]] will contain [[H5375]] a tenth [[H4643]] of a homer, [[H2563]] and the ephah [[H374]] a tenth [[H6224]] of a homer; [[H2563]] the homer [[H2563]] will be [[H1961]] the standard measure [for both]. [[H4971]]

### 12
The shekel [[H8255]] will consist of twenty [[H6242]] gerahs. [[H1626]] Twenty [[H6242]] shekels [[H8255]] plus twenty-five [[H6242]] shekels [[H8255]] plus fifteen [[H6235]] shekels [[H8255]] will equal [[H1961]] one mina. [[H4488]]

### 13
This [[H2063]] is the contribution [[H8641]] you are to offer: [[H7311]] a sixth [[H8345]] of an ephah [[H374]] from each homer [[H2563]] of wheat, [[H2406]] and a sixth [[H8341]] of an ephah [[H374]] from each homer [[H2563]] of barley. [[H8184]]

### 14
The prescribed portion [[H2706]] of oil, [[H8081]] measured by the bath, [[H1324]] [is] a tenth [[H4643]] of a bath [[H1324]] from [[H4480]] each cor [[H3734]] (which is ten [[H6235]] baths [[H1324]] [or] one homer; [[H2563]] for [[H3588]] ten [[H6235]] baths [[H1324]] equal one homer). [[H2563]]

### 15
And [[H4480]] one [[H259]] sheep shall be given [[H7716]] from [each] flock [[H6629]] of [[H4480]] two hundred [[H3967]] from the well-watered pastures [[H4945]] of Israel. [[H3478]] These are for the grain offerings, [[H4503]] burnt offerings, [[H5930]] and peace offerings, [[H8002]] to make atonement [[H3722]] for the people, [[H5921]] declares [[H5002]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD. [[H3069]]

### 16
All [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] of the land [[H776]] must participate [[H1961]] in [[H413]] this [[H2063]] contribution [[H8641]] for the prince [[H5387]] in Israel. [[H3478]]

### 17
And [[H5921]] it shall be [[H1961]] the prince's [part] [[H5387]] [to provide] the burnt offerings, [[H5930]] grain offerings, [[H4503]] and drink offerings [[H5262]] for the festivals, [[H2282]] New Moons, [[H2320]] and Sabbaths— [[H7676]] for all [[H3605]] the appointed feasts [[H4150]] of the house [[H1004]] of Israel. [[H3478]] He [[H1931]] will provide [[H6213]] the sin offerings, [[H2403]] grain offerings, [[H4503]] burnt offerings, [[H5930]] and peace offerings [[H8002]] to make atonement [[H3722]] for [[H1157]] the house [[H1004]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

### 18
This is what [[H3541]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD [[H3068]] says: [[H559]] ‘On the first day [[H259]] of the first month [[H7223]] you are to take [[H3947]] a young bull [[H6499]] without blemish [[H8549]] and purify [[H2398]] the sanctuary. [[H4720]]

### 19
And the priest [[H3548]] is to take [[H3947]] some of the blood [[H1818]] from the sin offering [[H2403]] and put [it] [[H5414]] on [[H413]] the doorposts [[H4201]] of the temple, [[H1004]] on [[H413]] the four [[H702]] corners [[H6438]] of the ledge [[H5835]] of the altar, [[H4196]] and on [[H5921]] the gateposts [[H4201]] of the inner [[H6442]] court. [[H2691]]

### 20
You must do [[H6213]] the same thing [[H3651]] on the seventh [[H7651]] day of the month [[H2320]] for anyone [[H376]] who sins unintentionally [[H7686]] or in ignorance. [[H6612]] In this way you will make atonement [[H3722]] for the temple. [[H1004]]

### 21
On the fourteenth [[H702]] day [[H3117]] of the first month [[H7223]] you are to observe [[H1961]] the Passover, [[H6453]] a feast [[H2282]] of seven [[H7620]] days, [[H3117]] during which unleavened bread [[H4682]] shall be eaten. [[H398]]

### 22
On that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] the prince [[H5387]] shall provide [[H6213]] a bull [[H6499]] as a sin offering [[H2403]] for himself [[H1157]] and for [[H1157]] all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] of the land. [[H776]]

### 23
Each day [[H3117]] during the seven [[H7651]] days [[H3117]] of the feast, [[H2282]] he shall provide [[H6213]] seven [[H7651]] bulls [[H6499]] and seven [[H7651]] rams [[H352]] without blemish [[H8549]] as a burnt offering [[H5930]] to the LORD, [[H3068]] along with a male goat [[H8163]] for a sin offering. [[H2403]]

### 24
He shall also provide [[H6213]] as a grain offering [[H4503]] an ephah [[H374]] for each bull [[H6499]] and an ephah [[H374]] for each ram, [[H352]] along with a hin [[H1969]] of oil [[H8081]] of for each ephah. [[H374]]
