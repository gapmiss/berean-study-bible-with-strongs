###### 1
Again the word [[H1697]] of the LORD [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] to me, [[H413]] saying, [[H559]]

###### 2
“Son [[H1121]] of man, [[H120]] there were [[H1961]] two [[H8147]] women, [[H802]] daughters [[H1323]] of the same [[H259]] mother, [[H517]]

###### 3
and they played [[H2181]] in Egypt, [[H4714]] prostituting themselves [[H2181]] from their youth. [[H5271]] Their breasts [[H7699]] were fondled [[H4600]] there, [[H8033]] and their virgin [[H1331]] bosoms [[H1717]] caressed. [[H6213]]

###### 4
The older [[H1419]] was named [[H8034]] Oholah, [[H170]] and her sister [[H269]] was Oholibah. [[H172]] They became [[H1961]] Mine  and gave birth to [[H3205]] sons [[H1121]] and daughters. [[H1323]] [As] [for] their identities, [[H8034]] Oholah [[H170]] [is] Samaria, [[H8111]] and Oholibah [[H172]] is Jerusalem. [[H3389]]

###### 5
Oholah [[H170]] prostituted herself [[H2181]] while she was still Mine. [[H8478]] She lusted [[H5689]] after [[H5921]] her lovers, [[H157]] the Assyrians— [[H804]] warriors [[H7138]]

###### 6
clothed [[H3847]] in blue, [[H8504]] governors [[H6346]] and commanders, [[H5461]] all [[H3605]] desirable [[H2531]] young men, [[H970]] horsemen [[H6571]] mounted on [[H7392]] steeds. [[H5483]]

###### 7
She offered [[H5414]] sexual favors [[H8457]] to all [[H3605]] the elite [[H4005]] of Assyria. [[H804]] She defiled herself [[H2930]] with all [[H3605]] the idols [[H1544]] of those for whom [[H834]] she lusted. [[H5689]]

###### 8
She did not [[H3808]] give up [[H5800]] the prostitution [[H8457]] [she began] in Egypt, [[H4714]] when [[H3588]] men slept [[H7901]] with her [[H854]] in her youth, [[H5271]] caressed [[H6213]] her virgin [[H1331]] bosom, [[H1717]] and poured out [[H8210]] their lust [[H8457]] upon her. [[H5921]]

###### 9
Therefore [[H3651]] I handed her over to [[H5414]] her lovers, [[H157]] the Assyrians [[H1121]] for whom [[H834]] she lusted. [[H5689]]

###### 10
They [[H1992]] exposed [[H1540]] her nakedness, [[H6172]] seized [[H3947]] her sons [[H1121]] and daughters, [[H1323]] and put her [[H2026]] to the sword. [[H2719]] Thus she became [[H1961]] a byword [[H8034]] among women, [[H802]] and they executed [[H6213]] judgment [[H8196]] against her. 

###### 11
Her sister [[H269]] Oholibah [[H172]] saw [this], [[H7200]] yet in her lust [[H5691]] and [[H853]] prostitution [[H8457]] she was more depraved [[H7843]] than her sister. [[H269]]

###### 12
She too lusted [[H5689]] after [[H413]] the Assyrians— [[H1121]] governors [[H6346]] and commanders, [[H5461]] warriors [[H7138]] dressed [[H3847]] in splendor, [[H4358]] horsemen [[H6571]] riding on [[H7392]] steeds, [[H5483]] all [[H3605]] desirable [[H2531]] young men. [[H970]]

###### 13
And I saw [[H7200]] that [[H3588]] she too had defiled herself; [[H2930]] both of them [[H8147]] had taken the same [[H259]] path. [[H1870]]

###### 14
But [Oholibah] carried [[H3254]] her prostitution {even further}. [[H8457]] She saw [[H7200]] the men [[H376]] portrayed [[H2707]] on [[H5921]] the wall, [[H7023]] images [[H6754]] of the Chaldeans, [[H3778]] engraved [[H2710]] in vermilion, [[H8350]]

###### 15
wearing [[H2289]] belts [[H232]] on their waists [[H4975]] and flowing [[H5628]] turbans [[H2871]] on their heads; [[H7218]] all [[H3605]] of them looked [[H4758]] like officers [[H7991]] of the Babylonians [[H1121]] in Chaldea, [[H3778]] the land [[H776]] of their birth. [[H4138]]

###### 16
At the sight [[H4758]] of them she lusted [[H5689]] for them [[H5921]] and sent [[H7971]] messengers [[H4397]] to them [[H413]] in Chaldea. [[H3778]]

###### 17
Then the Babylonians [[H1121]] came [[H935]] to her, [[H413]] to the bed [[H4904]] of love, [[H1730]] and in their lust [[H8457]] they defiled [[H2930]] her. [[H853]] But after she had been defiled by them, [[H2930]] she [[H5315]] turned away [[H1992]] in disgust. [[H3363]]

###### 18
When [Oholibah] openly [[H1540]] prostituted herself [[H8457]] and exposed [[H1540]] her nakedness, [[H6172]] I [[H5315]] turned away from her [[H5921]] in disgust, [[H3363]] just as [[H834]] I [[H5315]] had turned away [[H5361]] from [[H5921]] her sister. [[H269]]

###### 19
Yet she multiplied [[H7235]] her promiscuity, [[H8457]] remembering [[H2142]] the days [[H3117]] of her youth, [[H5271]] when [[H834]] she had prostituted herself [[H2181]] in the land [[H776]] of Egypt [[H4714]]

###### 20
and lusted [[H5689]] after [[H5921]] their lovers, [[H6370]] whose [[H834]] genitals [[H1320]] were like those [[H1320]] of donkeys [[H2543]] and whose emission [[H2231]] was like that [[H2231]] of stallions. [[H5483]]

###### 21
So you revisited [[H6485]] the indecency [[H2154]] of your youth, [[H5271]] when the Egyptians [[H4714]] caressed [[H6213]] your bosom [[H1717]] and pressed [[H4616]] your young [[H5271]] breasts. [[H7699]]

###### 22
Therefore, [[H3651]] Oholibah, [[H172]] this is what [[H3541]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD [[H3069]] says: [[H559]] ‘I will incite [[H5782]] your lovers [[H157]] against you, [[H5921]] those [[H834]] from whom [[H5315]] you turned in disgust. [[H5361]] And I will bring them [[H935]] against you [[H5921]] from every side— [[H5439]]

###### 23
the Babylonians [[H1121]] and all [[H3605]] the Chaldeans, [[H3778]] [the men of] Pekod, [[H6489]] Shoa, [[H7772]] and Koa, [[H6970]] and all [[H3605]] the Assyrians [[H1121]] with them— [[H854]] all desirable [[H2531]] young men, [[H970]] governors [[H6346]] and commanders, [[H5461]] officers [[H7991]] and administrators, [[H3605]] mounted on [[H7392]] horses. [[H5483]]

###### 24
They will come [[H935]] against you [[H5921]] with a host [[H6951]] of peoples, [[H5971]] with weapons, [[H2021]] chariots, [[H7393]] and wagons. [[H1534]] They will array themselves [[H7760]] against you [[H5921]] on every side [[H5439]] with buckler [[H6793]] and shield [[H4043]] and helmet. [[H6959]] I will delegate [[H5414]] judgment [[H4941]] to them, [[H6440]] and they will punish you [[H8199]] by their own standards. [[H4941]]

###### 25
And I will set [[H5414]] My jealous rage [[H7068]] against you,  and they will deal [[H6213]] with you [[H854]] in fury. [[H2534]] They will cut off [[H5493]] your noses [[H639]] and ears, [[H241]] and your survivors [[H319]] will fall [[H5307]] by the sword. [[H2719]] They [[H1992]] will seize [[H3947]] your sons [[H1121]] and daughters, [[H1323]] and your remnant [[H319]] will be consumed [[H398]] by fire. [[H784]]

###### 26
They will strip off [[H6584]] your clothes [[H899]] and take [[H3947]] your fine [[H8597]] jewelry. [[H3627]]

###### 27
So I will put an end [[H7673]] to [[H4480]] your indecency [[H2154]] and prostitution, [[H2184]] which began in the land [[H776]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] and you will not [[H3808]] lift [[H5375]] your eyes [[H5869]] to them [[H413]] or remember [[H2142]] Egypt [[H4714]] anymore.’ [[H5750]]

###### 28
For [[H3588]] this is what [[H3541]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD [[H3068]] says: [[H559]] ‘Surely [[H2005]] I will deliver you [[H5414]] into the hands of those [[H3027]] you hate, [[H8130]] from whom [[H834]] you turned away [[H5315]] in disgust. [[H5361]]

###### 29
They will treat [[H6213]] you with hatred, [[H8135]] take [[H3947]] all for which [[H3605]] you have worked, [[H3018]] and leave you [[H5800]] naked [[H5903]] and bare, [[H6181]] so that the shame [[H6172]] of your prostitution [[H2183]] will be exposed. [[H1540]] Your indecency [[H2154]] and promiscuity [[H8457]]

###### 30
have brought [[H6213]] these things [[H428]] upon you,  because you have prostituted yourself [[H2181]] with [[H310]] the nations [[H1471]] and defiled yourself [[H2930]] with their idols. [[H1544]]

###### 31
Because you have followed [[H1980]] the path [[H1870]] of your sister, [[H269]] I will put [[H5414]] her cup [[H3563]] into your hand.’ [[H3027]]

###### 32
This is what [[H3541]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD [[H3069]] says: [[H559]] ‘You will drink [[H8354]] your sister’s [[H269]] cup, [[H3563]] a cup deep [[H6013]] and wide. [[H7342]] It will bring [[H1961]] scorn [[H6712]] and derision, [[H3932]] for it holds [[H3557]] so much. [[H4767]]

###### 33
You will be filled [[H4390]] with drunkenness [[H7943]] and grief, [[H3015]] with a cup [[H3563]] of devastation [[H8047]] and desolation, [[H8077]] the cup [[H3563]] of your sister [[H269]] Samaria. [[H8111]]

###### 34
You will drink [[H8354]] it dry; [[H4680]] you will dash it [[H1633]] to pieces, [[H2789]] and tear [[H5423]] your breasts. [[H7699]] For [[H3588]] I [[H589]] have spoken,’ [[H1696]] declares [[H5002]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD. [[H3069]]

###### 35
Therefore, [[H3651]] this is what [[H3541]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD [[H3069]] says: [[H559]] ‘Because [[H3282]] you have forgotten [[H7911]] Me [[H853]] and have cast [[H7993]] Me [[H853]] behind [[H310]] your back, [[H1458]] you [[H859]] must bear the consequences [[H5375]] [of] your indecency [[H2154]] and [[H853]] prostitution.’” [[H8457]]

###### 36
Then the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H559]] to me: [[H413]] “Son [[H1121]] of man, [[H120]] will you pass judgment [[H8199]] against Oholah [[H170]] and Oholibah? [[H172]] Then declare [[H5046]] to them  their abominations. [[H8441]]

###### 37
For [[H3588]] they have committed adultery, [[H5003]] and blood [[H1818]] is on their hands; [[H3027]] they have committed adultery [[H5003]] with their idols. [[H1544]] They have even [[H1571]] sacrificed their children, [[H1121]] whom [[H834]] they bore [[H3205]] to Me,  in the fire [[H5674]] as food [[H402]] for their idols. 

###### 38
They have also [[H5750]] done [[H6213]] to Me  this: [[H2063]] On that very same [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] they defiled [[H2930]] My sanctuary [[H4720]] and profaned [[H2490]] My Sabbaths. [[H7676]]

###### 39
On the very [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] they slaughtered [[H7819]] their children [[H1121]] for their idols, [[H1544]] they entered [[H935]] My sanctuary [[H4720]] to profane it. [[H2490]] Yes, [[H2009]] this [[H3541]] they did [[H6213]] inside [[H8432]] My house. [[H1004]]

###### 40
Furthermore, [[H637]] they sent [[H7971]] messengers [[H4397]] for men [[H376]] who came [[H935]] from afar; [[H4801]] and behold, [[H2009]] when they arrived, [[H935]] you bathed [[H7364]] for them, [[H834]] painted [[H3583]] your eyes, [[H5869]] and adorned yourself [[H5710]] with jewelry. [[H5716]]

###### 41
You sat [[H3427]] on [[H5921]] a couch [[H4296]] of luxury [[H3520]] with a table [[H7979]] spread [[H6186]] before it, [[H6440]] on [[H5921]] which you had set [[H7760]] My incense [[H7004]] and My oil. [[H8081]]

###### 42
The sound [[H6963]] of a carefree [[H7961]] crowd [[H1995]] accompanied her.  Sabeans [[H5433]] were brought in [[H935]] from the desert [[H4057]] along with [[H413]] men [[H376]] from the rabble, [[H7230]] who put [[H5414]] bracelets [[H6781]] on [[H413]] your wrists [[H3027]] and beautiful [[H8597]] crowns [[H5850]] on [[H5921]] your head. [[H7218]]

###### 43
Then I said [[H559]] of [her] [who] [had] [grown] old [[H1087]] in adulteries: [[H5004]] ‘Now  let them use her as a prostitute, [[H2181]] for that is all she is!’ [[H1931]]

###### 44
And they slept [[H935]] with her [[H413]] as with [[H3651]] a prostitute; [[H802]] they slept with [[H935]] Oholah [[H170]] and Oholibah, [[H172]] those lewd [[H2154]] women. [[H802]]

###### 45
But righteous [[H6662]] men [[H376]] will sentence [[H8199]] them [[H853]] to the punishment of [[H4941]] those who commit adultery [[H5003]] and bloodshed, [[H8210]] because [[H3588]] they [[H2007]] are adulteresses [[H5003]] with blood [[H1818]] on their hands. [[H3027]]

###### 46
This is what [[H3541]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD [[H3069]] says: [[H559]] ‘Bring a mob [[H6951]] against them [[H5921]] and consign [[H5414]] them [[H853]] to terror [[H2189]] and plunder. [[H957]]

###### 47
The mob [[H6951]] will stone [[H7275]] them [[H5921]] and cut them [[H68]] down [[H1254]] with their swords. [[H2719]] They will kill [[H2026]] their sons [[H1121]] and daughters [[H1323]] and burn down [[H8313]] their houses. [[H1004]]

###### 48
So I will put an end [[H7673]] to indecency [[H2154]] in [[H4480]] the land, [[H776]] and all [[H3605]] the women [[H802]] will be admonished [[H3256]] not [[H3808]] to imitate [[H6213]] your behavior. [[H2154]]

###### 49
They will repay [[H5414]] you for your indecency, [[H2154]] and you will bear the consequences [[H5375]] of your sins [[H2399]] of idolatry. [[H1544]] Then you will know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I [[H589]] am the Lord [[H136]] GOD.’” [[H3069]]
