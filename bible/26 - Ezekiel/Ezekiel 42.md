### 1
Then the man led me out [[H3318]] northward [[H6828]] into [[H413]] the outer [[H2435]] court, [[H2691]] and he brought me [[H935]] to [[H413]] the group of chambers [[H3957]] opposite [[H5048]] the temple courtyard [[H1508]] and [[H5048]] the [outer wall] [[H1146]] on [[H413]] the north side. [[H6828]]

### 2
The building [[H753]] with the door [[H6607]] facing north [[H6828]] [was] a hundred [[H3967]] cubits [[H520]] long [[H7341]] [and] fifty [[H2572]] cubits wide. [[H520]]

### 3
Gallery [[H862]] faced [[H6440]] gallery [[H862]] in three levels, [[H7992]] opposite [[H5048]] the twenty [cubits] [[H6242]] that [[H834]] belonged to the inner [[H6442]] court [[H2691]] and opposite [[H5048]] the pavement [[H7531]] that [[H834]] belonged to the outer [[H2435]] court. [[H2691]]

### 4
In front [[H6440]] of the chambers [[H3957]] [was] an inner walkway [[H4109]] ten [[H6235]] cubits [[H520]] wide [[H7341]] and a [hundred] [[H259]] cubits [[H520]] long. [[H1870]] Their doors [[H6607]] were on the north. [[H6828]]

### 5
Now the upper [[H5945]] chambers [[H3957]] [were] smaller [[H7114]] because [[H3588]] the galleries [[H862]] took more space [[H3201]] from the chambers [[H2007]] on the lower [[H8481]] and middle floors [[H8484]] of the building. [[H1146]]

### 6
For [[H3588]] they [[H2007]] were arranged in three stories [[H8027]] and had no [[H369]] pillars [[H5982]] like those [[H5982]] of the courts; [[H2691]] so [[H5921]] the upper chambers were set back further [[H680]] than the lower [[H8481]] and middle floors. [[H8484]]

### 7
A wall [[H1447]] on the outside [[H2351]] ran in [[H413]] front [[H6440]] of the chambers, [[H3957]] parallel to them, [[H5980]] toward [[H1870]] the outer [[H2435]] court, [[H2691]] for fifty [[H2572]] cubits. [[H520]]

### 8
For [[H3588]] the chambers [[H3957]] on the outer [[H2435]] court [[H2691]] [were] fifty [[H2572]] cubits [[H520]] long, [[H753]] while those facing [[H5921]] the temple [[H1964]] [were] a hundred [[H3967]] cubits [long]. [[H520]]

### 9
And below [[H8478]] these [[H428]] chambers [was] [[H3957]] the entrance [[H3996]] on the east side [[H6921]] as one enters [[H935]] them [[H2007]] from the outer [[H2435]] court. [[H2691]]

### 10
On the [[H1870]] south side [[H6921]] along the length [[H7341]] of the wall [[H1444]] of the outer court [[H2691]] [were] chambers, [[H3957]] adjoining [[H6440]] the courtyard [[H1508]] and [[H413]] opposite [[H6440]] the building, [[H1146]]

### 11
with a passageway [[H1870]] in front of them, [[H6440]] just like the chambers [[H3957]] that were [[H834]] on [[H1870]] the north. [[H6828]] They had the same length [[H753]] and width, [[H7341]] as well as all [[H3605]] their exits, [[H4161]] measurements, [[H4941]] and entrances. [[H6607]]

### 12
And corresponding to the doors [[H6607]] of the chambers [[H3957]] that [were] [[H834]] facing [[H1870]] south, [[H1864]] [there] [was] a door [[H6607]] in front [[H7218]] of the walkway [[H1870]] that was parallel [[H6440]] to the wall [[H1448]] extending [[H1903]] eastward. [[H6921]]

### 13
Then the man said [[H559]] to me, [[H413]] “The north [[H6828]] [and] south [[H1864]] chambers [[H3957]] facing [[H413]] the temple courtyard [[H1508]] are the holy [[H6944]] chambers [[H3957]] where [[H834]] the priests [[H3548]] who [[H834]] approach [[H7138]] the LORD [[H3069]] will eat [[H398]] the most holy offerings. [[H6944]] There [[H8033]] they will place [[H3240]] the most holy offerings— [[H6944]] the grain offerings, [[H4503]] the sin offerings, [[H2403]] and the guilt offerings— [[H817]] for [[H3588]] the place [[H4725]] is holy. [[H6918]]

### 14
Once the priests [[H3548]] have entered [[H935]] the holy area, [[H6944]] they must not [[H3808]] go out [[H3318]] into [[H413]] the outer [[H2435]] court [[H2691]] until they have left behind [[H3240]] the garments [[H899]] in which they minister, [[H8334]] for [[H3588]] these [[H2007]] are holy. [[H6944]] They are to put on [[H3847]] other [[H312]] clothes [[H899]] before they approach [[H7126]] the places [[H834]] that are [[H834]] for the people. [[H5971]]

### 15
Now when [the man] had finished [[H3615]] measuring [[H4060]] the interior [[H6442]] of the temple area, [[H1004]] he led me out [[H3318]] by [[H1870]] the gate [[H8179]] that [[H834]] faced [[H6440]] east, [[H6921]] and he measured [the area] [[H4058]] all [[H5439]] around: [[H5439]]

### 16
With a measuring [[H4060]] rod [[H7070]] he measured [[H4058]] the east [[H6921]] side [[H7307]] [to be] five [[H2568]] hundred [[H520]] cubits [[H7070]] [long]. [[H5439]]

### 17
He measured [[H4058]] the north [[H6828]] side [[H7307]] [to be] five [[H2568]] hundred [[H3967]] cubits [[H7070]] [long]. [[H4060]]

### 18
He measured [[H4058]] the south [[H1864]] side [[H7307]] [to be] five [[H2568]] hundred [[H3967]] cubits [[H7070]] [long]. [[H4060]]

### 19
And he came around [[H5437]] and measured [[H4058]] the west [[H3220]] side [[H7307]] [to be] five [[H2568]] hundred [[H3967]] cubits [[H7070]] [long]. [[H4060]]

### 20
So he measured [[H4058]] the area on all four [[H702]] sides. [[H7307]] It had a wall [[H2346]] all [[H5439]] around, [[H5439]] five [[H2568]] hundred [cubits] [[H3967]] long [[H753]] and five [[H2568]] hundred [cubits] [[H3967]] wide, [[H7341]] to separate [[H914]] the holy [[H6944]] from the common.
