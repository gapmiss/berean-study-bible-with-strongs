###### 1
In the sixth [[H8345]] year, [[H8141]] in the sixth month, [[H8345]] on the fifth [[H2568]] day, [[H2320]] I [[H589]] was sitting [[H3427]] in my house, [[H1004]] and the elders [[H2205]] of Judah [[H3063]] were sitting [[H3427]] before me; [[H6440]] and there [[H8033]] the hand [[H3027]] of the Lord [[H136]] GOD [[H3069]] fell [[H5307]] upon me. [[H5921]]

###### 2
Then I looked [[H7200]] and saw [[H2009]] a figure [[H1823]] like that of a man. [[H4758]] From what appeared to be [[H4758]] His waist [[H4975]] down [[H4295]] was fire, [[H784]] and from His waist [[H4975]] up [[H4605]] his appearance [[H4758]] was as bright [[H2096]] as the gleam [[H5869]] of amber. [[H2830]]

###### 3
He stretched out [[H7971]] what looked like [[H8403]] a hand [[H3027]] and took [[H3947]] me by the hair [[H6734]] of my head. [[H7218]] Then the Spirit [[H7307]] lifted me up [[H5375]] between [[H996]] earth [[H776]] and heaven [[H8064]] and carried [[H935]] me in visions [[H4759]] of God [[H430]] to Jerusalem, [[H3389]] to [[H413]] the entrance [[H6607]] of the north [[H6828]] gate [[H8179]] of the inner court, [[H6442]] where [[H834]] the idol [[H5566]] that provokes [[H7069]] jealousy [[H7068]] was located. [[H4186]]

###### 4
And there [[H8033]] I saw [[H2009]] the glory [[H3519]] of the God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] like the vision [[H4758]] I had seen [[H7200]] in the plain. [[H1237]]

###### 5
“Son [[H1121]] of man,” [[H120]] He said [[H559]] to me, [[H413]] “now [[H4994]] lift up [[H5375]] your eyes [[H5869]] to [[H1870]] the north.” [[H6828]] So I lifted up [[H5375]] my eyes [[H5869]] to [[H1870]] the north, [[H6828]] and in the entrance [[H872]] north [[H6828]] of the gate [[H8179]] of the altar [[H4196]] I saw [[H2009]] this [[H2088]] idol [[H5566]] of jealousy. [[H7068]]

###### 6
“Son [[H1121]] of man,” [[H120]] He said [[H559]] to me, [[H413]] “do you [[H859]] see [[H7200]] what they [[H1992]] are doing— [[H6213]] the great [[H1419]] abominations [[H8441]] that [[H834]] the house [[H1004]] of Israel [[H3478]] is committing— [[H6213]] to drive Me far [[H7368]] from [[H5921]] My sanctuary? [[H4720]] Yet [[H5750]] you will see [[H7200]] even greater [[H1419]] abominations.” [[H8441]]

###### 7
Then He brought [[H935]] me to [[H413]] the entrance [[H6607]] of the court, [[H2691]] and I looked [[H7200]] and saw [[H2009]] a [[H259]] hole [[H2356]] in the wall. [[H7023]]

###### 8
“Son [[H1121]] of man,” [[H120]] He told [[H559]] me, [[H413]] “dig [[H2864]] through the wall.” [[H7023]] So I dug [[H2864]] through the wall [[H7023]] and discovered [[H2009]] a doorway. [[H6607]]

###### 9
Then He said [[H559]] to me, [[H413]] “Go in [[H935]] and see [[H7200]] the wicked [[H7451]] abominations [[H8441]] they [[H1992]] are committing [[H6213]] here.” [[H6311]]

###### 10
So I went in [[H935]] and looked, [[H7200]] and [[H2009]] engraved [[H2707]] all around [[H5439]] the wall [[H7023]] was every [[H3605]] kind [[H8403]] of crawling creature [[H7431]] and detestable [[H8263]] beast, [[H929]] along with all [[H3605]] the idols [[H1544]] of the house [[H1004]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

###### 11
Before them [[H6440]] stood [[H5975]] seventy [[H7657]] elders [[H2205]] of the house [[H1004]] of Israel, [[H3478]] with Jaazaniah [[H2970]] son [[H1121]] of Shaphan [[H8227]] standing [[H5975]] among them. [[H8432]] Each [[H376]] had a censer [[H4730]] in his hand, [[H3027]] and a fragrant [[H6282]] cloud [[H6051]] of incense [[H7004]] was rising. [[H5927]]

###### 12
“Son [[H1121]] of man,” [[H120]] He said [[H559]] to me, [[H413]] “do you see [[H7200]] what [[H834]] the elders [[H2205]] of the house [[H1004]] of Israel [[H3478]] are doing [[H6213]] in the darkness, [[H2822]] each [[H376]] at the shrine [[H2315]] of his own idol? [[H4906]] For [[H3588]] they are saying, [[H559]] ‘The LORD [[H3069]] does not [[H369]] see [[H7200]] us; [[H853]] the LORD [[H3069]] has forsaken [[H5800]] the land.” [[H776]]

###### 13
Again, [[H5750]] He told [[H559]] me, [[H413]] “You will see [[H7200]] them [[H1992]] committing [[H6213]] even greater [[H1419]] abominations.” [[H8441]]

###### 14
Then He brought [[H935]] me to [[H413]] the entrance [[H6607]] of the north [[H6828]] gate [[H8179]] of the house [[H1004]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] and I saw [[H2009]] women [[H802]] sitting [[H3427]] there, [[H8033]] weeping [[H1058]] for Tammuz. [[H8542]]

###### 15
And He said [[H559]] to me, [[H413]] “Do you see [[H7200]] this, son [[H1121]] of man? [[H120]] You will see [[H7200]] even greater [[H1419]] abominations [[H8441]] than these.” [[H428]]

###### 16
So He brought [[H935]] me to [[H413]] the inner [[H6442]] court [[H2691]] of the house [[H1004]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] and there [[H2009]] at the entrance [[H6607]] to the temple [[H1964]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] between [[H996]] the portico [[H197]] and the altar, [[H4196]] were about twenty-five [[H6242]] men [[H376]] with their backs [[H268]] to [[H413]] the temple [[H1964]] of the LORD [[H3068]] and their faces [[H6440]] toward the east; [[H6924]] and they [[H1992]] were bowing to the east [[H6924]] in worship [[H7812]] of the sun. [[H8121]]

###### 17
And He said [[H559]] to me, [[H413]] “Do you see this, [[H7200]] son [[H1121]] of man? [[H120]] Is it not enough for the house [[H1004]] of Judah [[H3063]] to commit [[H6213]] the abominations [[H8441]] they are practicing [[H6213]] here, [[H6311]] that [[H3588]] they must also fill [[H4390]] the land [[H776]] with violence [[H2555]] and continually [[H7725]] provoke Me to anger? [[H3707]] Look, they are even [[H2005]] putting [[H7971]] the branch [[H2156]] to [[H413]] their nose! [[H639]]

###### 18
Therefore [[H1571]] I [[H589]] will respond [[H6213]] with wrath. [[H2534]] I will not [[H3808]] look on them [[H5869]] with pity [[H2347]] or spare them. [[H2550]] Although they shout [[H7121]] loudly [[H1419]] in My ears, [[H241]] I will not [[H3808]] listen to them.” [[H8085]]
