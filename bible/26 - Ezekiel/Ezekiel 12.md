### 1
Then the word [[H1697]] of the LORD [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] to me, [[H413]] saying, [[H559]]

### 2
“Son [[H1121]] of man, [[H120]] you [[H859]] are living [[H3427]] in [[H8432]] a rebellious [[H4805]] house. [[H1004]] They have eyes [[H5869]] to see [[H7200]] but do not [[H3808]] see, [[H7200]] and ears [[H241]] to hear [[H8085]] but do not [[H3808]] hear, [[H8085]] for [[H3588]] they [[H1992]] are a rebellious [[H4805]] house. [[H1004]]

### 3
Therefore, [[H859]] son [[H1121]] of man, [[H120]] pack [[H6213]] your bags [[H3627]] for exile. [[H1473]] In broad daylight, [[H3119]] set out and go [[H1540]] from your place [[H4725]] to [[H413]] another [[H312]] as they look on. [[H5869]] Perhaps [[H194]] they will understand, [[H7200]] though [[H3588]] they [[H1992]] are a rebellious [[H4805]] house. [[H1004]]

### 4
Bring out [[H3318]] your baggage [[H3627]] for exile [[H1473]] by day, [[H3119]] as they look on. [[H5869]] Then in the evening, [[H6153]] as they look on, [[H5869]] go out [[H3318]] like those who go [[H4161]] into exile. [[H1473]]

### 5
While they watch, [[H5869]] dig [[H2864]] through the wall [[H7023]] and carry [your belongings] [[H3318]] out through it. 

### 6
And as they look on, [[H5869]] lift [[H5375]] your bags to [[H5921]] your shoulder [[H3802]] and take them out [[H3318]] at dusk; [[H5939]] cover [[H3680]] your face [[H6440]] so that you cannot [[H3808]] see [[H7200]] the land. [[H776]] For [[H3588]] I have made you [[H5414]] a sign [[H4159]] to the house [[H1004]] of Israel.” [[H3478]]

### 7
So I did [[H6213]] as [[H834]] I was commanded. [[H6680]] I brought out [[H3318]] my bags [[H3627]] for exile [[H1473]] by day, [[H3119]] and in the evening [[H6153]] I dug [[H2864]] through the wall [[H7023]] by hand. [[H3027]] I took [my belongings] out [[H3318]] at dusk, [[H5939]] carrying [[H5375]] them on [[H5921]] my shoulder [[H3802]] as they watched. [[H5869]]

### 8
And in the morning [[H1242]] the word [[H1697]] of the LORD [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] to me, [[H413]] saying, [[H559]]

### 9
“Son [[H1121]] of man, [[H120]] hasn’t [[H3808]] the rebellious [[H4805]] house [[H1004]] of Israel [[H3478]] asked [[H559]] you, [[H413]] ‘What [[H4100]] are you [[H859]] doing?’ [[H6213]]

### 10
Tell [[H559]] them [[H413]] that this is what [[H3541]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD [[H3069]] says: [[H559]] ‘This [[H2088]] oracle [[H4853]] [concerns] the prince [[H5387]] in Jerusalem [[H3389]] and all [[H3605]] the house [[H1004]] of Israel [[H3478]] who [[H834]] are [[H1992]] there.’ [[H8432]]

### 11
You are to say, [[H559]] ‘I [[H589]] am a sign for you. [[H4159]] Just as [[H834]] I have done, [[H6213]] so [[H3651]] will it be done to them; [[H6213]] they will go [[H1980]] into exile [[H1473]] as captives.’ [[H7628]]

### 12
And at dusk [[H5939]] the prince [[H5387]] among them [[H8432]] will lift [[H5375]] his bags to [[H413]] his shoulder [[H3802]] and go out. [[H3318]] They will dig [[H2864]] through the wall [[H7023]] to bring him out. [[H3318]] He will cover [[H3680]] his face [[H6440]] so [[H3282]] he [[H1931]] cannot [[H3808]] see [[H7200]] the land. [[H776]]

### 13
But I will spread [[H6566]] My net [[H7568]] over him, [[H5921]] and he will be caught [[H8610]] in My snare. [[H4686]] I will bring [[H935]] him to Babylon, [[H894]] the land [[H776]] of the Chaldeans; [[H3778]] yet he will not [[H3808]] see it, [[H7200]] and there [[H8033]] he will die. [[H4191]]

### 14
I will also scatter [[H2219]] to the winds [[H7307]] all [[H3605]] the attendants [[H5828]] around him [[H5439]] and all [[H3605]] his troops, [[H102]] and I will draw [[H7324]] a sword [[H2719]] to chase after them. [[H310]]

### 15
And they will know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I [[H589]] am the LORD [[H3068]] when I disperse [[H6327]] them [[H853]] among the nations [[H1471]] and scatter [[H2219]] them [[H853]] throughout the countries. [[H776]]

### 16
But I will spare [[H3498]] a few [[H4557]] of them [[H1992]] from the sword, [[H2719]] famine, [[H7458]] and plague, [[H1698]] so that [[H4616]] they can tell [[H5608]] of all [[H3605]] their abominations [[H8441]] among the nations [[H1471]] to which [[H834]] they go. [[H935]] Then they will know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I [[H589]] am the LORD.” [[H3068]]

### 17
Moreover, the word [[H1697]] of the LORD [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] to me, [[H413]] saying, [[H559]]

### 18
“Son [[H1121]] of man, [[H120]] eat [[H398]] your bread [[H3899]] with trembling, [[H7494]] and drink [[H8354]] your water [[H4325]] with quivering [[H7269]] and anxiety. [[H1674]]

### 19
Then tell [[H559]] the people [[H5971]] of the land [[H776]] that this is what [[H3541]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD [[H3069]] says [[H559]] about those living [[H3427]] in Jerusalem [[H3389]] [and] in [[H413]] the land [[H127]] of Israel: [[H3478]] ‘They will eat [[H398]] their bread [[H3899]] with anxiety [[H1674]] and drink [[H8354]] their water [[H4325]] in dread, [[H8078]] for [[H4616]] their land [[H776]] will be stripped [[H3456]] of everything in it [[H4393]] because of the violence [[H2555]] of all [[H3605]] those who dwell [[H3427]] in it. 

### 20
The inhabited [[H3427]] cities [[H5892]] will be laid waste, [[H2717]] and the land [[H776]] will become [[H1961]] desolate. [[H8077]] Then you will know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I [[H589]] am the LORD.’” [[H3068]]

### 21
Again the word [[H1697]] of the LORD [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] to me, [[H413]] saying, [[H559]]

### 22
“Son [[H1121]] of man, [[H120]] what [[H4100]] is this [[H2088]] proverb [[H4912]] [that] you have in [[H5921]] the land [[H127]] of Israel: [[H3478]] ‘The days [[H3117]] go by, [[H748]] and every [[H3605]] vision [[H2377]] fails’? [[H6]]

### 23
Therefore [[H3651]] tell [[H559]] them [[H413]] that this is what [[H3541]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD [[H3068]] says: [[H559]] ‘I will put an end [[H7673]] to this [[H2088]] proverb, [[H4912]] and in Israel [[H3478]] they will no longer [[H3808]] recite [[H4911]] it.’ [[H853]] But [[H3588]] say [[H1696]] to them: [[H413]] ‘The days [[H3117]] are at hand [[H7126]] when every [[H3605]] vision [[H2377]] will be fulfilled. [[H1697]]

### 24
For [[H3588]] there will be [[H1961]] no [[H3808]] more [[H5750]] FALSE [[H7723]] visions [[H2377]] or flattering [[H2509]] divinations [[H4738]] within [[H8432]] the house [[H1004]] of Israel, [[H3478]]

### 25
because [[H3588]] I, [[H589]] the LORD, [[H3068]] will speak [[H1696]] whatever [[H834]] word [[H1697]] I speak, [[H1696]] and it will be fulfilled [[H6213]] without [[H3808]] delay. [[H4900]] For [[H3588]] in your days, [[H3117]] O rebellious [[H4805]] house, [[H1004]] I will speak [[H1696]] a message [[H1697]] and bring it to pass, [[H6213]] declares [[H5002]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD.’” [[H3069]]

### 26
Furthermore, the word [[H1697]] of the LORD [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] to me, [[H413]] saying, [[H559]]

### 27
“Son [[H1121]] of man, [[H120]] take note [[H2009]] that the house [[H1004]] of Israel [[H3478]] is saying, [[H559]] ‘The vision [[H2377]] that [[H834]] he [[H1931]] sees [[H2372]] is for many [[H7227]] years from now; [[H3117]] he [[H1931]] prophesies [[H5012]] about the distant [[H7350]] future.’ [[H6256]]

### 28
Therefore [[H3651]] tell [[H559]] them [[H413]] that this is what [[H3541]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD [[H3069]] says: [[H559]] ‘None [[H3808]] of My words [[H1697]] will be delayed [[H4900]] any longer. [[H5750]] The message [[H1697]] I speak [[H1696]] will be fulfilled, [[H6213]] declares [[H5002]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD.’” [[H3069]]
