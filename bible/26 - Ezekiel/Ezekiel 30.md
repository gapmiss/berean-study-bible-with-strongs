### 1
Again the word [[H1697]] of the LORD [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] to me, [[H413]] saying, [[H559]]

### 2
“Son [[H1121]] of man, [[H120]] prophesy [[H5012]] and declare [[H559]] that this is what [[H3541]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD [[H3069]] says: [[H559]] ‘Wail, [[H3213]] “Alas, [[H1929]] the day [is here]!” [[H3117]]

### 3
For [[H3588]] the day [is] [[H3117]] near, [[H7138]] the Day [[H3117]] of the LORD [[H3068]] is near. [[H7138]] It will be [[H1961]] a day [[H3117]] of clouds, [[H6051]] a time [[H6256]] of doom for the nations. [[H1471]]

### 4
A sword [[H2719]] will come [[H935]] against Egypt, [[H4714]] and there will be anguish [[H2479]] in Cush [[H3568]] when the slain [[H2491]] fall [[H5307]] in Egypt, [[H4714]] its wealth [[H1995]] is taken away, [[H3947]] and its foundations [[H3247]] are torn down. [[H2040]]

### 5
Cush, [[H3568]] Put, [[H6316]] and Lud, [[H3865]] and all [[H3605]] the various peoples, [[H6154]] as well as Libya [[H3552]] and the men [[H1121]] of the covenant [[H1285]] land, [[H776]] will fall [[H5307]] by the sword [[H2719]] along with [Egypt].’ [[H854]]

### 6
For this is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] says: [[H559]] ‘The allies [[H5564]] of Egypt [[H4714]] will fall, [[H5307]] and her proud [[H1347]] strength [[H5797]] will collapse. [[H3381]] From Migdol [[H4024]] to Syene [[H5482]] they will fall [[H5307]] by the sword [[H2719]] within her,  declares [[H5002]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD. [[H3069]]

### 7
They will be desolate [[H8074]] among [[H8432]] desolate [[H8074]] lands, [[H776]] and their cities [[H5892]] will lie [[H1961]] among [[H8432]] ruined [[H2717]] cities. [[H5892]]

### 8
Then they will know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I [[H589]] am the LORD [[H3068]] when I set [[H5414]] fire [[H784]] to Egypt [[H4714]] and all [[H3605]] her helpers [[H5826]] are shattered.’ [[H7665]]

### 9
On that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] messengers [[H4397]] will go out [[H3318]] from Me [[H6440]] in ships, [[H6716]] to frighten [[H2729]] Cush [[H3568]] out of complacency. [[H983]] Anguish [[H2479]] will come upon them [[H1961]] on the day [[H3117]] of Egypt’s [doom]. [[H4714]] For [[H3588]] it is indeed [[H2009]] coming. [[H935]]

### 10
This is what [[H3541]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD [[H3069]] says: [[H559]] ‘I will put an end [[H7673]] to the hordes [[H1995]] of Egypt [[H4714]] by the hand [[H3027]] of Nebuchadnezzar [[H5019]] king [[H4428]] of Babylon. [[H894]]

### 11
He [[H1931]] and his people [[H5971]] with him, [[H854]] the most ruthless [[H6184]] of the nations, [[H1471]] will be brought in [[H935]] to destroy [[H7843]] the land. [[H776]] They will draw [[H7324]] their swords [[H2719]] against [[H5921]] Egypt [[H4714]] and fill [[H4390]] the land [[H776]] with the slain. [[H2491]]

### 12
I will make [[H5414]] the streams [[H2975]] dry up [[H2724]] and sell [[H4376]] the land [[H776]] to [[H3027]] the wicked. [[H7451]] By the hands [[H3027]] of foreigners [[H2114]] I will bring desolation [[H8074]] upon the land [[H776]] and everything in it.’ [[H4393]] I, [[H589]] the LORD, [[H3068]] have spoken. [[H1696]]

### 13
This is what [[H3541]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD [[H3069]] says: [[H559]] ‘I will destroy [[H6]] the idols [[H1544]] and put an end [[H7673]] to the images [[H457]] in Memphis. [[H5297]] There will no [[H3808]] longer [[H5750]] be [[H1961]] a prince [[H5387]] in Egypt, [[H4714]] and I will instill [[H5414]] fear [[H3374]] in that land. [[H776]]

### 14
I will lay waste [[H8074]] to Pathros, [[H6624]] set [[H5414]] fire [[H784]] to Zoan, [[H6814]] and execute [[H6213]] judgment [[H8201]] on Thebes. [[H4996]]

### 15
I will pour out [[H8210]] My wrath [[H2534]] on [[H5921]] Pelusium, [[H5512]] the stronghold [[H4581]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] and cut off [[H3772]] the crowds [[H1995]] of Thebes. [[H4996]]

### 16
I will set [[H5414]] fire [[H784]] to Egypt; [[H4714]] Pelusium [[H5512]] will writhe in anguish, [[H2342]] Thebes [[H4996]] will be [[H1961]] split open, [[H1234]] and Memphis [[H5297]] [will face] daily [[H3119]] distress. [[H6862]]

### 17
The young men [[H970]] of On [[H206]] and Pi-beseth [[H6364]] will fall [[H5307]] by the sword, [[H2719]] and those [cities] [[H2007]] will go [[H1980]] into captivity. [[H7628]]

### 18
The day [[H3117]] will be darkened [[H2821]] in Tehaphnehes [[H8471]] when I break [[H7665]] there [[H8033]] the yoke [[H4133]] of Egypt [[H4714]] and  her proud [[H1347]] strength [[H5797]] comes to an end. [[H7673]] A cloud [[H6051]] will cover her, [[H3680]] and her daughters [[H1323]] will go [[H1980]] into captivity. [[H7628]]

### 19
So I will execute [[H6213]] judgment [[H8201]] on Egypt, [[H4714]] and they will know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I [[H589]] am the LORD.’” [[H3068]]

### 20
In the eleventh [[H259]] year, [[H8141]] in the first month, [[H7223]] on the seventh [[H7651]] day, [[H2320]] the word [[H1697]] of the LORD [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] to me, [[H413]] saying, [[H559]]

### 21
“Son [[H1121]] of man, [[H120]] I have broken [[H7665]] the arm [[H2220]] of Pharaoh [[H6547]] king [[H4428]] of Egypt. [[H4714]] See, [[H2009]] it has not [[H3808]] been bound [[H2280]] up for healing [[H7499]] or splinted [[H2848]] to give it strength [[H2388]] to handle [[H8610]] a sword. [[H2719]]

### 22
Therefore [[H3651]] this is what [[H3541]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD [[H3069]] says: [[H559]] ‘Behold, [[H2005]] I am against [[H413]] Pharaoh [[H6547]] king [[H4428]] of Egypt. [[H4714]] I will break [[H7665]] his arms, [[H2220]] both the strong one [[H2389]] and the one already broken, [[H7665]] and will make the sword [[H2719]] fall [[H5307]] from his hand. [[H3027]]

### 23
I will disperse [[H6327]] the Egyptians [[H4714]] among the nations [[H1471]] and scatter them [[H2219]] throughout the lands. [[H776]]

### 24
I will strengthen [[H2388]] the arms [[H2220]] of Babylon’s [[H894]] king [[H4428]] and place [[H5414]] My sword [[H2719]] in his hand, [[H3027]] but I will break [[H7665]] the arms [[H2220]] of Pharaoh, [[H6547]] and he will groan [[H5008]] before him [[H6440]] like [[H5009]] a [mortally] wounded [man]. [[H2491]]

### 25
I will strengthen [[H2388]] the arms [[H2220]] of Babylon’s [[H894]] king, [[H4428]] but Pharaoh’s [[H6547]] arms [[H2220]] will fall limp. [[H5307]] Then they will know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I [[H589]] am the LORD, [[H3068]] when I place [[H5414]] My sword [[H2719]] in the hand [[H3027]] of Babylon’s [[H894]] king, [[H4428]] and he wields [[H5186]] it against [[H413]] the land [[H776]] of Egypt. [[H4714]]

### 26
When I disperse [[H6327]] the Egyptians [[H4714]] among the nations [[H1471]] and scatter [[H2219]] them [[H853]] throughout the lands, [[H776]] they will know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I [[H589]] am the LORD.’” [[H3068]]
