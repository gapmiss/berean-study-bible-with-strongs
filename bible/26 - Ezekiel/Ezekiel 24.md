###### 1
In the ninth [[H8671]] year, [[H8141]] on the tenth [[H6218]] day [[H2320]] of the tenth [[H6224]] month, [[H2320]] the word [[H1697]] of the LORD [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] to me, [[H413]] saying, [[H559]]

###### 2
“Son [[H1121]] of man, [[H120]] write down [[H3789]] today’s date, [[H3117]] for [[H853]] on this [[H2088]] very [[H6106]] day [[H3117]] the king [[H4428]] of Babylon [[H894]] has laid siege [[H5564]] to [[H413]] Jerusalem. [[H3389]]

###### 3
Now speak a parable [[H4911]] to [[H413]] this rebellious [[H4805]] house [[H1004]] and tell [[H559]] them [[H413]] that this is what [[H3541]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD [[H3069]] says: [[H559]] ‘Put the pot [[H5518]] on the fire; [[H8239]] put it on [[H8239]] and [[H1571]] pour [[H3332]] in  the water. [[H4325]]

###### 4
Put in [[H622]] the pieces [[H5409]] of meat, [[H413]] every [[H3605]] good [[H2896]] piece— [[H5409]] thigh [[H3409]] and shoulder— [[H3802]] fill [[H4390]] it with choice [[H4005]] bones. [[H6106]]

###### 5
Take [[H3947]] the choicest [[H4005]] of the flock [[H6629]] and [[H1571]] pile the fuel [[H1754]] beneath it. [[H8478]] Bring it to a boil [[H7570]] and [[H1571]] cook [[H1310]] the bones [[H6106]] in it.’ [[H8432]]

###### 6
Therefore [[H3651]] this is what [[H3541]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD [[H3069]] says: [[H559]] ‘Woe [[H188]] to the city [[H5892]] of bloodshed, [[H1818]] to the pot [[H5518]] now rusted, [[H2457]] whose rust [[H2457]] will not [[H3808]] come off! [[H3318]] Empty [[H3318]] it piece [[H5409]] by piece; [[H5409]] cast [[H5307]] no [[H3808]] lots [[H1486]] for its contents. [[H5921]]

###### 7
For [[H3588]] the blood she shed [[H1818]] is [[H1961]] still within her; [[H8432]] she poured it out [[H7760]] on [[H5921]] the bare [[H6706]] rock; [[H5553]] she did not [[H3808]] pour [[H8210]] it on [[H5921]] the ground [[H776]] to cover [[H3680]] it with dust. [[H6083]]

###### 8
In order to stir up [[H5927]] wrath [[H2534]] and take vengeance, [[H5358]] I have placed [[H5414]] her blood [[H1818]] on [[H5921]] the bare [[H6706]] rock, [[H5553]] so that it would not [[H1115]] be covered.’ [[H3680]]

###### 9
Therefore [[H3651]] this is what [[H3541]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD [[H3068]] says: [[H559]] ‘Woe [[H188]] to the city [[H5892]] of bloodshed! [[H1818]] I, too, [[H589]] will pile the kindling [[H4071]] high. [[H1431]]

###### 10
Pile on [[H7235]] the logs [[H6086]] and kindle [[H1814]] the fire; [[H784]] cook [[H8552]] the meat well [[H1320]] and mix in [[H7543]] the spices; [[H4841]] let the bones [[H6106]] be burned. [[H2787]]

###### 11
Set [[H5975]] the empty [[H7386]] pot on [[H5921]] its coals [[H1513]] until [[H4616]] it becomes hot [[H3179]] and its copper [[H5178]] glows. [[H2787]] Then its impurity [[H2932]] will melt [[H5413]] within; [[H8432]] its rust [[H2457]] will be consumed. [[H8552]]

###### 12
It has frustrated [[H3811]] every effort; [[H8383]] its thick [[H7227]] rust [[H2457]] has not [[H3808]] been removed, [[H3318]] even by the fire. [[H784]]

###### 13
Because [[H3282]] of the indecency [[H2154]] of your uncleanness [[H2932]] I tried to cleanse you, [[H2891]] but you would not [[H3808]] be purified [[H2891]] from your filthiness. [[H2932]] You will not [[H3808]] be pure [[H2891]] again [[H5750]] until [[H5704]] My wrath [[H2534]] against you  has subsided. [[H5117]]

###### 14
I, [[H589]] the LORD, [[H3068]] have spoken; [[H1696]] [the time] is coming, [[H935]] and I will act. [[H6213]] I will not [[H3808]] refrain [[H6544]] [or] [[H3808]] show pity, [[H2347]] nor [[H3808]] will I relent. [[H5162]] I will judge you [[H8199]] according to your ways [[H1870]] and deeds,’ [[H5949]] declares [[H5002]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD.” [[H3069]]

###### 15
Then the word [[H1697]] of the LORD [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] to me, [[H413]] saying, [[H559]]

###### 16
“Son [[H1121]] of man, [[H120]] behold, [[H2005]] I am about to take away [[H3947]] the desire [[H4261]] of your eyes [[H5869]] with a fatal blow. [[H4046]] But you must not [[H3808]] lament [[H5594]] or weep [[H1058]] or let your tears [[H1832]] flow. [[H935]]

###### 17
Groan [[H602]] quietly; [[H1826]] do not [[H3808]] mourn [[H60]] for the dead. [[H4191]] Put [[H2280]] on [[H5921]] your turban [[H6287]] and strap [[H7760]] your sandals [[H5275]] on your feet; [[H7272]] do not [[H3808]] cover [[H5844]] [your] lips [[H8222]] or eat [[H398]] the bread [[H3899]] of mourners.” [[H376]]

###### 18
So I spoke [[H1696]] to [[H413]] the people [[H5971]] in the morning, [[H1242]] and in the evening [[H6153]] my wife [[H802]] died. [[H4191]] And the next morning [[H1242]] I did [[H6213]] as [[H834]] I had been commanded. [[H6680]]

###### 19
Then the people [[H5971]] asked me, [[H559]] “Won't [[H3808]] you tell [[H5046]] us  what [[H4100]] these [things] [[H428]] you [[H859]] are doing [[H6213]] mean to us?” 

###### 20
So I answered [[H559]] them, [[H413]] “The word [[H1697]] of the LORD [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] to me, [[H413]] saying: [[H559]]

###### 21
Tell [[H559]] the house [[H1004]] of Israel [[H3478]] that this is what [[H3541]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD [[H3069]] says: [[H559]] ‘I am about to desecrate [[H2490]] My sanctuary, [[H4720]] the pride [[H1347]] of your power, [[H5797]] the desire [[H4261]] of your eyes, [[H5869]] and the delight [[H4263]] of your soul. [[H5315]] And the sons [[H1121]] and daughters [[H1323]] you left behind [[H5800]] will fall [[H5307]] by the sword. [[H2719]]

###### 22
Then you will do [[H6213]] as [[H834]] I have done: [[H6213]] You will not [[H3808]] cover [[H5844]] [your] lips [[H8222]] or eat [[H398]] the bread [[H3899]] of mourners. [[H376]]

###### 23
Your turbans [[H6287]] will remain on [[H5921]] your heads [[H7218]] and your sandals [[H5275]] on your feet. [[H7272]] You will not [[H3808]] mourn [[H5594]] or [[H3808]] weep, [[H1058]] but you will waste away [[H4743]] because of your sins [[H5771]] and groan [[H5098]] among [[H413]] yourselves. [[H251]]

###### 24
Thus Ezekiel [[H3168]] will be [[H1961]] a sign [[H4159]] for you;  you will do [[H6213]] everything [[H3605]] that [[H834]] he has done. [[H6213]] When this happens, [[H935]] you will know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I [[H589]] am the Lord [[H136]] GOD.’ [[H3069]]

###### 25
And you, [[H859]] son [[H1121]] of man, [[H120]] know that on the day [[H3117]] I take [[H3947]] away [[H1992]] their stronghold, [[H4581]] their pride [[H8597]] and joy— [[H4885]] the desire [[H4261]] of their eyes, [[H5869]] on which they set [[H4853]] their minds— [[H5315]] and their sons [[H1121]] and daughters as well, [[H1323]]

###### 26
on that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] a fugitive [[H6412]] will come [[H935]] and tell you the news. [[H2045]]

###### 27
On that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] your mouth [[H6310]] will be opened [[H6605]] to him who has escaped; [[H6412]] you will speak [[H1696]] and no [[H3808]] longer [[H5750]] be mute. [[H481]] So you will be [[H1961]] a sign [[H4159]] for them,  and they will know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I [[H589]] am the LORD.” [[H3068]]
