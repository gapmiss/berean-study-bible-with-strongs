### 1
Then the word [[H1697]] of the LORD [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] to me, [[H413]] saying, [[H559]]

### 2
“Son [[H1121]] of man, [[H120]] set [[H7760]] your face [[H6440]] against [[H413]] the Ammonites [[H1121]] and prophesy [[H5012]] against them. [[H5921]]

### 3
Tell [[H559]] the Ammonites [[H1121]] to hear [[H8085]] the word [[H1697]] of the Lord [[H136]] GOD, [[H3069]] for this is what [[H3541]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD [[H3069]] says: [[H559]] ‘Because [[H3282]] you exclaimed, [[H559]] “Aha!” [[H1889]] when My sanctuary [[H4720]] was profaned, [[H2490]] when the land [[H127]] of Israel [[H3478]] was laid waste, [[H8074]] and [[H413]] when the house [[H1004]] of Judah [[H3063]] went [[H1980]] into exile, [[H1473]]

### 4
therefore [[H3651]] I will indeed [[H2005]] give you [[H5414]] as a possession [[H4181]] to the people [[H1121]] of the east. [[H6924]] They will set up [[H3427]] their encampments [[H2918]] and pitch [[H5414]] their tents among you. [[H4908]] They [[H1992]] will eat [[H398]] your fruit [[H6529]] and drink [[H8354]] your milk. [[H2461]]

### 5
I will make [[H5414]] Rabbah [[H7237]] a pasture [[H5116]] for camels, [[H1581]] and Ammon [[H1121]] a resting place for [[H4769]] sheep. [[H6629]] Then you will know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I [[H589]] am the LORD.’ [[H3068]]

### 6
For [[H3588]] this is what [[H3541]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD [[H3069]] says: [[H559]] ‘Because [[H3282]] you clapped [[H4222]] your hands, [[H3027]] and stomped [[H7554]] your feet [[H7272]] and rejoiced [[H8055]] over [[H413]] the land [[H127]] of Israel [[H3478]] with a heart [[H5315]] full [[H3605]] of contempt, [[H7589]]

### 7
therefore [[H3651]] I will indeed [[H2005]] stretch out [[H5186]] My hand [[H3027]] against you [[H5921]] and give you [[H5414]] as plunder [[H897]] to the nations. [[H1471]] I will cut you off [[H3772]] from [[H4480]] the peoples [[H5971]] and exterminate you [[H6]] from [[H4480]] the countries. [[H776]] I will destroy you, [[H8045]] and you will know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I [[H589]] am the LORD.’ [[H3068]]

### 8
This is what [[H3541]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD [[H3069]] says: [[H559]] ‘Because [[H3282]] Moab [[H4124]] and Seir [[H8165]] said, [[H559]] “Look, [[H2009]] the house [[H1004]] of Judah [[H3063]] is like all [[H3605]] the other nations,” [[H1471]]

### 9
therefore [[H3651]] I will indeed [[H2005]] expose [[H6605]] the flank [[H3802]] of Moab [[H4124]] beginning with its frontier [[H7097]] cities— [[H5892]] Beth-jeshimoth, [[H1020]] Baal-meon, [[H1186]] and Kiriathaim— [[H7156]] the glory [[H6643]] of the land. [[H776]]

### 10
I will give it [[H5414]] along with [[H5921]] the Ammonites [[H5983]] as a possession [[H4181]] to the people [[H1121]] of the East, [[H6924]] so that [[H4616]] the Ammonites [[H5983]] will no longer [[H3808]] be remembered [[H2142]] among the nations. [[H1471]]

### 11
So I will execute [[H6213]] judgments [[H8201]] on Moab, [[H4124]] and they will know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I [[H589]] am the LORD.’ [[H3068]]

### 12
This is what [[H3541]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD [[H3069]] says: [[H559]] ‘Because [[H3282]] Edom [[H123]] acted [[H6213]] vengefully [[H5358]] against the house [[H1004]] of Judah [[H3063]] and in [so doing] [[H5358]] incurred grievous guilt, [[H816]]

### 13
therefore [[H3651]] this is what [[H3541]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD [[H3069]] says: [[H559]] I will stretch out [[H5186]] My hand [[H3027]] against [[H5921]] Edom [[H123]] and cut off [[H3772]] from it [[H4480]] both man [[H120]] and beast. [[H929]] I will make [[H5414]] it a wasteland, [[H2723]] and from Teman [[H8487]] to Dedan [[H1719]] they will fall [[H5307]] by the sword. [[H2719]]

### 14
I will take [[H5414]] My vengeance [[H5360]] on Edom [[H123]] by the hand [[H3027]] of My people [[H5971]] Israel, [[H3478]] and they will deal [[H6213]] with Edom [[H123]] according to My anger [[H639]] and wrath. [[H2534]] Then they will know [[H3045]] My vengeance, [[H5360]] declares [[H5002]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD.’ [[H3068]]

### 15
This is what [[H3541]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD [[H3069]] says: [[H559]] ‘Because [[H3282]] the Philistines [[H6430]] acted [[H6213]] in vengeance [[H5360]] and took revenge [[H5358]] with contempt [[H7589]] of heart, [[H5315]] to destroy [Judah] [[H4889]] with ancient [[H5769]] hostility, [[H342]]

### 16
therefore [[H3651]] this is what [[H3541]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD [[H3069]] says: [[H559]] Behold, [[H2005]] I will stretch out [[H5186]] My hand [[H3027]] against [[H5921]] the Philistines, [[H6430]] and I will cut off [[H3772]] the Cherethites [[H3774]] and destroy [[H6]] the remnant [[H7611]] along [[H2348]] the coast. [[H3220]]

### 17
I will execute [[H6213]] great [[H1419]] vengeance [[H5360]] against them  with furious [[H2534]] reproof, [[H8433]] and they will know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I [[H589]] am the LORD [[H3068]] when I take [[H5414]] My vengeance [[H5360]] upon them.’”
