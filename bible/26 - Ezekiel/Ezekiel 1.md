### 1
In the thirtieth [[H7970]] year, [[H8141]] in the fourth month, [[H7243]] on the fifth [[H2568]] day, [[H2320]] while I [[H589]] was among [[H8432]] the exiles [[H1473]] by [[H5921]] the River [[H5104]] Kebar, [[H3529]] the heavens [[H8064]] opened [[H6605]] and I saw [[H7200]] visions [[H4759]] of God. [[H430]]

### 2
On the fifth [[H2568]] day of the month— [[H2320]] it [[H1931]] was the fifth [[H2549]] year [[H8141]] of the exile [[H1546]] of King [[H4428]] Jehoiachin— [[H3112]]

### 3
the word [[H1697]] of the LORD [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] directly [[H1961]] to [[H413]] Ezekiel [[H3168]] the priest, [[H3548]] the son [[H1121]] of Buzi, [[H941]] in the land [[H776]] of the Chaldeans [[H3778]] by [[H5921]] the Kebar [[H3529]] River. [[H5104]] And there [[H8033]] the LORD’s [[H3068]] hand [[H3027]] was [[H1961]] upon him. [[H5921]]

### 4
I looked [[H7200]] and saw [[H2009]] a whirlwind [[H7307]] coming [[H935]] from [[H4480]] the north, [[H6828]] a great [[H1419]] cloud [[H6051]] with fire [[H784]] flashing back and forth [[H3947]] and brilliant light [[H5051]] all around it. [[H5439]] In the center [[H8432]] of the fire [[H784]] was a glow [[H5869]] like amber, [[H2830]]

### 5
and within it [[H8432]] [was] the form [[H1823]] of four [[H702]] living creatures. [[H2416]] And this [was] [[H2088]] their appearance: [[H4758]] They had [[H2007]] a human [[H120]] form, [[H1823]]

### 6
but each [[H259]] had four [[H702]] faces [[H6440]] and four [[H702]] wings. [[H3671]]

### 7
Their legs [[H7272]] were straight, [[H3477]] and the soles [[H3709]] of their feet [[H7272]] were like the hooves [[H3709]] of a calf, [[H5695]] gleaming [[H5340]] like [[H5869]] polished [[H7044]] bronze. [[H5178]]

### 8
Under [[H8478]] their wings [[H3671]] on [[H5921]] their four [[H702]] sides [[H7253]] they had human [[H120]] hands. [[H3027]] All four [[H702]] of them had faces [[H6440]] and wings, [[H3671]]

### 9
and their wings [[H3671]] were touching [[H2266]] one [[H413]] another. [[H269]] They did not [[H3808]] turn [[H5437]] as they moved; [[H1980]] each [[H376]] one went [[H1980]] straight [[H5676]] ahead. [[H6440]]

### 10
The form [[H1823]] of their faces [[H6440]] was that [[H6440]] of a man, [[H120]] and each of the four [[H702]] had the face [[H6440]] of a lion [[H738]] on [[H413]] the right side, [[H3225]] the face [[H6440]] of an ox [[H7794]] on the left side, [[H8040]] and also [[H702]] the face [[H6440]] of an eagle. [[H5404]]

### 11
Such were their faces. [[H6440]] Their wings [[H3671]] were spread [[H6504]] upward; [[H4605]] each [had] [[H376]] two [wings] [[H8147]] touching [[H2266]] the wings of the creature on either side, [[H376]] and two [[H8147]] wings covering [[H3680]] its [[H853]] body. [[H1472]]

### 12
Each [[H376]] [creature] went [[H1980]] straight ahead. [[H413]] Wherever [[H413]] the spirit [[H7307]] would go, [[H1980]] they would go, [[H1980]] without [[H3808]] turning [[H5437]] as they moved. [[H1980]]

### 13
In the midst [[H1823]] of the living creatures [[H2416]] was the appearance [[H4758]] of glowing [[H784]] coals [[H1513]] of fire, [[H1197]] [or] [[H4758]] of torches. [[H3940]] Fire [[H784]] moved back and forth [[H1980]] between [[H996]] the living creatures; [[H2416]] it was bright, [[H5051]] and lightning [[H1300]] flashed [[H3318]] out of [[H4480]] it. [[H784]]

### 14
The creatures [[H2416]] were darting back and forth [[H7519]] as quickly as [[H4758]] flashes of lightning. [[H965]]

### 15
When I looked [[H7200]] at the living creatures, [[H2416]] I saw [[H2009]] a [[H259]] wheel [[H212]] on the ground [[H776]] beside [[H681]] each creature [[H2416]] with its four [[H702]] faces. [[H6440]]

### 16
The workmanship [[H4639]] of the wheels [[H212]] looked like [[H4758]] the gleam [[H5869]] of beryl, [[H8658]] and all four [[H702]] had the same [[H259]] likeness. [[H1823]] Their workmanship [[H4639]] looked [[H4758]] like [[H834]] a wheel [[H212]] within [[H8432]] a wheel. [[H212]]

### 17
As they moved, [[H1980]] they went [[H1980]] in [[H5921]] any of the four [[H702]] directions, [[H7253]] without [[H3808]] pivoting [[H5437]] as they moved. [[H1980]]

### 18
Their rims [[H1354]] were high [[H1363]] and awesome, [[H3374]] and all four [[H702]] rims [[H1354]] were full of [[H4392]] eyes [[H5869]] all around. [[H5439]]

### 19
So as the living creatures [[H2416]] moved, [[H1980]] the wheels [[H212]] moved [[H1980]] beside them, [[H681]] and when the creatures [[H2416]] rose [[H5375]] from [[H5921]] the ground, [[H776]] the wheels [[H212]] also rose. [[H5375]]

### 20
Wherever [[H5921]] the spirit [[H7307]] would go, [[H1980]] they would go, [[H1980]] and the wheels [[H212]] would rise [[H5375]] alongside them, [[H5980]] because [[H3588]] the spirit [[H7307]] of the living creatures [[H2416]] was in the wheels. [[H212]]

### 21
When the creatures moved, [[H1980]] the wheels moved; [[H1980]] when the creatures stood still, [[H5975]] the wheels stood still; [[H5975]] and when the creatures rose [[H5375]] from [[H5921]] the ground, [[H776]] the wheels [[H212]] rose [[H5375]] alongside them, [[H5980]] because [[H3588]] the spirit [[H7307]] of the living creatures [[H2416]] was in the wheels. [[H212]]

### 22
Spread out [[H5186]] above [[H5921]] the heads [[H7218]] of the living creatures [[H2416]] [was] the shape [[H1823]] on an awesome [[H3372]] expanse, [[H7549]] gleaming [[H5869]] like crystal. [[H7140]]

### 23
And under [[H8478]] the expanse, [[H7549]] their wings [[H3671]] stretched out [[H3477]] toward [[H413]] one [[H802]] another. [[H269]] Each one [[H376]] also had two [[H8147]] wings covering [[H3680]] its body. [[H1472]]

### 24
When [the creatures] moved, [[H1980]] I heard [[H8085]] the sound [[H6963]] of their wings [[H3671]] like the roar [[H6963]] of many [[H7227]] waters, [[H4325]] like the voice [[H6963]] of the Almighty, [[H7706]] like [[H6963]] the tumult [[H1999]] of an army. [[H4264]] When they stood still, [[H5975]] they lowered [[H7503]] their wings. [[H3671]]

### 25
And as they stood still [[H5975]] with their wings [[H3671]] lowered, [[H7503]] a voice [[H6963]] came [[H1961]] from above [[H5921]] the expanse [[H7549]] that [was] [[H834]] over [[H5921]] their heads. [[H7218]]

### 26
Above [[H4605]] the expanse [[H7549]] over [[H5921]] their heads [[H7218]] [was] [[H834]] the likeness [[H1823]] of a throne [[H3678]] with the appearance [[H4758]] of sapphire, [[H5601]] [and] on the throne [[H3678]] high above [[H5921]] was a figure [[H1823]] like that [[H4758]] of a man. [[H120]]

### 27
From what seemed [[H4758]] to be His waist [[H4975]] up, [[H4605]] I saw [[H7200]] a gleam [[H5869]] like amber, [[H2830]] with what looked [[H4758]] like fire [[H784]] within [[H1004]] it  all around. [[H5439]] And from what seemed [[H4758]] to be His waist [[H4975]] down, [[H4295]] I saw [[H7200]] what looked [[H4758]] like fire; [[H784]] and brilliant light [[H5051]] surrounded Him. [[H5439]]

### 28
The appearance [[H4758]] of the brilliant light [[H5051]] all around Him [[H5439]] was like that [[H4758]] of a rainbow [[H7198]] in a cloud [[H6051]] on a rainy [[H1653]] day. [[H3117]] This [[H1931]] was the appearance [[H4758]] of the likeness [[H1823]] of the glory [[H3519]] of the LORD. [[H3068]] And when I saw it, [[H7200]] I fell [[H5307]] facedown [[H5921]] and heard [[H8085]] a voice [[H6963]] speaking. [[H1696]]
