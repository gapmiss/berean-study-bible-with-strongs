###### 1
And the word [[H1697]] of the LORD [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] to me, [[H413]] saying, [[H559]]

###### 2
“Son [[H1121]] of man, [[H120]] set [[H7760]] your face [[H6440]] against [[H413]] Gog, [[H1463]] of the land [[H776]] of Magog, [[H4031]] the chief [[H7218]] prince [[H5387]] of Meshech [[H4902]] and Tubal. [[H8422]] Prophesy [[H5012]] against him [[H5921]]

###### 3
and declare [[H559]] that this is what [[H3541]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD [[H3069]] says: [[H559]] ‘Behold, [[H2005]] I am against you, [[H413]] O Gog, [[H1463]] chief [[H7218]] prince [[H5387]] of Meshech [[H4902]] and Tubal. [[H8422]]

###### 4
I will turn you around, [[H7725]] put [[H5414]] hooks [[H2397]] in your jaws, [[H3895]] and bring you out [[H3318]] with all [[H3605]] your army— [[H2428]] your horses, [[H5483]] your horsemen [[H6571]] in full [[H3605]] armor, [[H3847]] a huge [[H7227]] company [[H6951]] armed with shields [[H6793]] and bucklers, [[H4043]] all [[H3605]] brandishing [[H8610]] their swords. [[H2719]]

###### 5
Persia, [[H6539]] Cush, [[H3568]] and Put [[H6316]] will accompany them, [[H854]] all [[H3605]] with shields [[H4043]] and helmets; [[H3553]]

###### 6
Gomer [[H1586]] with all [[H3605]] its troops; [[H102]] and Beth-togarmah [[H1004]] from the far [[H3411]] north [[H6828]] with all [[H3605]] its troops— [[H102]] many [[H7227]] nations [[H5971]] with you. [[H854]]

###### 7
Get ready; [[H3559]] prepare [[H3559]] yourself,  you [[H859]] and all [[H3605]] your company [[H6951]] gathered [[H6950]] around you; [[H5921]] you will be [[H1961]] their guard. [[H4929]]

###### 8
After a long [[H7227]] time [[H3117]] you will be summoned. [[H6485]] In the last [[H319]] years [[H8141]] you will enter [[H935]] a land [[H776]] brought back [[H7725]] from war [[H2719]] and regathered [[H6908]] from many [[H7227]] peoples [[H5971]] to [[H5921]] the mountains [[H2022]] of Israel, [[H3478]] which [[H834]] had long [[H8548]] been [[H1961]] desolate. [[H2723]] They [[H1931]] had been brought out [[H3318]] from the nations, [[H5971]] and all [[H3605]] now dwell [[H3427]] securely. [[H983]]

###### 9
You [[H859]] and all [[H3605]] your troops, [[H102]] and many [[H7227]] peoples [[H5971]] with you [[H854]] will go up, [[H5927]] advancing [[H935]] like a thunderstorm; [[H7722]] you will be [[H1961]] like a cloud [[H6051]] covering [[H3680]] the land.’ [[H776]]

###### 10
This is what [[H3541]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD [[H3068]] says: [[H559]] ‘On that [[H1931]] day, [[H3117]] thoughts [[H1697]] will arise [[H5927]] in [[H5921]] your mind, [[H3824]] and you will devise [[H2803]] an evil [[H7451]] plan. [[H4284]]

###### 11
You will say, [[H559]] “I will go up [[H5927]] against [[H5921]] a land [[H776]] of unwalled villages; [[H6519]] I will come against [[H935]] a tranquil people [[H8252]] who dwell [[H3427]] securely, [[H983]] all [[H3605]] of them living [[H3427]] without [[H369]] walls [[H2346]] [or] [[H369]] bars [[H1280]] or gates— [[H1817]]

###### 12
in order to seize [[H7997]] the spoil [[H7998]] and carry off the plunder, [[H962]] to turn [[H7725]] a hand [[H3027]] against [[H5921]] the desolate places [[H2723]] now inhabited [[H3427]] and against [[H413]] a people [[H5971]] gathered [[H622]] from the nations, [[H1471]] who have acquired [[H6213]] livestock [[H4735]] and possessions [[H7075]] and who live [[H3427]] at [[H5921]] the center [[H2872]] of the land.” [[H776]]

###### 13
Sheba [[H7614]] and Dedan [[H1719]] and the merchants [[H5503]] of Tarshish [[H8659]] with all [[H3605]] its villages [[H3715]] will ask [[H559]] you,  “Have you [[H859]] come [[H935]] to capture [[H7997]] spoil? [[H7998]] Have you assembled [[H6950]] your hordes [[H6951]] to carry off plunder, [[H962]] to make off [[H5375]] with silver [[H3701]] and gold, [[H2091]] to take [[H3947]] cattle [[H4735]] and goods, [[H7075]] to seize [[H7997]] great [[H1419]] spoil? [[H7998]]

###### 14
Therefore [[H3651]] prophesy, [[H5012]] son [[H1121]] of man, [[H120]] and tell [[H559]] Gog [[H1463]] that this is what [[H3541]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD [[H3069]] says: [[H559]] ‘On that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] when My people [[H5971]] Israel [[H3478]] are dwelling [[H3427]] securely, [[H983]] will you not [[H3808]] take notice of this? [[H3045]]

###### 15
And you will come [[H935]] from your place [[H4725]] out of the far [[H3411]] north— [[H6828]] you [[H859]] and many [[H7227]] peoples [[H5971]] with you, [[H854]] all [[H3605]] riding [[H7392]] horses— [[H5483]] a mighty [[H1419]] horde, [[H6951]] a huge [[H7227]] army. [[H2428]]

###### 16
You will advance [[H5927]] against [[H5921]] My people [[H5971]] Israel [[H3478]] like a cloud [[H6051]] covering [[H3680]] the land. [[H776]] It will happen [[H1961]] in the last [[H319]] days, [[H3117]] O Gog, [[H1463]] that I will bring you [[H935]] against [[H5921]] My land, [[H776]] so that [[H4616]] the nations [[H1471]] may know [[H3045]] Me [[H853]] when I show Myself holy [[H6942]] in you  before their eyes. [[H5869]]

###### 17
This is what [[H3541]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD [[H3069]] says: [[H559]] ‘Are you [[H859]] the one [[H1931]] of whom [[H834]] I have spoken [[H1696]] in former [[H6931]] days [[H3117]] through [[H3027]] My servants, [[H5650]] the prophets [[H5030]] of Israel, [[H3478]] who for years [[H8141]] prophesied [[H5012]] in those [[H1992]] times [[H3117]] that I would bring [[H935]] you [[H853]] against them? [[H5921]]

###### 18
Now [[H1961]] on that [[H1931]] day, [[H3117]] the day [[H3117]] when Gog [[H1463]] comes [[H935]] against [[H5921]] the land [[H127]] of Israel, [[H3478]] declares [[H5002]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD, [[H3069]] My wrath [[H2534]] will flare up. [[H5927]]

###### 19
In My zeal [[H7068]] and fiery [[H784]] rage [[H5678]] I proclaim [[H1696]] that on that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] there will be [[H1961]] a great [[H1419]] earthquake [[H7494]] in [[H5921]] the land [[H127]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

###### 20
The fish [[H1709]] of the sea, [[H3220]] the birds [[H5775]] of the air, [[H8064]] the beasts [[H2416]] of the field, [[H7704]] every [[H3605]] creature [[H7431]] that crawls [[H7430]] upon [[H5921]] the ground, [[H127]] and all [[H3605]] mankind [[H120]] on [[H5921]] the face [[H6440]] of the earth [[H127]] will tremble [[H7493]] at My presence. [[H6440]] The mountains [[H2022]] will be thrown down, [[H2040]] the cliffs [[H4095]] will collapse, [[H5307]] and every [[H3605]] wall [[H2346]] will fall [[H5307]] to the ground. [[H776]]

###### 21
And I will summon [[H7121]] a sword [[H2719]] against Gog [[H5921]] on all [[H3605]] My mountains, [[H2022]] declares [[H5002]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD, [[H3069]] and every man’s [[H376]] sword [[H2719]] will be [[H1961]] against his brother. [[H251]]

###### 22
I will execute judgment [[H8199]] upon him [[H854]] with plague [[H1698]] and bloodshed. [[H1818]] I will pour out [[H4305]] torrents [[H7857]] of rain, [[H1653]] hailstones, [[H68]] fire, [[H784]] and brimstone [[H1614]] on him [[H5921]] and on [[H5921]] his troops [[H102]] and on [[H5921]] the many [[H7227]] nations [[H5971]] with him. [[H834]]

###### 23
I will magnify [[H1431]] and sanctify Myself, [[H6942]] and will reveal Myself [[H3045]] in the sight [[H5869]] of many [[H7227]] nations. [[H1471]] Then they will know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I [[H589]] am the LORD.’ [[H3068]]
