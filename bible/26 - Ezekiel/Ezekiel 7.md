###### 1
And the word [[H1697]] of the LORD [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] to me, [[H413]] saying, [[H559]]

###### 2
“O [[H859]] son [[H1121]] of man, [[H120]] this is what [[H3541]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD [[H3069]] says [[H559]] to the land [[H127]] of Israel: [[H3478]] ‘The end! [[H7093]] The end [[H7093]] has come [[H935]] upon [[H5921]] the four [[H702]] corners [[H3671]] of the land. [[H776]]

###### 3
The end [[H7093]] is now [[H6258]] upon you, [[H5921]] and I will unleash [[H7971]] My anger against you; [[H639]] I will judge you [[H8199]] according to your ways [[H1870]] and repay [[H5414]] you [[H5921]] for all [[H3605]] your abominations. [[H8441]]

###### 4
I will not [[H3808]] look on you [[H5921]] with pity, [[H2347]] nor [[H3808]] will I spare you, [[H2550]] but I will punish you for [[H3588]] your ways [[H1870]] and for the abominations [[H8441]] among you. [[H8432]] Then you will know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I [[H589]] am the LORD.’ [[H3068]]

###### 5
This is what [[H3541]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD [[H3068]] says: [[H559]] ‘Disaster! [[H7451]] An unprecedented [[H259]] disaster— [[H7451]] behold, [[H2009]] it is coming! [[H935]]

###### 6
The end [[H7093]] has come! [[H935]] The end [[H7093]] has come! [[H935]] It has roused itself [[H6974]] against you. [[H413]] Behold, [[H2009]] it has come! [[H935]]

###### 7
Doom [[H6843]] has come [[H935]] to you, [[H413]] O inhabitants [[H3427]] of the land. [[H776]] The time [[H6256]] has come; [[H935]] the day [[H3117]] is near; [[H7138]] there is panic [[H4103]] on the mountains [[H2022]] instead of shouts of joy. [[H3808]]

###### 8
Very soon [[H7138]] I will pour out [[H8210]] My wrath [[H2534]] upon you [[H5921]] and vent [[H3615]] My anger [[H639]] against you;  I will judge you [[H8199]] according to your ways [[H1870]] and punish you [[H5414]] for all [[H3605]] your abominations. [[H8441]]

###### 9
I will not [[H3808]] look on you with pity, [[H2347]] nor [[H3808]] will I spare you, [[H2550]] but I will punish you [[H5414]] for your ways [[H1870]] and for the abominations [[H8441]] among you. [[H8432]] Then you will know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] it is I, [[H589]] the LORD, [[H3068]] who strikes the blow. [[H5221]]

###### 10
Behold, [[H2009]] the day [[H3117]] is here! [[H2009]] It has come! [[H935]] Doom [[H6843]] has gone out, [[H3318]] the rod [[H4294]] has budded, [[H6524]] arrogance [[H2087]] has bloomed. [[H6692]]

###### 11
Their violence [[H2555]] has grown [[H6965]] into a rod [[H4294]] [to punish their] wickedness. [[H7562]] None [[H3808]] of them [will remain]: [[H1992]] none [[H3808]] of their multitude, [[H1995]] none [[H3808]] of their wealth, [[H1991]] and nothing [[H3808]] of value. [[H5089]]

###### 12
The time [[H6256]] has come; [[H935]] the day [[H3117]] has arrived. [[H5060]] Let the buyer [[H7069]] not [[H408]] rejoice [[H8055]] and the seller [[H4376]] not [[H408]] mourn, [[H56]] for [[H3588]] wrath [[H2740]] is upon [[H413]] all [[H3605]] their multitudes. [[H1995]]

###### 13
The seller [[H4376]] will surely [[H3588]] not [[H3808]] recover [[H7725]] what he sold [[H4465]] as long as [[H5750]] both remain alive. [[H2416]] For [[H3588]] the vision [[H2377]] concerning [[H413]] the whole [[H3605]] multitude [[H1995]] will not [[H3808]] be revoked, [[H7725]] and because of their iniquity, [[H5771]] not one [[H376]] will preserve [[H2388]] his life. [[H2416]]

###### 14
They have blown [[H8628]] the trumpet [[H8619]] and made [[H3559]] everything ready, [[H3605]] but no [[H369]] one goes [[H1980]] to war, [[H4421]] for [[H3588]] My wrath [[H2740]] is upon [[H413]] the whole [[H3605]] multitude. [[H1995]]

###### 15
The sword [[H2719]] is outside; [[H2351]] plague [[H1698]] and famine [[H7458]] are within. [[H1004]] Those [[H834]] in the country [[H7704]] will die [[H4191]] by the sword, [[H2719]] and those [[H834]] in the city [[H5892]] will be devoured [[H398]] by famine [[H7458]] and plague. [[H1698]]

###### 16
The survivors [[H6412]] will escape [[H6403]] and live in [[H413]] the mountains, [[H2022]] all [[H3605]] moaning [[H1993]] like doves [[H3123]] of the valley, [[H1516]] each [[H376]] for his own iniquity. [[H5771]]

###### 17
Every [[H3605]] hand [[H3027]] will go limp, [[H7503]] and every [[H3605]] knee [[H1290]] will turn to [[H1980]] water. [[H4325]]

###### 18
They will put on [[H2296]] sackcloth, [[H8242]] and terror [[H6427]] will overwhelm them. [[H3680]] Shame [[H955]] will cover all [[H3605]] their faces, [[H6440]] and all [[H3605]] their heads [[H7218]] will be shaved. [[H7144]]

###### 19
They will throw [[H7993]] their silver [[H3701]] into the streets, [[H2351]] and their gold [[H2091]] will seem [[H1961]] unclean. [[H5079]] Their silver [[H3701]] and gold [[H2091]] cannot [[H3808]] save them [[H5337]] in the day [[H3117]] of the wrath [[H5678]] of the LORD. [[H3068]] They cannot [[H3808]] satisfy [[H7646]] their appetites [[H5315]] or fill [[H4390]] their stomachs with [wealth], [[H4578]] for [[H3588]] it became [[H1961]] the stumbling block [[H4383]] that brought their iniquity. [[H5771]]

###### 20
His beautiful [[H6643]] ornaments [[H5716]] they transformed [[H7760]] into pride [[H1347]] and used them  to fashion [[H6213]] their vile [[H8441]] images [[H6754]] and detestable idols. [[H8251]] Therefore [[H5921]] I will make these [[H5414]] into something unclean for them. [[H5079]]

###### 21
And I will hand these things over [[H5414]] as plunder [[H957]] to foreigners [[H2114]] and as loot [[H7998]] to the wicked [[H7563]] of the earth, [[H776]] who will defile them. [[H2490]]

###### 22
I will turn [[H5437]] My face [[H6440]] away from them, [[H1992]] as they defile [[H2490]] My treasured place. [[H6845]] Violent men [[H6530]] will enter it [[H935]] and they will defile it. [[H2490]]

###### 23
Forge [[H6213]] the chain, [[H7569]] for [[H3588]] the land [[H776]] is full [[H4390]] of crimes [[H4941]] of bloodshed, [[H1818]] and the city [[H5892]] is full [[H4390]] of violence. [[H2555]]

###### 24
So I will bring [[H935]] the most wicked [[H7451]] of nations [[H1471]] to take possession of [[H3423]] their houses. [[H1004]] I will end [[H7673]] the pride [[H1347]] of the mighty, [[H5794]] and their holy places [[H6942]] will be profaned. [[H2490]]

###### 25
Anguish [[H7089]] is coming! [[H935]] They will seek [[H1245]] peace, [[H7965]] but find none. [[H369]]

###### 26
Disaster [[H1943]] upon [[H5921]] disaster [[H1943]] will come, [[H935]] and [[H1961]] rumor [[H8052]] after [[H413]] rumor. [[H8052]] Then they will seek [[H1245]] a vision [[H2377]] from a prophet, [[H5030]] but instruction [[H8451]] from the priests [[H3548]] and counsel [[H6098]] from the ancients [[H2205]] will perish. [[H6]]

###### 27
The king [[H4428]] will mourn, [[H56]] the prince [[H5387]] will be clothed [[H3847]] with despair, [[H8077]] and the hands [[H3027]] of the people [[H5971]] of the land [[H776]] will tremble. [[H926]] I will deal [[H6213]] with them [[H853]] according to their conduct, [[H1870]] and I will judge them [[H8199]] by their own standards. [[H4941]] Then they will know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I [[H589]] am the LORD.’” [[H3068]]
