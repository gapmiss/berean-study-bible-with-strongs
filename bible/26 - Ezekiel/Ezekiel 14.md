### 1
Then some of the elders [[H2205]] of Israel [[H3478]] came [[H935]] and sat down [[H3427]] before [[H6440]] me. 

### 2
And the word [[H1697]] of the LORD [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] to me, [[H413]] saying, [[H559]]

### 3
“Son [[H1121]] of man, [[H120]] these [[H428]] men [[H376]] have set up [[H5927]] idols [[H1544]] in [[H5921]] their hearts [[H3820]] and put [[H5414]] wicked [[H5771]] stumbling blocks [[H4383]] before [[H5227]] their faces. [[H6440]] Should I consult with them [[H1875]] in any way? [[H1875]]

### 4
Therefore, [[H3651]] speak [[H1696]] to them [[H853]] and tell them [[H559]] that this is what [[H3541]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD [[H3069]] says: [[H559]] ‘When [[H834]] any [[H376]] Israelite [[H3478]] sets up [[H5927]] idols [[H1544]] in [[H413]] his heart [[H3820]] and puts [[H7760]] a wicked [[H5771]] stumbling block [[H4383]] before [[H5227]] his face, [[H6440]] and then comes [[H935]] to [[H413]] the prophet, [[H5030]] I [[H589]] the LORD [[H3068]] will answer him [[H6030]] according to his great [[H7230]] idolatry, [[H1544]]

### 5
so that [[H4616]] I may take hold [[H8610]] of the hearts [[H3820]] of the [people] [[H1004]] of Israel. [[H3478]] For [[H834]] because of their idols, [[H1544]] they are all [[H3605]] estranged [[H2114]] from Me.’ [[H5921]]

### 6
Therefore [[H3651]] tell [[H559]] the house [[H1004]] of Israel [[H3478]] that this is what [[H3541]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD [[H3069]] says: [[H559]] ‘Repent [[H7725]] and turn away [[H7725]] from [[H5921]] your idols; [[H1544]] turn your faces [[H6440]] away [[H7725]] from [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] your abominations. [[H8441]]

### 7
For when [[H3588]] any [[H376]] Israelite [[H3478]] or any foreigner [[H1616]] dwelling [[H1481]] in Israel [[H3478]] separates himself [[H5144]] from Me, [[H310]] sets up [[H5927]] idols [[H1544]] in [[H413]] his heart, [[H3820]] and puts [[H7760]] a wicked [[H5771]] stumbling block [[H4383]] before [[H5227]] his face, [[H6440]] and then comes [[H935]] to [[H413]] the prophet [[H5030]] to inquire of Me, [[H1875]] I [[H589]] the LORD [[H3068]] will answer [[H6030]] him  Myself. 

### 8
I will set [[H5414]] My face [[H6440]] against that [[H1931]] man [[H376]] and make [[H8074]] him a sign [[H226]] and a proverb; [[H4912]] I will cut him off [[H3772]] from among [[H8432]] My people. [[H5971]] Then you will know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I [[H589]] am the LORD. [[H3068]]

### 9
But if [[H3588]] the prophet [[H5030]] is enticed [[H6601]] to speak [[H1696]] a message, [[H1697]] then it was I [[H589]] the LORD [[H3068]] who enticed [[H6601]] him, [[H1931]] and I will stretch out [[H5186]] My hand [[H3027]] against him [[H5921]] and destroy him [[H8045]] from among [[H8432]] My people [[H5971]] Israel. [[H3478]]

### 10
They will bear [[H5375]] their punishment— [[H5771]] the punishment [[H5771]] of the inquirer [[H1875]] will be [[H1961]] the same as that [[H5771]] of the prophet— [[H5030]]

### 11
in order that [[H4616]] the house [[H1004]] of Israel [[H3478]] may no [[H3808]] longer [[H5750]] stray [[H8582]] from Me [[H310]] and no [[H3808]] longer [[H5750]] defile themselves [[H2930]] with all [[H3605]] their transgressions. [[H6588]] Then they will be [[H1961]] My people [[H5971]] and I [[H589]] will be [[H1961]] their God, [[H430]] declares [[H5002]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD.’” [[H3069]]

### 12
And the word [[H1697]] of the LORD [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] to me, [[H413]] saying, [[H559]]

### 13
“Son [[H1121]] of man, [[H120]] if [[H3588]] a land [[H776]] sins [[H2398]] against Me  by acting unfaithfully, [[H4603]] and I stretch out [[H5186]] My hand [[H3027]] against it [[H5921]] to cut off [[H7665]] its supply [[H4294]] of bread, [[H3899]] to send [[H7971]] famine through it, [[H7458]] and to cut off [[H3772]] from it [[H4480]] both man [[H120]] and beast, [[H929]]

### 14
then even if these [[H428]] three [[H7969]] men— [[H582]] Noah, [[H5146]] Daniel, [[H1840]] and Job— [[H347]] were [[H1961]] in it, [[H8432]] their righteousness [[H6666]] could deliver [[H5337]] only themselves, [[H5315]] declares [[H5002]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD. [[H3068]]

### 15
Or if [[H3863]] I send wild [[H7451]] beasts [[H2416]] through the land [[H776]] and they bereave it [[H7921]] so that it becomes [[H1961]] desolate, [[H8077]] with no man [[H1097]] passing through [[H5674]] for fear [[H6440]] of the beasts, [[H2416]]

### 16
then as surely [[H589]] as I live, [[H2416]] declares [[H5002]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD, [[H3069]] even if these [[H428]] three [[H7969]] men [[H376]] were in it, [[H8432]] they could not [[H518]] deliver [[H5337]] their own sons [[H1121]] or [[H518]] daughters. [[H1323]] They [[H1992]] alone [[H905]] would be saved, [[H5337]] but the land [[H776]] would be [[H1961]] desolate. [[H8077]]

### 17
Or [[H176]] if I bring [[H935]] a sword [[H2719]] against [[H5921]] that [[H1931]] land [[H776]] and say, [[H559]] ‘Let a sword [[H2719]] pass [[H5674]] through it,’ [[H776]] so that I cut off [[H3772]] from it [[H4480]] both man [[H120]] and beast, [[H929]]

### 18
then as surely [[H589]] as I live, [[H2416]] declares [[H5002]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD, [[H3069]] even if these [[H428]] three [[H7969]] men [[H376]] were in it, [[H8432]] they could not [[H3808]] deliver [[H5337]] their sons [[H1121]] or daughters; [[H1323]] they [[H1992]] alone [[H905]] would be saved. [[H5337]]

### 19
Or [[H176]] if I send [[H7971]] a plague [[H1698]] into [[H413]] that [[H1931]] land [[H776]] and pour out [[H8210]] My wrath [[H2534]] upon it [[H5921]] through bloodshed, [[H1818]] cutting off [[H3772]] from it [[H4480]] both man [[H120]] and beast, [[H929]]

### 20
then as surely [[H589]] as I live, [[H2416]] declares [[H5002]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD, [[H3069]] even if Noah, [[H5146]] Daniel, [[H1840]] and Job [[H347]] were in it, [[H8432]] they could deliver [[H5337]] neither [[H518]] son [[H1121]] nor [[H518]] daughter. [[H1323]] Their righteousness [[H6666]] could save [[H5337]] only themselves. [[H5315]]

### 21
For [[H3588]] this is what [[H3541]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD [[H3069]] says: [[H559]] ‘How much worse [[H637]] will it be when [[H3588]] I send [[H7971]] against [[H413]] Jerusalem [[H3389]] My four [[H702]] dire [[H7451]] judgments— [[H8201]] sword, [[H2719]] famine, [[H7458]] wild [[H7451]] beasts, [[H2416]] and plague— [[H1698]] in order to cut off [[H3772]] from it [[H4480]] both man [[H120]] and beast? [[H929]]

### 22
Yet, behold, [[H2009]] some survivors [[H6413]] will be left in it— [[H3498]] sons [[H1121]] and daughters [[H1323]] who will be brought out. [[H3318]] They will come out [[H3318]] to you, [[H413]] and when you see [[H7200]] their conduct [[H1870]] and actions, [[H5949]] you will be consoled [[H5162]] regarding [[H5921]] the disaster [[H7451]] I have brought [[H935]] upon [[H5921]] Jerusalem— [[H3389]] everything [[H3605]] that [[H834]] I have brought [[H935]] upon it. [[H5921]]

### 23
They will bring you consolation [[H5162]] when [[H3588]] you see [[H7200]] their conduct [[H1870]] and actions, [[H5949]] and you will know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] it was not [[H3808]] without cause [[H2600]] that I have done [[H6213]] all [[H3605]] [these things] [[H834]] within it,  declares [[H5002]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD.’” [[H3069]]
