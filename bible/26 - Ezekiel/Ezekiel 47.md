###### 1
Then [the man] brought me back [[H7725]] to [[H413]] the entrance [[H6607]] of the temple, [[H1004]] and I saw [[H2009]] water [[H4325]] flowing [[H3318]] from under [[H8478]] the threshold [[H4670]] of the temple [[H1004]] toward the east [[H6921]] (for [[H3588]] the temple [[H1004]] faced [[H6440]] east). [[H6921]] The water [[H4325]] was coming down [[H3381]] from under [[H8478]] the south [[H3233]] side [[H3802]] of the temple, [[H1004]] south [[H5045]] of the altar. [[H4196]]

###### 2
Next he brought me out [[H3318]] through [[H1870]] the north [[H6828]] gate [[H8179]] and led me around [[H5437]] the outside [[H2351]] to [[H413]] the outer [[H2351]] gate [[H8179]] facing [[H6437]] east, [[H6921]] and there I saw [[H2009]] the water [[H4325]] trickling out [[H6349]] from [[H4480]] the south [[H3233]] side. [[H3802]]

###### 3
As the man [[H376]] went [[H3318]] eastward [[H6921]] with a measuring line [[H6957]] in his hand, [[H3027]] he measured off [[H4058]] a thousand [[H505]] cubits [[H520]] and led me through [[H5674]] ankle-deep [[H657]] water. [[H4325]]

###### 4
Then he measured off [[H4058]] a thousand [cubits] [[H505]] and led me through [[H5674]] knee-deep [[H1290]] water. [[H4325]] Again he measured [[H4058]] a thousand [cubits] [[H505]] and led me through [[H5674]] waist-deep [[H4975]] water. [[H4325]]

###### 5
Once again he measured off [[H4058]] a thousand [cubits], [[H505]] but now it was a river [[H5158]] that [[H834]] I could [[H3201]] not [[H3808]] cross, [[H5674]] because [[H3588]] the water [[H4325]] had risen [[H1342]] [and] [[H4325]] was deep enough for swimming— [[H7813]] a river [[H5158]] that [[H834]] could not [[H3808]] be crossed on foot. [[H5674]]

###### 6
“Do you see this, [[H7200]] son [[H1121]] of man?” [[H120]] he asked. [[H559]] Then he led me [[H1980]] back [[H7725]] to the bank [[H8193]] of the river. [[H5158]]

###### 7
When I arrived, [[H7725]] I saw [[H2009]] a great [[H3966]] number of [[H7227]] trees [[H6086]] along both [[H2088]] banks [[H8193]] of the river. [[H5158]]

###### 8
And he said [[H559]] to me, [[H413]] “This [[H428]] water [[H4325]] flows out [[H3318]] to [[H413]] the eastern [[H6930]] region [[H1552]] and goes down [[H3381]] into [[H5921]] the Arabah. [[H6160]] When it empties [[H935]] into [[H413]] the sea, [[H3220]] the water there [[H4325]] becomes fresh. [[H7495]]

###### 9
Wherever [[H413]] the river [[H5158]] flows, [[H935]] there will be [[H1961]] swarms [[H8317]] of living [[H5315]] creatures [[H2416]] [and] [[H1961]] a great number of [[H7227]] fish, [[H1710]] because [[H3588]] [it] [[H4325]] flows [[H935]] there [[H8033]] and makes the waters fresh; [[H7495]] so wherever [[H834]] the river [[H5158]] flows, [[H935]] everything [[H3605]] will flourish. [[H2425]]

###### 10
Fishermen [[H1728]] will stand [[H5975]] by the shore; [[H5921]] from En-gedi [[H5872]] to [[H5704]] En-eglaim [[H5882]] they will [[H1961]] spread [[H4894]] their nets [[H2764]] [to catch] fish [[H1710]] of many [[H7227]] kinds, [[H4327]] like the fish [[H1710]] of the Great [[H1419]] Sea. [[H3220]]

###### 11
But the swamps [[H1207]] and marshes [[H1360]] will not [[H3808]] become fresh; [[H7495]] they will be left [[H5414]] for salt. [[H4417]]

###### 12
Along [[H5921]] both [[H2088]] banks [[H8193]] of the river, [[H5158]] fruit [[H3978]] trees [[H6086]] of all kinds [[H3605]] will grow. [[H5927]] Their leaves [[H5929]] will not [[H3808]] wither, [[H5034]] and their fruit [[H6529]] will not [[H3808]] fail. [[H8552]] Each month [[H2320]] they will bear fruit, [[H1069]] because [[H3588]] the water [[H4325]] from [[H4480]] the sanctuary [[H4720]] flows to them. [[H3318]] Their fruit [[H6529]] will be used [[H1961]] for food [[H3978]] and their leaves [[H5929]] for healing. [[H8644]]

###### 13
This is what [[H3541]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD [[H3069]] says: [[H559]] ‘These [are] [[H1454]] the boundaries [[H1366]] by which [[H834]] you are to divide the land [[H776]] as an inheritance [[H5157]] among the twelve [[H8147]] tribes [[H7626]] of Israel; [[H3478]] Joseph [[H3130]] shall receive two portions. [[H2256]]

###### 14
You are to divide [[H5157]] it [[H853]] equally [[H376]] among them. [[H251]] Because [[H834]] I swore with an uplifted [[H5375]] hand [[H3027]] to give [[H5414]] it to your forefathers, [[H1]] this [[H2063]] land [[H776]] will fall to you [[H5307]] as an inheritance. [[H5159]]

###### 15
This [[H2088]] [shall be] the boundary [[H1366]] of the land: [[H776]] On the north [[H6828]] side [[H6285]] it will extend from [[H4480]] the Great [[H1419]] Sea [[H3220]] by way [[H1870]] of Hethlon [[H2855]] through Lebo-hamath [[H935]] to Zedad, [[H6657]]

###### 16
Berothah, [[H1268]] and Sibraim [[H5453]] (which [[H834]] is between [[H996]] the border [[H1366]] of Damascus [[H1834]] [and] [[H1366]] of Hamath), [[H2574]] as far as Hazer-hatticon, [[H2694]] which [[H834]] is on [[H413]] the border [[H1366]] of Hauran. [[H2362]]

###### 17
So the border [[H1366]] will run [[H1961]] from [[H4480]] the Sea [[H3220]] to  Hazar-enan, [[H2703]] along the northern [[H6828]] border [[H1366]] of Damascus, [[H1834]] with the territory [[H1366]] of Hamath [[H2574]] to the north. [[H6828]] [This] [will be] the northern [[H6828]] boundary. [[H6285]]

###### 18
On the east [[H6921]] side [[H6285]] it will run between [[H996]] Hauran [[H2362]] and Damascus, [[H1834]] along the Jordan [[H3383]] between [[H996]] Gilead [[H1568]] and the land [[H776]] of Israel, [[H3478]] from the northern border [[H1366]] to [[H5921]] the Eastern [[H6931]] Sea [[H3220]] and [[H853]] as far as Tamar. [[H4058]] This will be the eastern [[H6921]] boundary. [[H6285]]

###### 19
On the south [[H5045]] side [[H6285]] it will run from Tamar [[H8559]] to [[H5704]] the waters [[H4325]] of Meribath-kadesh, [[H4808]] and along the Brook [of Egypt] [[H5158]] to [[H413]] the Great [[H1419]] Sea. [[H3220]] This will be the southern [[H5045]] boundary. [[H6285]]

###### 20
And on the west [[H3220]] side, [[H6285]] the Great [[H1419]] Sea [[H3220]] will be the boundary [[H1366]] up to [[H5704]] a point opposite [[H5227]] Lebo-hamath. [[H935]] This [[H2063]] will be the western [[H3220]] boundary. [[H6285]]

###### 21
You are to divide [[H2505]] this [[H2063]] land [[H776]] among yourselves  according to the tribes [[H7626]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

###### 22
You shall allot [[H5307]] it [[H853]] as an inheritance [[H5159]] for yourselves  and for the foreigners [[H1616]] who dwell [[H1481]] among you [[H8432]] and who [[H834]] have [[H3205]] children. [[H1121]] You are to treat them [[H1961]] as native-born [[H249]] Israelites; [[H1121]] along with you, [[H854]] they shall be allotted [[H5307]] an inheritance [[H5159]] among [[H8432]] the tribes [[H7626]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

###### 23
In whatever [[H834]] tribe [[H7626]] the foreigner [[H1616]] dwells, [[H1481]] you are to assign [[H5414]] his inheritance [[H5159]] there, [[H8033]] declares [[H5002]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD.’ [[H3068]]
