###### 1
In the tenth [[H6224]] year, [[H8141]] in the tenth [month], [[H6224]] on the twelfth [[H8147]] day, [[H2320]] the word [[H1697]] of the LORD [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] to me, [[H413]] saying, [[H559]]

###### 2
“Son [[H1121]] of man, [[H120]] set [[H7760]] your face [[H6440]] against [[H5921]] Pharaoh [[H6547]] king [[H4428]] of Egypt [[H4714]] and prophesy [[H5012]] against him [[H5921]] and against [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] of Egypt. [[H4714]]

###### 3
Speak [[H1696]] to him and tell him [[H559]] that this is what [[H3541]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD [[H3069]] says: [[H559]] ‘Behold, [[H2005]] I am against you, [[H5921]] O Pharaoh [[H6547]] king [[H4428]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] O great [[H1419]] monster [[H8577]] who lies [[H7257]] among [[H8432]] his rivers, [[H2975]] who [[H834]] says, [[H559]] “The Nile is mine; [[H2975]] I [[H589]] made it for myself. [[H6213]]

###### 4
But I will put [[H5414]] hooks [[H2397]] in your jaws [[H3895]] and make [[H1692]] the fish [[H1710]] of your streams [[H2975]] cling to your scales. [[H7193]] I will haul you up [[H5927]] out of [[H8432]] your rivers, [[H2975]] and [[H853]] all [[H3605]] the fish [[H1710]] of your streams [[H2975]] will cling [[H1692]] to your scales. [[H7193]]

###### 5
I will leave [[H5203]] you in the desert, [[H4057]] you [[H853]] and [[H853]] all [[H3605]] the fish [[H1710]] of your streams. [[H2975]] You will fall [[H5307]] on [[H5921]] the open [[H6440]] field [[H7704]] and will not [[H3808]] be taken away [[H622]] or gathered for burial. [[H6908]] I have given you [[H5414]] as food [[H402]] to the beasts [[H2416]] of the earth [[H776]] and the birds [[H5775]] of the air. [[H8064]]

###### 6
Then all [[H3605]] the people [[H3427]] of Egypt [[H4714]] will know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I [[H589]] am the LORD. [[H3068]] For [[H3282]] you were only [[H1961]] a staff [[H4938]] of reeds [[H7070]] to the house [[H1004]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

###### 7
When Israel grasped [[H8610]] you  with their hands, [[H3709]] you splintered [[H7533]] and tore [[H1234]] open [[H3605]] their  shoulders; [[H3802]] when they leaned [[H8172]] on you, [[H5921]] you broke [[H7665]] and their backs [[H4975]] were wrenched.’ [[H5976]]

###### 8
Therefore [[H3651]] this is what [[H3541]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD [[H3069]] says: [[H559]] ‘I will bring [[H935]] a sword [[H2719]] against you [[H5921]] and cut off [[H3772]] from you [[H4480]] man [[H120]] and beast. [[H929]]

###### 9
The land [[H776]] of Egypt [[H4714]] will become [[H1961]] a desolate [[H8077]] wasteland. [[H2723]] Then they will know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I [[H589]] am the LORD. [[H3068]] Because [[H3282]] you said, [[H559]] “The Nile [is] [[H2975]] mine;  I [[H589]] made it,” [[H6213]]

###### 10
therefore [[H3651]] I am [[H2005]] against you [[H413]] and against [[H413]] your rivers. [[H2975]] I will turn [[H5414]] the land [[H776]] of Egypt [[H4714]] into a ruin, [[H2723]] a desolate [[H8077]] wasteland [[H2721]] from Migdol [[H4024]] to Syene, [[H5482]] and as far as [[H5704]] the border [[H1366]] of Cush. [[H3568]]

###### 11
No [[H3808]] foot [[H7272]] of man [[H120]] [or] [[H3808]] beast [[H929]] will pass [[H5674]] through,  and [[H3808]] it will be uninhabited [[H3427]] for forty [[H705]] years. [[H8141]]

###### 12
I will make [[H5414]] the land [[H776]] of Egypt [[H4714]] a desolation [[H8077]] among [[H8432]] desolate [[H8074]] lands, [[H776]] and her cities [[H5892]] will lie [[H1961]] desolate [[H8077]] forty [[H705]] years [[H8141]] among [[H8432]] the ruined [[H2717]] cities. [[H5892]] And I will disperse [[H6327]] the Egyptians [[H4714]] among the nations [[H1471]] and scatter them [[H2219]] throughout the countries. [[H776]]

###### 13
For [[H3588]] this is what [[H3541]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD [[H3069]] says: [[H559]] ‘At [[H4480]] the end [[H7093]] of forty [[H705]] years [[H8141]] I will gather [[H6908]] the Egyptians [[H4714]] from the nations [[H5971]] to which [[H834]] they were scattered. [[H6327]]

###### 14
I will restore [[H7725]] Egypt [[H4714]] from captivity [[H7622]] and bring them back [[H7725]] to [[H5921]] the land [[H776]] of Pathros, [[H6624]] the land [[H776]] of their origin. [[H4351]] There [[H8033]] they will be [[H1961]] a lowly [[H8217]] kingdom. [[H4467]]

###### 15
Egypt will be [[H1961]] the lowliest [[H8217]] of kingdoms [[H4467]] and will never [[H3808]] again [[H5750]] exalt itself [[H5375]] above [[H5921]] the nations. [[H1471]] For I will diminish [Egypt] [[H4591]] so that it will never again [[H1115]] rule [[H7287]] over the nations. [[H1471]]

###### 16
Egypt will never [[H3808]] again be [[H1961]] an object of trust [[H4009]] for the house [[H1004]] of Israel, [[H3478]] but will remind them [[H2142]] of [their] iniquity [[H5771]] in turning [[H6437]] to the Egyptians. [[H310]] Then they will know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I [[H589]] am the Lord [[H136]] GOD.’” [[H3068]]

###### 17
In the twenty-seventh [[H6242]] year, [[H8141]] in the first month, [[H7223]] on the first [[H259]] day, [[H2320]] the word [[H1697]] of the LORD [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] to me, [[H413]] saying, [[H559]]

###### 18
“Son [[H1121]] of man, [[H120]] Nebuchadnezzar [[H5019]] king [[H4428]] of Babylon [[H894]] caused his army [[H2428]] to labor [[H5647]] strenuously [[H5656]] against [[H413]] Tyre. [[H6865]] Every [[H3605]] head [[H7218]] was made bald [[H7139]] and every [[H3605]] shoulder [[H3802]] made raw. [[H4803]] But he and his army [[H2428]] had [[H1961]] no [[H3808]] wages [[H7939]] from Tyre [[H6865]] for [[H5921]] the labor [[H5656]] they expended [[H5647]] on it. [[H5921]]

###### 19
Therefore [[H3651]] this is what [[H3541]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD [[H3069]] says: [[H559]] ‘I will give [[H5414]] the land [[H776]] of Egypt [[H4714]] to Nebuchadnezzar [[H5019]] king [[H4428]] of Babylon, [[H894]] who will carry off [[H5375]] its wealth, [[H1995]] seize [[H7997]] its spoil, [[H7998]] and remove [[H962]] its plunder. [[H957]] This will be [[H1961]] the wages [[H7939]] for his army. [[H2426]]

###### 20
I have given [[H5414]] him the land [[H776]] of Egypt [[H4714]] as the reward [[H6468]] for his labor, [[H5647]] because [[H834]] it was done [[H6213]] for Me,  declares [[H5002]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD.’ [[H3069]]

###### 21
In that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] I will cause a horn [[H7161]] to sprout [[H6779]] for the house [[H1004]] of Israel, [[H3478]] and  I will open [[H5414]] your mouth [[H6310]] to speak [[H6610]] among them. [[H8432]] Then they will know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I [[H589]] am the LORD.” [[H3068]]
