###### 1
My [[G1473]] brothers, [[G80]] as you hold out [[G2192]] [your] [[G3588]] faith [[G4102]] in [[G3588]] our [[G1473]] glorious [[G1391]] Lord [[G2962]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ, [[G5547]] {do} not [[G3361]] [show] [[G1722]] favoritism. [[G4382]]

###### 2
Suppose [[G1437]] a man [[G435]] comes [[G1525]] into [[G1519]] your [[G4771]] meeting [[G4864]] [wearing] a gold ring [[G5554]] [and] [[G1722]] fine [[G2986]] clothes, [[G2066]] and [[G1161]] a poor [man] [[G4434]] in [[G1722]] shabby [[G4508]] clothes [[G2066]] also [[G2532]] comes in. [[G1525]]

###### 3
[If] [[G1161]] you lavish attention [[G1914]] on [[G1909]] the [man] [[G3588]] in [[G5409]] fine [[G2986]] clothes [[G2066]] and [[G2532]] say, [[G2036]] “Here [is] [[G5602]] a seat [[G2521]] of honor,” [[G2573]] [but] [[G2532]] say [[G2036]] to the [[G3588]] poor [man] [[G4434]] “You [[G4771]] must stand,” [[G2476]] or, [[G2228]] “Sit [[G2521]] at [[G5259]] my [[G1473]] feet,” [[G5286]]

###### 4
have you not discriminated [[G1252]] among [[G1722]] yourselves [[G1438]] and [[G2532]] become [[G1096]] judges [with] [[G2923]] evil [[G4190]] thoughts? [[G1261]]

###### 5
Listen, [[G191]] my [[G1473]] beloved [[G27]] brothers: [[G80]] {Has} not [[G3756]] God [[G2316]] chosen [[G1586]] the [[G3588]] poor [[G4434]] of this world [[G2889]] [to be] rich [[G4145]] in [[G1722]] faith [[G4102]] and [[G2532]] to inherit [[G2818]] the [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] He promised [[G1861]] those who [[G3588]] love [[G25]] Him? [[G846]]

###### 6
But [[G1161]] you [[G4771]] have dishonored [[G818]] the [[G3588]] poor. [[G4434]] [Is it] not [[G3756]] the [[G3588]] rich [[G4145]] who oppress [[G2616]] you [[G4771]] and [[G2532]] drag [[G1670]] you [[G4771]] into [[G1519]] court? [[G2922]]

###### 7
{Are} they [[G846]] not [[G3756]] the ones who blaspheme [[G987]] the [[G3588]] noble [[G2570]] Name [[G3686]] by which [[G1909]] you [[G4771]] have been called? [[G1941]]

###### 8
If [[G1487]] you really keep [[G5055]] [the] royal [[G937]] law [[G3551]] stated in [[G2596]] Scripture, [[G1124]] “Love [[G25]] your [[G4771]] neighbor [[G4139]] as [[G5613]] yourself,” [[G4572]] you are doing [[G4160]] well. [[G2573]]

###### 9
But [[G1161]] if [[G1487]] you show favoritism, [[G4380]] you [[G2038]] sin [[G266]] [and] are convicted [[G1651]] by [[G5259]] the [[G3588]] Law [[G3551]] as [[G5613]] transgressors. [[G3848]]

###### 10
Whoever [[G3748]] keeps [[G5083]] the [[G3588]] whole [[G3650]] Law [[G3551]] but [[G1161]] stumbles [[G4417]] at [[G1722]] just one [point] [[G1520]] is [[G1096]] guilty [[G1777]] of [breaking] all of it. [[G3956]]

###### 11
For [[G1063]] He who [[G3588]] said, [[G2036]] “Do not commit adultery,” [[G3431]] also [[G2532]] said, [[G2036]] “Do not murder.” [[G5407]] If [[G1487]] you do not commit adultery, [[G3431]] but [[G1161]] do commit murder, [[G5407]] you have become [[G1096]] a lawbreaker. [[G3551]]

###### 12
Speak [[G2980]] and [[G2532]] act [[G4160]] as [[G5613]] those who are going [[G3195]] to be judged [[G2919]] by [[G1223]] [the] Law [[G3551]] that gives freedom. [[G1657]]

###### 13
For [[G1063]] judgment [[G2920]] without mercy [ will be shown to ] [[G448]] anyone who [[G3588]] has not been merciful. [[G4160]] Mercy [[G1656]] triumphs over [[G2620]] judgment. [[G2920]]

###### 14
What [[G5101]] good [is it], [[G3786]] my [[G1473]] brothers, [[G80]] if [[G1437]] someone [[G5100]] claims [[G3004]] to have [[G2192]] faith, [[G4102]] but [[G1161]] has [[G2192]] no [[G3361]] deeds? [[G2041]] Can [[G1410]] such [[G3588]] faith [[G4102]] save [[G4982]] him? [[G846]]

###### 15
Suppose [[G1437]] a brother [[G80]] or [[G2228]] sister [[G79]] is [[G5225]] without clothes [[G1131]] and [[G2532]] daily [[G2184]] food. [[G5160]]

###### 16
[If] [[G1161]] one [[G5100]] of [[G1537]] you [[G4771]] tells [[G2036]] him, [[G846]] “Go [[G5217]] in [[G1722]] peace; [[G1515]] stay warm [[G2328]] and [[G2532]] well fed,” [[G5526]] but [[G1161]] {does} not [[G3361]] provide for [[G1325]] [his] [[G3588]] physical [[G4983]] needs, [[G2006]] what [[G5101]] good [ is that ]? [[G3786]]

###### 17
So [[G3779]] too, [[G2532]] faith [[G4102]] by [[G2596]] itself, [[G1438]] if [[G1437]] it is not complemented [[G2192]] by action, [[G2041]] is [[G1510]] dead. [[G3498]]

###### 18
But [[G235]] someone [[G5100]] will say, [[G2046]] “You [[G4771]] have [[G2192]] faith [[G4102]] and I [[G2504]] have [[G2192]] deeds.” [[G2041]] Show [[G1166]] me [[G1473]] your [[G4771]] faith [[G4102]] without [[G5565]] deeds, [[G2041]] and I [[G2504]] will show [[G1166]] you [[G4771]] [my] [[G3588]] faith [[G4102]] by [[G1537]] my [[G1473]] deeds. [[G2041]]

###### 19
You [[G4771]] believe [[G4100]] that [[G3754]] God [[G2316]] is [[G1510]] one. [[G1520]] Good [[G2573]] for you! [[G4160]] Even [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] demons [[G1140]] believe [that]— [[G4100]] and [[G2532]] shudder. [[G5425]]

###### 20
O [[G5599]] foolish [[G2756]] man, [[G444]] do you want [[G2309]] evidence [[G1097]] that [[G3754]] faith [[G4102]] without [[G5565]] deeds [[G2041]] is [[G1510]] worthless? [[G692]]

###### 21
{Was} not [[G3756]] our [[G1473]] father [[G3962]] Abraham [[G11]] justified [[G1344]] by [[G1537]] what he did [[G2041]] when he offered [[G399]] his [[G846]] son [[G5207]] Isaac [[G2464]] on [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] altar? [[G2379]]

###### 22
You see [[G991]] that [[G3754]] [his] [[G3588]] faith [[G4102]] was working with [[G4903]] his [[G846]] actions, [[G2041]] and [[G2532]] [his] [[G3588]] faith [[G4102]] was perfected [[G5048]] by [[G1537]] what [[G3588]] he did. [[G2041]]

###### 23
And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] Scripture [[G1124]] was fulfilled [[G4137]] that [[G3588]] says, [[G3004]] “Abraham [[G11]] believed [[G4100]] God, [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] it was credited [[G3049]] to him [[G846]] as [[G1519]] righteousness,” [[G1343]] and [[G2532]] he was called [[G2564]] a friend [[G5384]] of God. [[G2316]]

###### 24
As you can see, [[G3708]] a man [[G444]] is justified [[G1344]] by [[G1537]] [his] deeds [[G2041]] and [[G2532]] not [[G3756]] by [[G1537]] faith [[G4102]] alone. [[G3440]]

###### 25
In the same way, [[G3668]] {was} not [[G3756]] even [[G2532]] Rahab [[G4460]] the [[G3588]] prostitute [[G4204]] justified [[G1344]] by [[G1537]] her actions [[G2041]] when she welcomed [[G5264]] the [[G3588]] messengers [[G32]] and [[G2532]] sent [them] off [[G1544]] on another [[G2087]] route? [[G3598]]

###### 26
As [[G5618]] the [[G3588]] body [[G4983]] without [[G5565]] [the] spirit [[G4151]] is [[G1510]] dead, [[G3498]] so [[G3779]] faith [[G4102]] without [[G5565]] deeds [[G2041]] is [[G1510]] dead. [[G3498]]
