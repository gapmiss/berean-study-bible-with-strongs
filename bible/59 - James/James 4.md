###### 1
What [causes] [[G4159]] conflicts [[G4171]] and [[G2532]] quarrels [[G3163]] among [[G1722]] you? [[G4771]] Don’t [they] [[G3756]] [come] [[G1782]] from [[G1537]] [the] [[G4771]] passions [[G2237]] at war [[G4754]] within [[G1722]] you? [[G4771]]

###### 2
You crave [[G1937]] [what] [[G2532]] {you do} not [[G3756]] have. [[G2192]] You kill [[G5407]] and [[G2532]] covet, [[G2206]] but [[G2532]] are unable [[G1410]] to obtain [it]. [[G2013]] You quarrel [[G3164]] and [[G2532]] fight. [[G4170]] You do not have, [[G2192]] because [[G1223]] you [[G4771]] {do} not [[G3361]] ask. [[G154]]

###### 3
[And when] you do ask, [[G154]] {you do} not [[G3756]] receive, [[G2983]] because [[G1360]] you ask [[G154]] with wrong motives, [[G2560]] that [[G2443]] you may squander [it] [[G1159]] on [[G1722]] your [[G4771]] pleasures. [[G2237]]

###### 4
[You] adulteresses! [[G3428]] Do you not know [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] friendship [[G5373]] with the [[G3588]] world [[G2889]] is [[G1510]] hostility [[G2189]] [toward] [[G3588]] God? [[G2316]] Therefore, [[G3767]] whoever [[G3739]] chooses [[G1014]] to be [[G1510]] a friend [[G5384]] of the [[G3588]] world [[G2889]] renders himself [[G2525]] an enemy [[G2190]] of God. [[G2316]]

###### 5
Or [[G2228]] do you think [[G1380]] the [[G3588]] Scripture [[G1124]] says [[G3004]] without reason [that] [[G2761]] the [[G3588]] Spirit [[G4151]] He caused to dwell [[G2730]] in [[G1722]] us [[G1473]] yearns [[G1971]] with [[G4314]] envy? [[G5355]]

###### 6
But [[G1161]] He gives [us] [[G1325]] more [[G3173]] grace. [[G5485]] This is why [[G1352]] it says: [[G3004]] “God [[G2316]] opposes [[G498]] [the] proud, [[G5244]] but [[G1161]] gives [[G1325]] grace [[G5485]] to [the] humble.” [[G5011]]

###### 7
Submit yourselves, [[G5293]] then, [[G3767]] to God. [[G2316]] Resist [[G436]] the [[G3588]] devil, [[G1228]] and [[G2532]] he will flee [[G5343]] from [[G575]] you. [[G4771]]

###### 8
Draw near [[G1448]] to God, [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] He will draw near [[G1448]] to you. [[G4771]] Cleanse [[G2511]] [your] hands, [[G5495]] [you] sinners, [[G268]] and [[G2532]] purify [[G48]] [your] hearts, [[G2588]] [you] double-minded. [[G1374]]

###### 9
Grieve, [[G5003]] mourn, [[G3996]] and [[G2532]] weep. [[G2799]] Turn [[G3344]] your [[G4771]] laughter [[G1071]] to [[G1519]] mourning, [[G3997]] and [[G2532]] [your] [[G3588]] joy [[G5479]] to [[G1519]] gloom. [[G2726]]

###### 10
Humble yourselves [[G5013]] before [[G1799]] [the] Lord, [[G2962]] and [[G2532]] He will exalt [[G5312]] you. [[G4771]]

###### 11
Brothers, [[G80]] {do] not [[G3361]] slander [[G2635]] one another. [[G240]] Anyone who [[G3588]] speaks against [[G2635]] [his] brother [[G80]] or [[G2228]] judges [[G2919]] [him] [[G80]] speaks against [[G2635]] [the] Law [[G3551]] and [[G2532]] judges [[G2919]] [it]. [[G3551]] And [[G1161]] if [[G1487]] you judge [[G2919]] [the] Law, [[G3551]] you are [[G1510]] not [[G3756]] a practitioner [[G4163]] of [the] Law, [[G3551]] but [[G235]] a judge [of it]. [[G2923]]

###### 12
There is [[G1510]] only one [[G1520]] Lawgiver [[G3550]] and [[G2532]] Judge, [[G2923]] the [One who] [[G3588]] is able [[G1410]] to save [[G4982]] and [[G2532]] destroy. [[G622]] But [[G1161]] who [[G5101]] are [[G1510]] you [[G4771]] to judge [[G2919]] [your] [[G3588]] neighbor? [[G4139]]

###### 13
Come [[G71]] now, [[G3568]] you who [[G3588]] say, [[G3004]] “Today [[G4594]] or [[G2228]] tomorrow [[G839]] we will go [[G4198]] to [[G1519]] this or that [[G3592]] city, [[G4172]] spend [[G4160]] a year [[G1763]] there, [[G1563]] carry on business, [[G1710]] and [[G2532]] make a profit.” [[G2770]]

###### 14
You [[G3748]] do not even know [[G1987]] what [will happen] [[G3588]] tomorrow! [[G839]] What [is] [[G4169]] your [[G4771]] life? [[G2222]] You are [[G1510]] a mist [[G822]] that appears [[G5316]] for a little [while] [[G3641]] and [[G2532]] then [[G1899]] vanishes. [[G853]]

###### 15
Instead, [[G473]] you [ought] [[G4771]] to say, [[G3004]] “If [[G1437]] the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] is willing, [[G2309]] we will live [[G2198]] and [[G2532]] do [[G4160]] this [[G3778]] or [[G2228]] that.” [[G1565]]

###### 16
As it is, [[G3568]] you boast [[G2744]] in [[G1722]] your [[G4771]] proud intentions. [[G212]] All [[G3956]] such [[G5108]] boasting [[G2746]] is [[G1510]] evil. [[G4190]]

###### 17
Therefore, [[G3767]] whoever [[G846]] knows [[G1492]] [the] right thing [[G2570]] to do, [[G4160]] yet [[G2532]] fails [[G3361]] to do [it], [[G4160]] is [[G1510]] guilty of sin. [[G266]]
