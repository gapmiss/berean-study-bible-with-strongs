[[Hosea 7|←]] • [[Hosea 9|→]]

###### 1
[Put] the trumpet [[H7782]] to [[H413]] your lips! [[H2441]] An eagle [[H5404]] comes against [[H5921]] the house [[H1004]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] because [[H3282]] they have transgressed [[H5674]] My covenant [[H1285]] and rebelled [[H6586]] against [[H5921]] My law. [[H8451]]

###### 2
Israel [[H3478]] cries out [[H2199]] to Me,  “O our God, [[H430]] we know You!” [[H3045]]

###### 3
[But] Israel [[H3478]] has rejected [[H2186]] good; [[H2896]] an enemy [[H341]] will pursue him. [[H7291]]

###### 4
They [[H1992]] set up kings, [[H4427]] but not [[H3808]] by Me. [[H4480]] They make princes, [[H8323]] but without [[H3808]] My approval. [[H3045]] With their silver [[H3701]] and gold [[H2091]] they make [[H6213]] themselves  idols, [[H6091]] to [[H4616]] their own destruction. [[H3772]]

###### 5
He has rejected [[H2186]] your calf, [[H5695]] O Samaria. [[H8111]] My anger [[H639]] burns [[H2734]] against them.  How long will they be [[H5704]] incapable [[H3808]] of innocence? [[H5356]]

###### 6
For [[H3588]] this thing [[H1931]] is from Israel— [[H3478]] a craftsman [[H2796]] made it, [[H6213]] and it [[H1931]] is not [[H3808]] God. [[H430]] It will be [[H1961]] broken to pieces, [[H7616]] that calf [[H5695]] of Samaria. [[H8111]]

###### 7
Indeed, [[H3588]] they sow [[H2232]] the wind [[H7307]] and reap [[H7114]] the whirlwind. [[H5492]] There is no [[H369]] standing grain; [[H7054]] what sprouts [[H6780]] fails [[H1097]] to yield [[H6213]] flour. [[H7058]] Even if [[H194]] it should produce, [[H6213]] the foreigners [[H2114]] would swallow it up. [[H1104]]

###### 8
Israel [[H3478]] is swallowed up! [[H1104]] Now [[H6258]] they are [[H1961]] among the nations [[H1471]] like a worthless [[H369]] vessel. [[H3627]]

###### 9
For [[H3588]] they [[H1992]] have gone up [[H5927]] to Assyria [[H804]] like a wild donkey [[H6501]] on its own. [[H909]] Ephraim [[H669]] has hired [[H8566]] lovers. [[H158]]

###### 10
Though [[H1571]] they hire allies [[H8566]] among the nations, [[H1471]] I will now [[H6258]] round them up, [[H6908]] and they will begin [[H2490]] to diminish [[H4592]] under the oppression [[H4853]] of the king [[H4428]] of princes. [[H8269]]

###### 11
Though [[H3588]] Ephraim [[H669]] multiplied [[H7235]] the altars [[H4196]] for sin, [[H2398]] they became [[H1961]] his  altars [[H4196]] for sinning. [[H2398]]

###### 12
Though I wrote [[H3789]] for them [[H3789]] the great things [[H7239]] of My law, [[H8451]] they regarded them [[H2803]] as [[H3644]] something strange. [[H2114]]

###### 13
Though they offer [[H2076]] sacrifices [[H2077]] given to Me [[H1890]] and eat [[H398]] the meat, [[H1320]] the LORD [[H3069]] does not [[H3808]] accept them. [[H7521]] Now [[H6258]] He will remember [[H2142]] their iniquity [[H5771]] and punish [[H6485]] their sins: [[H2403]] They [[H1992]] will return [[H7725]] to Egypt. [[H4714]]

###### 14
Israel [[H3478]] has forgotten [[H7911]] his Maker [[H6213]] and built [[H1129]] palaces; [[H1964]] Judah [[H3063]] has multiplied [[H7235]] its fortified [[H1219]] cities. [[H5892]] But I will send [[H7971]] fire [[H784]] upon their cities, [[H5892]] and it will consume [[H398]] their citadels. [[H759]]
