# Hosea 11

[[Hosea 10|←]] • [[Hosea 12|→]]

###### 1
When [[H3588]] Israel [[H3478]] was a child, [[H5288]] I loved him, [[H157]] and out of Egypt [[H4714]] I called [[H7121]] My son. [[H1121]]

###### 2
But the more I called [[H7121]] them,  the farther [[H3651]] they departed [[H1980]] from Me. [[H6440]] They sacrificed [[H2076]] to the Baals [[H1168]] and burned incense [[H6999]] to carved images. [[H6456]]

###### 3
It was I [[H595]] who taught Ephraim [[H669]] to walk, [[H7270]] taking [[H3947]] them in [[H5921]] My arms, [[H2220]] but they never [[H3808]] realized [[H3045]] that it was I [[H3588]] who healed them. [[H7495]]

###### 4
I led [[H4900]] with cords [[H2256]] of kindness, [[H120]] with ropes [[H5688]] of love; [[H160]] I lifted [[H7311]] the yoke [[H5923]] from [[H5921]] their neck [[H3895]] and bent down [[H328]] to feed them. [[H398]]

###### 5
Will they not [[H3808]] return [[H7725]] to [[H413]] the land [[H776]] of Egypt [[H4714]] and be ruled [[H4428]] by Assyria [[H804]] because [[H3588]] they refused [[H3985]] to repent? [[H7725]]

###### 6
A sword [[H2719]] will whirl [[H2342]] through their cities; [[H5892]] it will destroy [[H3615]] the bars of their gates [[H905]] and consume [them] [[H398]] in their own plans. [[H4156]]

###### 7
My people [[H5971]] are bent [[H8511]] on turning from Me. [[H4878]] Though they call [[H7121]] to [[H413]] the Most High, [[H5920]] He will by no means [[H3808]] exalt them. [[H7311]]

###### 8
How [[H349]] can I give you up, [[H5414]] O Ephraim? [[H669]] How can I surrender you, [[H4042]] O Israel? [[H3478]] How [[H349]] can I make [[H5414]] you like Admah? [[H126]] How can I treat [[H7760]] you like Zeboiim? [[H6636]] My heart [[H3820]] is turned [[H2015]] within Me; [[H5921]] My compassion [[H5150]] is stirred! [[H3648]]

###### 9
I will not [[H3808]] execute [[H6213]] the full fury [[H2740]] of My anger; [[H639]] I will not [[H3808]] turn back [[H7725]] to destroy [[H7843]] Ephraim. [[H669]] For [[H3588]] I [[H595]] am God [[H410]] and not [[H3808]] man— [[H582]] the Holy [[H6918]] One among you— [[H7130]] and I will not [[H3808]] come [[H935]] in wrath. [[H5892]]

###### 10
They will walk after [[H310]] the LORD; [[H3068]] He will roar [[H7580]] like a lion. [[H738]] When [[H3588]] He [[H1931]] roars, [[H7580]] His children [[H1121]] will come trembling [[H2729]] from the west. [[H3220]]

###### 11
They will come trembling [[H2729]] like birds [[H6833]] from Egypt [[H4714]] and like doves [[H3123]] from the land [[H776]] of Assyria. [[H804]] Then I will settle [[H3427]] them in [[H5921]] their homes, [[H1004]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD. [[H3068]]

###### 12
Ephraim [[H669]] surrounds [[H5437]] me with lies, [[H3585]] the house [[H1004]] of Israel [[H3478]] with deceit; [[H4820]] but Judah [[H3063]] still [[H5750]] walks [[H7300]] with [[H5973]] God [[H410]] [and is] faithful [[H539]] to [[H5973]] the Holy One. [[H6918]]
