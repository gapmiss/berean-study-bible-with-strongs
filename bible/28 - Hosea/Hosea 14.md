###### 1
Return, [[H7725]] O Israel, [[H3478]] to [[H5704]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God, [[H430]] for [[H3588]] you have stumbled [[H3782]] by your iniquity. [[H5771]]

###### 2
Bring [[H3947]] your [[H5973]] confessions [[H1697]] and return [[H7725]] to [[H413]] the LORD. [[H3068]] Say [[H559]] to Him: [[H413]] “Take away [[H5375]] all [[H3605]] our iniquity [[H5771]] and receive [[H3947]] [us] graciously, [[H2896]] that we may present [[H7999]] the fruit [[H6499]] of our lips. [[H8193]]

###### 3
Assyria [[H804]] will not [[H3808]] save us, [[H3467]] nor will we [[H3808]] ride [[H7392]] on [[H5921]] horses. [[H5483]] We will never again [[H3808]] say, [[H559]] ‘Our gods!’ [[H430]] to the work [[H4639]] of our own hands. [[H3027]] For [[H834]] in You  the orphan [[H3490]] finds compassion.” [[H7355]]

###### 4
I will heal [[H7495]] their apostasy; [[H4878]] I will freely [[H5071]] love them, [[H157]] for [[H3588]] My anger [[H639]] has turned away [[H7725]] from them. [[H4480]]

###### 5
I will be [[H1961]] like the dew [[H2919]] to Israel; [[H3478]] he will blossom [[H6524]] like the lily [[H7799]] and take [[H5221]] root [[H8328]] like the cedars of Lebanon. [[H3844]]

###### 6
His shoots [[H3127]] will sprout, [[H1980]] and his splendor [[H1935]] will be [[H1961]] like the olive tree, [[H2132]] his fragrance [[H7381]] like [the cedars of] Lebanon. [[H3844]]

###### 7
They will return [[H7725]] and dwell [[H3427]] in his shade; [[H6738]] they will grow [[H2421]] grain [[H1715]] and blossom [[H6524]] like the vine. [[H1612]] His renown will be [[H2143]] like the wine [[H3196]] of Lebanon. [[H3844]]

###### 8
O Ephraim, [[H669]] what [[H4100]] have I to do  anymore [[H5750]] with idols? [[H6091]] It is I [[H589]] who answer [[H6030]] and watch over him. [[H7789]] I [am] like [[H589]] a green [[H7488]] cypress tree; [[H1265]] your fruit [[H6529]] comes [[H4672]] from Me. [[H4480]]

###### 9
Whoever [[H4310]] is wise, [[H2450]] let him understand [[H995]] these things; [[H428]] [whoever] is discerning, [[H995]] let him know them. [[H3045]] For [[H3588]] the ways [[H1870]] of the LORD [[H3069]] are right, [[H3477]] and the righteous [[H6662]] walk [[H1980]] in them,  but the rebellious [[H6586]] stumble [[H3782]] in them.
