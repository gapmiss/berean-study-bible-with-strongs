[[Daniel 12|←]] • [[Hosea 2|→]]

---

### 1
[This is] the word [[H1697]] of the LORD [[H3068]] that [[H834]] came [[H1961]] to [[H413]] Hosea [[H1954]] son [[H1121]] of Beeri [[H882]] in the days [[H3117]] of Uzziah, [[H5818]] Jotham, [[H3147]] Ahaz, [[H271]] and Hezekiah, [[H2396]] kings [[H4428]] of Judah, [[H3063]] and [of] [[H3117]] Jeroboam [[H3379]] son [[H1121]] of Jehoash, [[H3101]] king [[H4428]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

### 2
When the LORD [[H3068]] first [[H8462]] spoke [[H1696]] to Hosea, [[H1954]] He [[H3068]] told [[H559]] him, [[H1954]] “Go, [[H1980]] take [[H3947]] a prostitute [[H2183]] as your  wife [[H802]] and have children [[H3206]] of adultery, [[H2183]] because [[H3588]] this land [[H776]] is flagrantly prostituting itself [[H2181]] [by departing] from [[H310]] the LORD.” [[H3068]]

### 3
So [Hosea] went [[H1980]] and married [[H3947]] Gomer [[H1586]] daughter [[H1323]] of Diblaim, [[H1691]] and she conceived [[H2029]] and bore [[H3205]] him  a son. [[H1121]]

### 4
Then the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H559]] to [Hosea], [[H413]] “Name [[H7121]] him Jezreel, [[H3157]] for [[H3588]] soon [[H5750]] I will bring [[H6485]] the bloodshed [[H1818]] of Jezreel [[H3157]] upon [[H5921]] the house [[H1004]] of Jehu, [[H3058]] and I will put an end [[H7673]] to the kingdom [[H4468]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

### 5
And [[H1961]] on that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] I will break [[H7665]] the bow [[H7198]] of Israel [[H3478]] in the Valley [[H6010]] of Jezreel.” [[H3157]]

### 6
[Gomer] again [[H5750]] conceived [[H2029]] and gave birth to [[H3205]] a daughter, [[H1323]] and [the LORD] said [[H559]] to [Hosea],  “Name [[H7121]] her [[H8034]] Lo-ruhamah, [[H3819]] for [[H3588]] I will no [[H3808]] longer [[H3254]] have compassion [[H7355]] on the house  of Israel, [[H3478]] that [[H3588]] I should ever [[H5375]] forgive [[H5375]] them. 

### 7
Yet [[H853]] I will have compassion [[H7355]] on the house [[H1004]] of Judah, [[H3063]] and I will deliver them, [[H3467]] not [[H3808]] by bow [[H7198]] or sword [[H2719]] or war, [[H4421]] not by horses [[H5483]] and cavalry, [[H6571]] but by the LORD [[H3068]] their God.” [[H430]]

### 8
After she had weaned [[H1580]] Lo-ruhamah, [[H3819]] [Gomer] conceived [[H2029]] and gave birth to [[H3205]] a son. [[H1121]]

### 9
And the LORD said, [[H559]] “Name [[H7121]] him [[H8034]] Lo-ammi, [[H3818]] for [[H3588]] you [[H859]] are not [[H3808]] My people, [[H5971]] and I [[H595]] am not [[H3808]] your God. [[H1961]]

### 10
Yet the number [[H4557]] of the Israelites [[H1121]] will be [[H1961]] like the sand [[H2344]] of the sea, [[H3220]] which [[H834]] cannot [[H3808]] be measured [[H4058]] [or] [[H3808]] numbered. [[H5608]] And [[H1961]] in the place [[H4725]] where [[H834]] it was said [[H559]] to them, [[H1992]] ‘You [[H859]] [are] not [[H3808]] My people,’ [[H5971]] they will be called [[H559]] ‘sons [[H1121]] of the living [[H2416]] God.’ [[H410]]

### 11
Then the people [[H1121]] of Judah [[H3063]] [and] [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] will be gathered [[H6908]] together, [[H3162]] and they will appoint [[H7760]] for themselves one [[H259]] leader, [[H7218]] and will go up [[H5927]] out [[H4480]] of the land. [[H776]] For [[H3588]] great [will be] [[H1419]] the day [[H3117]] of Jezreel. [[H3157]]
