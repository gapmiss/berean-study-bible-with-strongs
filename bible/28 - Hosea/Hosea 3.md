###### 1
Then the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H559]] to me, [[H413]] “Go [[H1980]] show love [[H157]] to your wife [[H802]] again, [[H5750]] though she is loved [[H157]] by another [[H7453]] and is an adulteress. [[H5003]] [Love her] [[H160]] as the LORD [[H3068]] loves [[H157]] the Israelites, [[H1121]] though they [[H1992]] turn [[H6437]] to [[H413]] other [[H312]] gods [[H430]] [and offer] cakes [[H809]] of raisin. [[H6025]]

###### 2
So I bought her [[H3739]] for fifteen [shekels] [[H2568]] of silver [[H3701]] and a homer [[H2563]] and a lethek [[H3963]] of barley. [[H8184]]

###### 3
Then I said [[H559]] to her, [[H413]] “You must live [[H3427]] with me  for many [[H7227]] days; [[H3117]] you must not [[H3808]] be promiscuous [[H2181]] or belong to [[H1961]] another, [[H376]] and [[H1571]] I [[H589]] will do the same for you.” [[H413]]

###### 4
For [[H3588]] the Israelites [[H1121]] must live [[H3427]] many [[H7227]] days [[H3117]] without [[H369]] king [[H4428]] or prince, [[H8269]] without [[H369]] sacrifice [[H2077]] or [[H369]] sacred pillar, [[H4676]] and without [[H369]] ephod [[H646]] or idol. [[H8655]]

###### 5
Afterward, [[H310]] the people [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] will return [[H7725]] and seek [[H1245]] the LORD [[H3069]] their God [[H430]] and David [[H1732]] their king. [[H4428]] They will come trembling [[H6342]] to [[H413]] the LORD [[H3069]] and to [[H413]] His goodness [[H2898]] in the last [[H319]] days. [[H3117]]
