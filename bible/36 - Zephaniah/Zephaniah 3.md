### 1
Woe [[H1945]] to the city [[H5892]] of oppressors, [[H3238]] rebellious [[H4754]] and defiled! [[H1351]]

### 2
She heeded [[H8085]] no [[H3808]] voice; [[H6963]] she accepted [[H3947]] no [[H3808]] instruction. [[H4148]] She does not [[H3808]] trust [[H982]] in the LORD; [[H3068]] she has not [[H3808]] drawn near [[H7126]] to [[H413]] her God. [[H430]]

### 3
Her princes [[H8269]] are roaring [[H7580]] lions; [[H738]] her judges [are] [[H8199]] evening [[H6153]] wolves, [[H2061]] leaving [[H1633]] nothing [[H3808]] for the morning. [[H1242]]

### 4
Her prophets [[H5030]] are reckless, [[H6348]] faithless [[H900]] men. [[H582]] Her priests [[H3548]] profane [[H2490]] the sanctuary; [[H6944]] they do violence to [[H2554]] the law. [[H8451]]

### 5
The LORD [[H3068]] within her [[H7130]] is righteous; [[H6662]] He does [[H6213]] no [[H3808]] wrong. [[H5766]] He applies [[H5414]] His justice [[H4941]] morning [[H1242]] by morning; [[H1242]] He does not [[H3808]] fail [[H5737]] at dawn, [[H216]] yet the unjust [[H5767]] knows [[H3045]] no [[H3808]] shame. [[H1322]]

### 6
“I have cut off [[H3772]] the nations; [[H1471]] their corner towers [[H6438]] are destroyed. [[H8074]] I have made [[H2717]] their streets {deserted} [[H2351]] with no one [[H1097]] to pass through. [[H5674]] Their cities [[H5892]] are laid waste, [[H6658]] with no [[H1097]] man, [[H376]] no [[H369]] inhabitant. [[H3427]]

### 7
I said, [[H559]] ‘Surely [[H389]] you will fear [[H3372]] Me [[H853]] and accept [[H3947]] correction.’ [[H4148]] Then her dwelling place [[H4585]] would not [[H3808]] be cut off [[H3772]] [despite] all [[H3605]] for which [[H834]] I punished [[H6485]] her. [[H5921]] But [[H403]] they rose early [[H7925]] to corrupt [[H7843]] all [[H3605]] their deeds. [[H5949]]

### 8
Therefore [[H3651]] wait [[H2442]] for Me,”  declares [[H5002]] the LORD, [[H3068]] “until the day [[H3117]] I rise [[H6965]] to testify. [[H5706]] For [[H3588]] My decision [[H4941]] is to gather [[H622]] nations, [[H1471]] to assemble [[H6908]] kingdoms, [[H4467]] to pour out [[H8210]] upon them [[H5921]] My indignation, [[H2195]] all [[H3605]] My burning anger. [[H2740]] For [[H3588]] all [[H3605]] the earth [[H776]] will be consumed [[H398]] by the fire [[H784]] of My jealousy. [[H7068]]

### 9
For [[H3588]] then [[H227]] I will restore [[H2015]] pure [[H1305]] lips [[H8193]] to [[H413]] the peoples, [[H5971]] that all [[H3605]] may call [[H7121]] upon the name [[H8034]] of the LORD [[H3068]] and serve Him [[H5647]] shoulder [[H7926]] to shoulder. [[H259]]

### 10
From beyond [[H5676]] the rivers [[H5104]] of Cush [[H3568]] My worshipers, [[H6282]] My scattered [[H6327]] people, [[H1323]] will bring Me [[H2986]] an offering. [[H4503]]

### 11
On that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] you will not [[H3808]] be put to shame [[H954]] for any [[H3605]] of the deeds [[H5949]] by which [[H834]] you transgress [[H6586]] against Me.  For [[H3588]] then [[H227]] I will remove [[H5493]] from among you [[H7130]] those who rejoice [[H5947]] in their pride, [[H1346]] and you will never [[H3808]] again [[H3254]] be haughty [[H1361]] on My holy [[H6944]] mountain. [[H2022]]

### 12
But I will leave [[H7604]] within you [[H7130]] a meek [[H6041]] and humble [[H1800]] people, [[H5971]] and they will trust [[H2620]] in the name [[H8034]] of the LORD. [[H3068]]

### 13
The remnant [[H7611]] of Israel [[H3478]] will no longer [[H3808]] do [[H6213]] wrong [[H5766]] [or] [[H3808]] speak [[H1696]] lies, [[H3577]] nor will [[H3808]] a deceitful [[H8649]] tongue [[H3956]] be found [[H4672]] in their mouths. [[H6310]] But [[H3588]] they [[H1992]] will feed [[H7462]] and lie down, [[H7257]] with no one [[H369]] to make them tremble.” [[H2729]]

### 14
Sing for joy, [[H7442]] O daughter [[H1323]] of Zion; [[H6726]] shout aloud, [[H7321]] O Israel! [[H3478]] Be glad [[H8055]] and rejoice [[H5937]] with all [[H3605]] your heart, [[H3820]] O daughter [[H1323]] of Jerusalem! [[H3389]]

### 15
The LORD [[H3068]] has taken away [[H5493]] your punishment; [[H4941]] He has turned back [[H6437]] your enemy. [[H341]] Israel's [[H3478]] King, [[H4428]] the LORD, [[H3068]] is among you; [[H7130]] no [[H3808]] longer [[H5750]] will you fear [[H3372]] any harm. [[H7451]]

### 16
On that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] they will say [[H559]] to Jerusalem: [[H3389]] “Do not [[H408]] fear, [[H3372]] O Zion; [[H6726]] do not [[H408]] let your hands [[H3027]] fall limp. [[H7503]]

### 17
The LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] is among you; [[H7130]] He is mighty [[H1368]] to save. [[H3467]] He will rejoice [[H7797]] over you [[H5921]] with gladness; [[H8057]] He will quiet [you] [[H2790]] with His love; [[H160]] He will rejoice [[H1523]] over you [[H5921]] with singing.” [[H7440]]

### 18
“I will gather [[H622]] those among you [[H4480]] who grieve [[H3013]] over the appointed feasts, [[H4150]] so that [[H1961]] you will no longer suffer [[H4864]] reproach. [[H2781]]

### 19
Behold, [[H2005]] at that [[H1931]] time, [[H6256]] I will deal [[H6213]] with all [[H3605]] who afflict you. [[H6031]] I will save [[H3467]] the lame [[H6760]] and gather [[H6908]] the scattered; [[H5080]] and I will appoint [[H7760]] praise [[H8416]] and fame [[H8034]] for the disgraced [[H1322]] throughout [[H3605]] the earth. [[H776]]

### 20
At that [[H1931]] time [[H6256]] I will bring you in; [[H935]] yes, at the time [[H6256]] I will gather you. [[H6908]] For [[H3588]] I will give [[H5414]] you [[H853]] fame [[H8034]] and praise [[H8416]] among all [[H3605]] the peoples [[H5971]] of the earth [[H776]] when I restore [[H7725]] your fortunes [[H7622]] before your eyes,” [[H5869]] says [[H559]] the LORD.
