### 1
Rid yourselves, [[G659]] therefore, [[G3767]] {of} all [[G3956]] malice, [[G2549]] deceit, [[G1388]] hypocrisy, [[G5272]] envy, [[G5355]] and [[G2532]] slander. [[G2636]]

### 2
Like [[G5613]] newborn [[G738]] infants, [[G1025]] crave [[G1971]] pure [[G97]] spiritual [[G3050]] milk, [[G1051]] so that [[G2443]] by [[G1722]] it [[G846]] you may grow up [[G837]] in [your] [[G1519]] salvation, [[G4991]]

### 3
now that [[G1487]] you have tasted [[G1089]] that [[G3754]] the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] [is] good. [[G5543]]

### 4
As you come [[G4334]] to [[G4314]] [Him], [[G3739]] [the] living [[G2198]] stone, [[G3037]] rejected [[G593]] by [[G5259]] men, [[G444]] but [[G1161]] chosen [[G1588]] [and] precious [[G1784]] in God’s [[G2316]] sight, [[G3844]]

### 5
you [[G846]] also, [[G2532]] like [[G5613]] living [[G2198]] stones, [[G3037]] are being built into [[G3618]] a spiritual [[G4152]] house [[G3624]] to [be] [[G1519]] a holy [[G40]] priesthood, [[G2406]] offering [[G399]] spiritual [[G4152]] sacrifices [[G2378]] acceptable [[G2144]] to God [[G2316]] through [[G1223]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ. [[G5547]]

### 6
For [[G1360]] it stands [[G4023]] in [[G1722]] Scripture: [[G1124]] “See, [[G2400]] I lay [[G5087]] in [[G1722]] Zion [[G4622]] a stone, [[G3037]] a chosen [[G1588]] [and] precious [[G1784]] cornerstone; [[G204]] and [[G2532]] the [one who] [[G3588]] believes [[G4100]] in [[G1909]] Him [[G846]] will never be put to shame.” [[G2617]]

### 7
To you [[G4771]] who [[G3588]] believe, [[G4100]] then, [[G3767]] [this stone] [[G3588]] is precious. [[G5092]] But [[G1161]] [to those who] do not believe, [[G569]] “[The] stone [[G3037]] the [[G3588]] builders [[G3618]] rejected [[G593]] has become [[G1096]] the cornerstone,” [[G1137]]

### 8
and, [[G2532]] “A stone [[G3037]] of stumbling [[G4348]] and [[G2532]] a rock [[G4073]] of offense.” [[G4625]] [They] [[G3739]] stumble [because] [[G4350]] they disobey [[G544]] the [[G3588]] message— [[G3056]] and [[G2532]] to [[G1519]] [this] [[G3739]] they were appointed. [[G5087]]

### 9
But [[G1161]] you [[G4771]] [are] a chosen [[G1588]] people, [[G1085]] a royal [[G934]] priesthood, [[G2406]] a holy [[G40]] nation, [[G1484]] a people [[G2992]] for [God’s own] [[G1519]] possession, [[G4047]] to [[G3704]] proclaim [[G1804]] the [[G3588]] virtues [[G703]] of Him who [[G3588]] called [[G2564]] you [[G4771]] out of [[G1537]] darkness [[G4655]] into [[G1519]] His [[G846]] marvelous [[G2298]] light. [[G5457]]

### 10
Once [[G4218]] [you were] [[G3739]] not [[G3756]] a people, [[G2992]] but [[G1161]] now [you are] [[G3568]] [the] people [[G2992]] of God; [[G2316]] [once you] [[G3588]] had not received mercy, [[G1653]] but [[G1161]] now [[G3568]] you have received mercy. [[G1653]]

### 11
Beloved, [[G27]] I urge [you], [[G3870]] as [[G5613]] foreigners [[G3941]] and [[G2532]] exiles, [[G3927]] to abstain [[G568]] from [[G3588]] [the] desires [[G1939]] of the flesh, [[G4559]] which [[G3748]] war [[G4754]] against [[G2596]] [your] [[G3588]] soul. [[G5590]]

### 12
Conduct [[G2192]] yourselves [[G4771]] with such honor [[G2570]] among [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] Gentiles [[G1484]] that, [[G2443]] though [[G3739]] they slander [[G2635]] you [[G4771]] as [[G5613]] evildoers, [[G2555]] they may see [[G2029]] [your] [[G3588]] good [[G2570]] deeds [[G2041]] [and] glorify [[G1392]] God [[G2316]] on [[G1722]] [the] day [[G2250]] He visits us. [[G1984]]

### 13
Submit yourselves [[G5293]] for the [[G3588]] Lord’s [[G2962]] sake [[G1223]] to every [[G3956]] human [[G442]] institution, [[G2937]] whether [[G1535]] to [the] king [[G935]] as [[G5613]] the supreme [authority], [[G5242]]

### 14
or [[G1535]] to governors [[G2232]] as [[G5613]] those sent [[G3992]] by [[G1223]] him [[G846]] to [[G1519]] punish [[G1557]] evildoers [[G2555]] and [[G1161]] praise [[G1868]] well-doers. [[G17]]

### 15
For [[G3754]] it is [[G1510]] God’s [[G2316]] will [[G2307]] that [[G3779]] by doing good [[G15]] you should silence [[G5392]] the [[G3588]] ignorance [[G56]] of foolish [[G878]] men. [[G444]]

### 16
[Live] [[G5613]] in freedom, [[G1658]] [but] [[G2532]] do not use [[G2192]] [your] [[G3588]] freedom [[G1657]] as [[G5613]] a cover-up [[G1942]] for [[G3588]] evil; [[G2549]] [live] as [[G5613]] servants [[G1401]] of God. [[G2316]]

### 17
Treat everyone with high regard: [[G5091]] Love [[G25]] the [[G3588]] brotherhood [of believers], [[G81]] fear [[G5399]] God, [[G2316]] honor [[G5091]] the [[G3588]] king. [[G935]]

### 18
Servants, [[G3610]] submit yourselves [[G5293]] to [your] [[G3588]] masters [[G1203]] with [[G1722]] all [[G3956]] respect, [[G5401]] not [[G3756]] only [[G3440]] to those who [are] [[G3588]] good [[G18]] and [[G2532]] gentle, [[G1933]] but [[G235]] even [[G2532]] to those who [are] [[G3588]] unreasonable. [[G4646]]

### 19
For [[G1063]] if [[G1487]] anyone [[G5100]] endures [[G5297]] the pain [[G3077]] of unjust [[G95]] suffering [[G3958]] because [[G1223]] he is conscious [[G4893]] of God, [[G2316]] this [[G3778]] is to be commended. [[G5485]]

### 20
How [[G4169]] is it to your credit [[G2811]] if [[G1487]] you are beaten [[G2852]] for doing wrong [[G264]] and [[G2532]] you endure [it]? [[G5278]] But [[G235]] if [[G1487]] you suffer [[G3958]] for doing good [[G15]] [and] you endure [it], [[G5278]] this [is] [[G3778]] commendable [[G5485]] before [[G3844]] God. [[G2316]]

### 21
For [[G1063]] to this [[G1519]] you were called, [[G2564]] because [[G3754]] Christ [[G5547]] also [[G2532]] suffered [[G3958]] for [[G5228]] you, [[G4771]] leaving [[G5277]] you [[G4771]] an example, [[G5261]] that [[G2443]] you should follow in [[G1872]] His [[G846]] footsteps: [[G2487]]

### 22
“He [[G3739]] committed [[G4160]] no [[G3756]] sin, [[G266]] [and] no [[G3761]] deceit [[G1388]] was found [[G2147]] in [[G1722]] His [[G846]] mouth.” [[G4750]]

### 23
When they heaped abuse on Him, [[G3058]] He did not retaliate; [[G486]] when He suffered, [[G3958]] He made no threats, [[G546]] but [[G1161]] entrusted Himself [[G3860]] to Him who [[G3588]] judges [[G2919]] justly. [[G1346]]

### 24
[He] [[G3739]] Himself [[G846]] bore [[G399]] our [[G1473]] sins [[G266]] in [[G1722]] His [[G846]] body [[G4983]] on [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] tree, [[G3586]] so that [[G2443]] we might die [[G581]] to sin [[G266]] [and] live [[G2198]] to righteousness. [[G1343]] “By [His] [[G3739]] stripes [[G3468]] you are healed.” [[G2390]]

### 25
For [[G1063]] you were [[G1510]] like [[G5613]] sheep [[G4263]] going astray, [[G4105]] but [[G235]] now [[G3568]] you have returned [[G1994]] to [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] Shepherd [[G4166]] and [[G2532]] Overseer [[G1985]] of [[G3588]] your [[G4771]] souls. [[G5590]]
