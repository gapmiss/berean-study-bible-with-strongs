### 1
Wives, [[G1135]] in the same way, [[G3668]] submit yourselves [[G5293]] to [your] [[G3588]] husbands, [[G435]] so that [[G2443]] even [[G2532]] if [[G1487]] [they] [[G5100]] refuse to believe [[G544]] the [[G3588]] word, [[G3056]] they will be won over [[G2770]] without [[G427]] words [[G3056]] by [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] behavior [[G391]] of [their] [[G3588]] wives [[G1135]]

### 2
when they see [[G2029]] your [[G4771]] pure [[G53]] [and] reverent [[G5401]] demeanor. [[G391]]

### 3
[Your beauty] [[G3739]] {should} not [[G3756]] come [[G1510]] [from] [[G3588]] outward [[G1855]] adornment [[G2889]] [such as] braided [[G1708]] hair [[G2359]] or [[G2532]] gold [jewelry] [[G5553]] or [[G2228]] fine clothes, [[G2440]]

### 4
but [[G235]] from the [[G3588]] inner [[G2927]] disposition [[G444]] of [your] [[G3588]] heart, [[G2588]] the [[G3588]] unfading [ beauty ] [[G862]] of a [[G3588]] gentle [[G4239]] and [[G2532]] quiet [[G2272]] spirit, [[G4151]] which [[G3739]] is [[G1510]] precious [[G4185]] in God’s [[G2316]] sight. [[G1799]]

### 5
For [[G1063]] this is how [[G3779]] the [[G3588]] holy [[G40]] women [[G1135]] of the past [[G4218]] adorned [[G2885]] themselves. [[G1438]] They put their hope [[G1679]] in [[G1519]] God [[G2316]] [and] were subject [[G5293]] to [[G3588]] [their] [[G2398]] husbands, [[G435]]

### 6
just as [[G5613]] Sarah [[G4564]] obeyed [[G5219]] Abraham [[G11]] [and] called [[G2564]] him [[G846]] lord. [[G2962]] You are [[G1096]] [her] [[G3739]] children [[G5043]] if you do what is right [[G15]] and [[G2532]] refuse [[G3361]] to quiver [[G4423]] in fear. [[G5399]]

### 7
Husbands, [[G435]] in the same way, [[G3668]] treat [[G4924]] [your] [[G3588]] wives [[G1134]] {with} [[G2596]] consideration [[G1108]] as [[G5613]] a delicate [[G772]] vessel, [[G4632]] and [[G2532]] {with} honor [[G5092]] as [[G5613]] fellow heirs [[G4789]] of [the] gracious gift [[G5485]] of life, [[G2222]] so that [[G1519]] your [[G4771]] prayers [[G4335]] will not be hindered. [[G1465]]

### 8
Finally, [[G5056]] all [of you], [[G3956]] [be] like-minded [[G3675]] [and] sympathetic, [[G4835]] love as brothers, [[G5361]] [be] tender-hearted [[G2155]] [and] humble. [[G5012]]

### 9
Do not repay [[G591]] evil [[G2556]] with [[G473]] evil [[G2556]] or [[G2228]] insult [[G3059]] with [[G473]] insult, [[G3059]] but [[G1161]] with blessing, [[G2127]] because [[G3754]] to [[G1519]] this [[G3778]] you were called [[G2564]] so that [[G2443]] you may inherit [[G2816]] a blessing. [[G2129]]

### 10
For, [[G1063]] “Whoever [[G3588]] would [[G2309]] love [[G25]] life [[G2222]] and [[G2532]] see [[G3708]] good [[G18]] days [[G2250]] must keep [[G3973]] [his] [[G3588]] tongue [[G1100]] from [[G575]] evil [[G2556]] and [[G2532]] [his] lips [[G5491]] [from] [[G3361]] deceitful [[G1388]] speech. [[G2980]]

### 11
He must turn away [[G1578]] from [[G575]] evil [[G2556]] and [[G2532]] do [[G4160]] good; [[G18]] he must seek [[G2212]] peace [[G1515]] and [[G2532]] pursue [[G1377]] it. [[G846]]

### 12
For [[G3754]] [the] eyes [[G3788]] of [the] Lord [[G2962]] [are] on [[G1909]] [the] righteous, [[G1342]] and [[G2532]] His [[G846]] ears [[G3775]] are inclined to [[G1519]] their [[G846]] prayer. [[G1162]] But [[G1161]] [the] face [[G4383]] of [the] Lord [[G2962]] [is] against [[G1909]] those who do [[G4160]] evil.” [[G2556]]

### 13
Who [[G5101]] will harm [[G2559]] you [[G4771]] if [[G1437]] you are [[G1096]] zealous [[G2207]] for what [is] [[G3588]] good? [[G18]]

### 14
But [[G235]] even [[G2532]] if [[G1487]] you should suffer [[G3958]] for [[G1223]] what is right, [[G1343]] [you are] blessed. [[G3107]] “Do not fear [[G5399]] their [[G846]] intimidation; [[G5401]] do not be shaken.” [[G5015]]

### 15
But [[G1161]] in [[G1722]] your [[G4771]] hearts [[G2588]] sanctify [[G37]] Christ [[G5547]] [as] Lord. [[G2962]] Always [[G104]] be prepared [[G2092]] to [[G4314]] give a defense [[G627]] to everyone [[G3956]] who [[G3588]] asks [[G154]] you [[G4771]] the reason [[G3056]] for [[G4012]] the [[G3588]] hope [[G1680]] you possess. [[G4771]] But [respond] [[G235]] with [[G3326]] gentleness [[G4240]] and [[G2532]] respect, [[G5401]]

### 16
keeping [[G2192]] a clear [[G18]] conscience, [[G4893]] so that [[G2443]] those who slander you [[G2635]] will be put to shame [[G2617]] by your [[G4771]] good [[G18]] behavior [[G391]] in [[G1722]] Christ. [[G5547]]

### 17
For [[G1063]] [it is] better, [[G2909]] if [[G1487]] [it is] [[G2309]] God’s [[G2316]] will, [[G2307]] to suffer [[G3958]] [for] doing good [[G15]] than [[G2228]] for doing evil. [[G2554]]

### 18
For [[G3754]] Christ [[G5547]] also [[G2532]] suffered [[G3958]] for [[G4012]] sins [[G266]] once for all, [[G530]] [the] righteous [[G1342]] for [[G5228]] [the] unrighteous, [[G94]] to [[G2443]] bring [[G4317]] you [[G4771]] to God. [[G2316]] He was put to death [[G2289]] in [the] body [[G4561]] but [[G1161]] made alive [[G2227]] in [the] spirit, [[G4151]]

### 19
in [[G1722]] which [[G3739]] He also went [[G4198]] [and] preached [[G2784]] to the [[G3588]] spirits [[G4151]] in [[G1722]] prison [[G5438]]

### 20
who disobeyed [[G544]] long ago [[G4218]] when [[G3753]] God [[G2316]] waited [[G553]] patiently [[G3115]] in [[G1722]] [the] days [[G2250]] of Noah, [[G3575]] [while the] ark [[G2787]] was being built. [[G2680]] In [[G1519]] [the ark] [[G3739]] a few [people], [[G3641]] [only] [[G3778]] eight [[G3638]] souls, [[G5590]] were saved [[G1295]] through [[G1223]] water. [[G5204]]

### 21
And [[G2532]] [this water] [[G3739]] symbolizes [[G499]] [the] baptism [[G908]] [that] now [[G3568]] saves [[G4982]] you— [[G4771]] not [[G3756]] the removal [[G595]] of dirt [[G4509]] from the body, [[G4561]] but [[G235]] [the] pledge [[G1906]] of a clear [[G18]] conscience [[G4893]] toward [[G1519]] God. [[G2316]] [It saves you] through [[G1223]] [the] resurrection [[G386]] of Jesus [[G2424]] Christ, [[G5547]]

### 22
who [[G3739]] has gone [[G4198]] into [[G1519]] heaven [[G3772]] [and] is [[G1510]] at [[G1722]] [the] right hand [[G1188]] of God, [[G2316]] [with] angels, [[G32]] authorities, [[G1849]] and [[G2532]] powers [[G1411]] subject [[G5293]] to Him. [[G846]]
