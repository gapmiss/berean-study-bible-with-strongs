Peter, [[G4074]] an apostle [[G652]] of Jesus [[G2424]] Christ, [[G5547]] To [the] elect, [[G1588]] exiles [[G3927]] of [the] Dispersion [[G1290]] [throughout] Pontus, [[G4195]] Galatia, [[G1053]] Cappadocia, [[G2587]] Asia, [[G773]] and [[G2532]] Bithynia, [[G978]]

###### 2
chosen by [[G2596]] [the] foreknowledge [[G4268]] of God [[G2316]] [the] Father [[G3962]] [and] sanctified [[G38]] by [[G1722]] [the] Spirit [[G4151]] for [[G1519]] obedience [[G5218]] to Jesus [[G2424]] Christ [[G5547]] and [[G2532]] sprinkling [[G4473]] by [His] blood: [[G129]] Grace [[G5485]] and [[G2532]] peace [[G1515]] be yours [[G4771]] in abundance. [[G4129]]

###### 3
Blessed [be] [[G2128]] the [[G3588]] God [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] Father [[G3962]] of our [[G1473]] Lord [[G2962]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ! [[G5547]] By [[G2596]] His [[G846]] great [[G4183]] mercy [[G1656]] [He] [[G3588]] has given us new birth [[G313]] into [[G1519]] a living [[G2198]] hope [[G1680]] through [[G1223]] [the] resurrection [[G386]] of Jesus [[G2424]] Christ [[G5547]] from [[G1537]] [the] dead, [[G3498]]

###### 4
[and] into [[G1519]] an inheritance [that is] [[G2817]] imperishable, [[G862]] undefiled, [[G283]] and [[G2532]] unfading, [[G263]] reserved [[G5083]] in [[G1722]] heaven [[G3772]] for [[G1519]] you, [[G4771]]

###### 5
who [[G3588]] through [[G1223]] faith [[G4102]] [are] protected [[G5432]] by [[G1722]] God’s [[G2316]] power [[G1411]] for [[G1519]] [the] salvation [[G4991]] [that is] ready [[G2092]] to be revealed [[G601]] in [[G1722]] [the] last [[G2078]] time. [[G2540]]

###### 6
In [[G1722]] this [[G3739]] you greatly rejoice, [[G21]] though [[G1487]] now [[G737]] for a little while [[G3641]] you may [[G1510]] have had [[G1163]] to suffer grief [[G3076]] in [[G1722]] various [[G4164]] trials, [[G3986]]

###### 7
so that [[G2443]] the [[G3588]] authenticity [[G1383]] of your [[G4771]] faith— [[G4102]] more precious [[G4186]] than gold, [[G5553]] which [[G3588]] perishes [[G622]] even though [[G1161]] refined [[G1381]] by [[G1223]] fire— [[G4442]] may result in [[G2147]] praise, [[G1868]] glory, [[G1391]] and [[G2532]] honor [[G5092]] at [[G1722]] [the] revelation [[G602]] of Jesus [[G2424]] Christ. [[G5547]]

###### 8
[Though] you have not seen [[G3708]] [Him], [[G3739]] you love [Him]; [[G25]] [and though] you do not see [[G3708]] [Him] [[G3739]] now, [[G737]] you believe [[G4100]] in [Him] [[G1519]] and [[G1161]] rejoice [[G21]] with an inexpressible [[G412]] and [[G2532]] glorious [[G1392]] joy, [[G5479]]

###### 9
[now that] you are receiving [[G2865]] the [[G3588]] goal [[G5056]] of [[G3588]] your [[G4771]] faith, [[G4102]] [the] salvation [[G4991]] of [your] souls. [[G5590]]

###### 10
Concerning [[G4012]] this [[G3739]] salvation, [[G4991]] [the] prophets [[G4396]] who [[G3588]] foretold [[G4395]] the [[G3588]] grace [[G5485]] that would come [[G1519]] to you [[G4771]] searched [[G1567]] and [[G2532]] investigated carefully, [[G1830]]

###### 11
trying to determine [[G2045]] the time and setting [[G5101]] to which the [[G3588]] Spirit [[G4151]] of Christ [[G5547]] in [[G1722]] them [[G846]] was pointing [[G1213]] when He predicted [[G4303]] the [[G3588]] sufferings [[G3804]] of [[G1519]] Christ [[G5547]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] glories [[G1391]] to follow. [[G3778]]

###### 12
It was revealed [[G601]] to [them] [[G3739]] that [[G3754]] they were not serving [[G1247]] themselves [[G1438]] but [[G1161]] you, [[G4771]] [when they foretold] the things [[G846]] now announced [[G312]] by [[G1223]] those who [[G3588]] preached the gospel [[G2097]] to you [[G4771]] by [[G1722]] [the] Holy [[G40]] Spirit [[G4151]] sent [[G649]] from [[G575]] heaven. [[G3772]] [Even] angels [[G32]] long [[G1937]] to look [[G3879]] into [[G1519]] [these things]. [[G3739]]

###### 13
Therefore [[G1352]] prepare [[G328]] your [[G4771]] minds {for action}. [[G1271]] Be sober-minded. [[G3525]] Set [your] hope [[G1679]] fully [[G5049]] on [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] grace [[G5485]] to be given [[G5342]] you [[G4771]] at [[G1722]] [the] revelation [[G602]] of Jesus [[G2424]] Christ. [[G5547]]

###### 14
As [[G5613]] obedient [[G5218]] children, [[G5043]] do not conform [[G4964]] to the [[G3588]] passions [[G1939]] of [[G1722]] your [[G4771]] former [[G4386]] ignorance. [[G52]]

###### 15
But [[G235]] just as [[G2596]] He who [[G3588]] called [[G2564]] you [[G4771]] [is] holy, [[G40]] so [[G2532]] be [[G1096]] holy [[G40]] in [[G1722]] all [[G3956]] you do, [[G391]]

###### 16
for [[G1360]] it is written: [[G1125]] “Be [[G1510]] holy, [[G40]] because [[G3754]] I [[G1473]] am [[G1510]] holy.” [[G40]]

###### 17
Since [[G1487]] you call on [[G1941]] [a] Father [[G3962]] who [[G3588]] judges [[G2919]] each one’s [[G1538]] work [[G2041]] impartially, [[G678]] live your lives [[G390]] in [[G1722]] reverent fear [[G5401]] during [[G3588]] your [[G4771]] temporary stay [on earth]. [[G5550]]

###### 18
[For] you know [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] it was not with perishable things [[G5349]] [such as] silver [[G694]] or [[G2228]] gold [[G5553]] that you were redeemed [[G3084]] from [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] empty [[G3152]] way of life [[G391]] you [[G4771]] inherited from your forefathers, [[G3970]]

###### 19
but [[G235]] with [the] precious [[G5093]] blood [[G129]] of Christ, [[G5547]] a lamb [[G286]] without blemish [[G299]] [or] [[G2532]] spot. [[G784]]

###### 20
He was known before [[G4267]] [the] foundation [[G2602]] of [the] world, [[G2889]] but [[G1161]] was revealed [[G5319]] in [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] last [[G2078]] times [[G5550]] for your sake. [[G1223]]

###### 21
Through [[G1223]] Him [[G846]] [you] [[G3588]] believe [[G4103]] in [[G1519]] God, [[G2316]] who [[G3588]] raised Him [[G1453]] from [[G1537]] [the] dead [[G3498]] and [[G2532]] glorified [[G1391]] Him; [[G846]] and so [[G5620]] your [[G4771]] faith [[G4102]] and [[G2532]] hope [[G1680]] are [[G1510]] in [[G1519]] God. [[G2316]]

###### 22
[Since] you have purified [[G48]] your [[G4771]] souls [[G5590]] by [[G1722]] obedience [[G5218]] to the [[G3588]] truth [[G225]] so that [[G1519]] you have a genuine love for your brothers, [[G5360]] love [[G25]] one another [[G240]] deeply, [[G1619]] from [[G1537]] a pure [[G2513]] heart. [[G2588]]

###### 23
For you have been born again, [[G313]] not [[G3756]] of [[G1537]] perishable [[G5349]] seed, [[G4701]] but [[G235]] of imperishable, [[G862]] through [[G1223]] [the] living [[G2198]] and [[G2532]] enduring [[G3306]] word [[G3056]] of God. [[G2316]]

###### 24
For, [[G1360]] “All [[G3956]] flesh [is] [[G4561]] like [[G5613]] grass, [[G5528]] and [[G2532]] all [[G3956]] its [[G846]] glory [[G1391]] like [[G5613]] [the] flowers [[G438]] of the field; [[G5528]] the [[G3588]] grass [[G5528]] withers [[G3583]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] flowers [[G438]] fall, [[G1601]]

###### 25
but [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] word [[G4487]] of [the] Lord [[G2962]] stands [[G3306]] forever.” [[G165]] And [[G1161]] this [[G3778]] is [[G1510]] the [[G3588]] word [[G4487]] that [[G3588]] was proclaimed [[G2097]] to [[G1519]] you. [[G4771]]
