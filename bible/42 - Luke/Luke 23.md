### 1
Then [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] whole [[G537]] council [[G4128]] rose [[G450]] [and] led [[G71]] [Jesus] {away} [[G846]] to [[G1909]] Pilate. [[G4091]]

### 2
And [[G1161]] they began [[G756]] to accuse [[G2723]] Him, [[G846]] saying, [[G3004]] “We found [[G2147]] this [man] [[G3778]] subverting [[G1294]] our [[G1473]] nation, [[G1484]] forbidding [[G2967]] payment of taxes [[G5411]] to Caesar, [[G2541]] and [[G2532]] proclaiming [[G3004]] Himself [[G1438]] to be [[G1510]] Christ, [[G5547]] a king.” [[G935]]

### 3
So [[G1161]] Pilate [[G4091]] asked [[G2065]] Him, [[G846]] “Are [[G1510]] You [[G4771]] the [[G3588]] King [[G935]] of the [[G3588]] Jews?” [[G2453]] “You [[G4771]] have said [so],” [[G3004]] [Jesus] replied. [[G611]]

### 4
Then [[G1161]] Pilate [[G4091]] said [[G2036]] to [[G4314]] the [[G3588]] chief priests [[G749]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] crowds, [[G3793]] “I find [[G2147]] no [[G3762]] basis for a charge [[G159]] against [[G1722]] this [[G3778]] man.” [[G444]]

### 5
But [[G1161]] they kept insisting, [[G2001]] “He stirs up [[G383]] the [[G3588]] people [[G2992]] all [[G3650]] over [[G2596]] Judea [[G2449]] [with His] teaching. [[G1321]] He began [[G756]] in [[G575]] Galilee [[G1056]] [and has come] all the way [[G2193]] here.” [[G5602]]

### 6
When [[G1161]] Pilate [[G4091]] heard [this], [[G191]] he asked [[G1905]] if [[G1487]] the [[G3588]] man [[G444]] was [[G1510]] a Galilean. [[G1057]]

### 7
And [[G2532]] learning [[G1921]] that [[G3754]] [Jesus] was [[G1510]] under [[G1537]] Herod’s [[G2264]] jurisdiction, [[G1849]] he sent Him [[G375]] to [[G4314]] Herod, [[G2264]] [who] himself [[G846]] was [[G1510]] in [[G1722]] Jerusalem [[G2414]] at [[G1722]] that [[G3778]] time. [[G2250]]

### 8
When [[G1161]] Herod [[G2264]] saw [[G3708]] Jesus, [[G2424]] he was [[G1510]] greatly [[G3029]] pleased. [[G5463]] He had wanted [[G2309]] to see [[G3708]] Him [[G846]] for [[G1537]] a long [[G2425]] time, [[G5550]] because [[G1223]] he had heard [[G191]] about [[G4012]] Him [[G846]] and [[G2532]] was hoping [[G1679]] to see [[G3708]] Him [[G846]] perform [[G1096]] a [[G5100]] miracle. [[G4592]]

### 9
[Herod] questioned [[G1905]] [Jesus] [[G846]] at [[G1722]] great [[G2425]] [length], [[G3056]] but [[G1161]] He [[G846]] gave no answer. [[G611]]

### 10
Meanwhile, [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] chief priests [[G749]] and [[G2532]] scribes [[G1122]] stood there, [[G2476]] vehemently [[G2159]] accusing [[G2723]] Him. [[G846]]

### 11
And [[G1161]] even [[G2532]] Herod [[G2264]] and [[G4862]] his [[G846]] soldiers [[G4753]] ridiculed [[G1848]] and [[G2532]] mocked [Him]. [[G1702]] Dressing [Him] in [[G4016]] a fine [[G2986]] robe, [[G2066]] they sent Him back [[G375]] to [[G3588]] Pilate. [[G4091]]

### 12
That [[G846]] day [[G2250]] Herod [[G2264]] and [[G2532]] Pilate [[G4091]] became [[G1096]] friends; [[G5384]] before this [time] [[G4391]] they had been [[G1510]] enemies. [[G2189]]

### 13
Then [[G1161]] Pilate [[G4091]] called together [[G4779]] the [[G3588]] chief priests, [[G749]] the [[G3588]] rulers, [[G758]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] people, [[G2992]]

### 14
[and] said [[G2036]] to [[G4314]] them, [[G846]] “You brought [[G4374]] me [[G1473]] this [[G3778]] man [[G444]] as [one who] [[G5613]] was inciting [[G654]] the [[G3588]] people {to rebellion}. [[G2992]] I [[G1473]] have examined [Him] [[G350]] here [[G2400]] in your presence [[G1799]] [and] found [[G2147]] [Him] [[G444]] not [[G3762]] guilty [[G159]] of [[G3739]] your charges [[G2723]] against [[G2596]] Him. [[G846]]

### 15
Neither [has] [[G3761]] Herod, [[G2264]] for [[G1063]] he sent Him back [[G375]] to [[G4314]] us. [[G1473]] As you can see, [[G2400]] He [[G846]] has [[G1510]] done [[G4238]] nothing [[G3762]] deserving [[G514]] of death. [[G2288]]

### 16
Therefore [[G3767]] I will punish [[G3811]] Him [[G846]] [and] release [Him].” [[G630]]

### 17
Now [[G1161]] of necessity [[G318]] he had [[G2192]] to release [[G630]] to them [[G846]] one [[G1520]] at [[G2596]] [the] feast. [[G1859]]

### 18
But [[G1161]] they all cried out [[G349]] in unison: [[G3826]] “Away with [[G142]] this [man]! [[G3778]] Release [[G630]] Barabbas [[G912]] to us!” [[G1473]]

### 19
([Barabbas] [[G3748]] had been imprisoned [[G906]] for [[G1223]] an [[G5100]] insurrection [[G4714]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] city, [[G4172]] and [[G2532]] for murder.) [[G5408]]

### 20
Wanting [[G2309]] to release [[G630]] Jesus, [[G2424]] Pilate [[G4091]] addressed [[G4377]] them [[G846]] again, [[G3825]]

### 21
but [[G1161]] they kept shouting, [[G2019]] “Crucify [Him]! [[G4717]] Crucify [[G4717]] Him!” [[G846]]

### 22
A third [time] [[G5154]] he said [[G2036]] to [[G4314]] them, [[G846]] “What [[G5101]] evil [[G2556]] {has} this [man] [[G3778]] done? [[G4160]] I have found [[G2147]] in [[G1722]] Him [[G846]] no [[G3762]] offense worthy [[G159]] of death. [[G2288]] So [[G3767]] after I punish [[G3811]] Him, [[G846]] I will release [Him].” [[G630]]

### 23
But [[G1161]] they were insistent, [[G1945]] demanding [[G154]] with loud voices [[G5456]] for [Jesus] [[G846]] to be crucified. [[G4717]] And [[G2532]] their [[G846]] clamor [[G5456]] prevailed. [[G2729]]

### 24
So [[G2532]] Pilate [[G4091]] sentenced [that] [[G1948]] their [[G846]] demand [[G155]] be met. [[G1096]]

### 25
As [[G1161]] they had requested, [[G154]] he released [[G630]] the [one] [[G3588]] imprisoned [[G906]] for [[G1223]] insurrection [[G4714]] and [[G2532]] murder, [[G5408]] and [[G1161]] surrendered [[G3860]] Jesus [[G2424]] to [[G3588]] their [[G846]] will. [[G2307]]

### 26
As [[G5613]] [the soldiers] led Him away, [[G520]] they seized [[G1949]] Simon [[G4613]] of Cyrene [[G2956]] on his way in [[G2064]] from [[G575]] the country, [[G68]] [and] put [[G2007]] the [[G3588]] cross [[G4716]] on him [[G846]] to carry [[G5342]] behind [[G3693]] Jesus. [[G2424]]

### 27
A great [[G4183]] number [[G4128]] of people [[G2992]] followed [[G190]] Him, [[G846]] including [[G2532]] women [[G1135]] who [[G3739]] kept mourning [[G2875]] and [[G2532]] wailing [[G2354]] for Him. [[G846]]

### 28
But [[G1161]] Jesus [[G2424]] turned [[G4762]] to [[G4314]] them [[G846]] [and] said, [[G2036]] “Daughters [[G2364]] of Jerusalem, [[G2419]] {do} not [[G3361]] weep [[G2799]] for [[G1909]] Me, [[G1473]] but [[G4133]] weep [[G2799]] for [[G1909]] yourselves [[G1438]] and [[G2532]] for [[G1909]] your [[G4771]] children. [[G5043]]

### 29
Look, [[G2400]] [the] days [[G2250]] are coming [[G2064]] when [[G3739]] [people] will say, [[G2046]] ‘Blessed [are] [[G3107]] the [[G3588]] barren [women], [[G4723]] the [[G3588]] wombs [[G2836]] that [[G3739]] never [[G3756]] bore, [[G1080]] and [[G2532]] breasts [[G3149]] that [[G3739]] never [[G3756]] nursed.’ [[G5142]]

### 30
At that time [[G5119]] ‘they will say [[G3004]] to the [[G3588]] mountains, [[G3735]] “Fall [[G4098]] on [[G1909]] us!” [[G1473]] and [[G2532]] to the [[G3588]] hills, [[G1015]] “Cover [[G2572]] us!”’ [[G1473]]

### 31
For [[G3754]] if [[G1487]] [men] do [[G4160]] these things [[G3778]] [while] [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] tree [[G3586]] [is] green, [[G5200]] what [[G5101]] will happen [[G1096]] [when] [[G1722]] [it is] [[G3588]] dry?” [[G3584]]

### 32
Two [[G1417]] others, [[G2087]] [who were] criminals, [[G2557]] were also led away [[G71]] to be executed [[G337]] with [[G4862]] [Jesus]. [[G846]]

### 33
When [[G3753]] they came [[G2064]] to [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] place [[G5117]] called [[G2564]] The Skull, [[G2898]] they crucified [[G4717]] Him [[G846]] there, [[G1563]] along with [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] criminals, [[G2557]] one [[G3739]] on [[G1537]] [His] right [[G1188]] and [[G1161]] [the other] [[G3739]] on [[G1537]] [His] left. [[G710]]

### 34
Then [[G1161]] Jesus [[G2424]] said, [[G2036]] “Father, [[G3962]] forgive [[G863]] them, [[G846]] for [[G1063]] they do not know [[G1492]] what [[G5101]] they are doing.” [[G4160]] And [[G1161]] they divided up [[G1266]] His [[G846]] garments [[G2440]] by casting [[G906]] lots. [[G2819]]

### 35
The [[G3588]] people [[G2992]] stood [[G2476]] watching, [[G2334]] and [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] rulers [[G758]] sneered at [Him], [[G1592]] saying, [[G3004]] “He saved [[G4982]] others; [[G243]] let Him save [[G4982]] Himself [[G1438]] if [[G1487]] [He] [[G3778]] is [[G1510]] the [[G3588]] Christ [[G5547]] of God, [[G2316]] the [[G3588]] Chosen [One]. [[G1588]]

### 36
The [[G3588]] soldiers [[G4757]] also [[G2532]] mocked [[G1702]] Him [[G846]] [and] came up [[G4334]] to offer [[G4374]] Him [[G846]] sour wine. [[G3690]]

### 37
“If [[G1487]] You [[G4771]] are [[G1510]] the [[G3588]] King [[G935]] of the [[G3588]] Jews,” [[G2453]] they said, [[G3004]] “save [[G4982]] Yourself!” [[G4572]]

### 38
Above [[G1909]] Him [[G846]] was [posted] [[G1510]] an inscription: [[G1923]] [This is] the [[G3588]] King [[G935]] of the [[G3588]] Jews. [[G2453]]

### 39
One [[G1520]] of the [[G3588]] criminals [[G2557]] who hung [there] [[G2910]] heaped abuse on [[G987]] Him. [[G846]] “Are You [[G4771]] not [[G3780]] the [[G3588]] Christ?” [[G5547]] he said. [[G3004]] “Save [[G4982]] Yourself [[G4572]] and [[G2532]] us!” [[G1473]]

### 40
But [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] other [one] [[G2087]] rebuked [[G2008]] him, [[G846]] saying, [[G5346]] “{Do} you [[G4771]] not even [[G3761]] fear [[G5399]] God, [[G2316]] since [[G3754]] you are [[G1510]] under [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] same [[G846]] judgment? [[G2917]]

### 41
We [[G1473]] [ are punished ] [[G3303]] justly, [[G1346]] for [[G1063]] we are receiving [[G618]] what [[G3739]] we deserve [[G514]] for our actions. [[G4238]] But [[G1161]] [this] man [[G3778]] has done [[G4238]] nothing [[G3762]] wrong.” [[G824]]

### 42
Then [[G2532]] he said, [[G2036]] “Jesus, [[G2424]] remember [[G3403]] me [[G1473]] when [[G3752]] You come [[G2064]] into [[G1519]] Your [[G4771]] kingdom!” [[G932]]

### 43
And [[G2532]] [Jesus] said [[G2036]] to him, [[G846]] “Truly [[G281]] I tell [[G3004]] you, [[G4771]] today [[G4594]] you will be [[G1510]] with [[G3326]] Me [[G1473]] in [[G1722]] Paradise.” [[G3857]]

### 44
It was now [[G1510]] about [[G5616]] [the] sixth [[G1623]] hour, [[G5610]] and [[G2532]] darkness [[G4655]] came [[G1096]] over [[G1909]] all [[G3650]] the [[G3588]] land [[G1093]] until [[G2193]] [the] ninth [[G1766]] hour. [[G5610]]

### 45
The [[G3588]] sun [[G2246]] was darkened, [[G1587]] and [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] veil [[G2665]] of the [[G3588]] temple [[G3485]] was torn [[G4977]] down [the] middle. [[G3319]]

### 46
Then [[G2532]] Jesus [[G2424]] called out [[G5455]] in a loud voice, [[G5456]] “Father, [[G3962]] into [[G1519]] Your [[G4771]] hands [[G5495]] I commit [[G3908]] My [[G1473]] Spirit.” [[G4151]] And when [[G1161]] He had said [[G2036]] this, [[G3778]] He breathed His last. [[G1606]]

### 47
When [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] centurion [[G1543]] saw [[G3708]] what [[G3588]] had happened, [[G1096]] he gave glory [[G1392]] to God, [[G2316]] saying, [[G3004]] “Surely [[G3689]] this [[G3778]] was [[G1510]] [a] righteous [[G1342]] man.” [[G444]]

### 48
And [when] [[G2532]] all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] people [[G3793]] who had gathered [[G4836]] for [[G1909]] this [[G3778]] spectacle [[G2335]] saw [[G2334]] what [[G3588]] had taken place, [[G1096]] they returned [home] [[G5290]] beating [[G5180]] [their] [[G3588]] breasts. [[G4738]]

### 49
But [[G1161]] all [[G3956]] those who [[G3588]] knew [[G1110]] [Jesus], [[G846]] including [[G2532]] [the] women [[G1135]] who [[G3588]] had followed [[G4870]] Him [[G846]] from [[G575]] Galilee, [[G1056]] stood [[G2476]] at a distance [[G3113]] watching [[G3708]] these things. [[G3778]]

### 50
Now [[G2532]] [there was] [[G2400]] a Council member [[G1010]] named [[G3686]] Joseph, [[G2501]] a good [[G18]] and [[G2532]] righteous [[G1342]] man, [[G435]]

### 51
[who] [[G3778]] had not consented [[G4784]] to [[G3588]] their [[G846]] decision [[G1012]] [or] [[G2532]] action. [[G4234]] [He was] from [[G575]] [the] Judean town [[G4172]] [of] Arimathea, [[G707]] [and] [[G3739]] was waiting for [[G4327]] the [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] of God. [[G2316]]

### 52
He [[G3778]] went [[G4334]] to Pilate [[G4091]] to ask [for] [[G154]] the [[G3588]] body [[G4983]] of Jesus. [[G2424]]

### 53
Then [[G2532]] he took it down, [[G2507]] wrapped [[G1794]] it [[G846]] in a linen cloth, [[G4616]] and [[G2532]] placed [[G5087]] it [[G846]] in [[G1722]] a tomb [[G3418]] cut into the rock, [[G2991]] where [[G3739]] no one [[G3762]] had yet [[G1510]] been laid. [[G2749]]

### 54
It was [[G1510]] [the] Preparation [[G3904]] Day, [[G2250]] and [[G2532]] [the] Sabbath [[G4521]] was just beginning. [[G2020]]

### 55
The [[G3588]] women [[G1135]] who [[G3748]] had come with [[G4905]] [Jesus] [[G846]] from [[G1537]] Galilee [[G1056]] followed, [[G2628]] [and] they saw [[G2300]] the [[G3588]] tomb [[G3419]] and [[G2532]] how [[G5613]] His [[G846]] body [[G4983]] was placed. [[G5087]]

### 56
Then [[G1161]] they returned [[G5290]] to prepare [[G2090]] spices [[G759]] and [[G2532]] perfumes. [[G3464]] And [[G2532]] they rested [[G2270]] on the [[G3588]] Sabbath [[G4521]] according to [[G2596]] the [[G3588]] commandment. [[G1785]]
