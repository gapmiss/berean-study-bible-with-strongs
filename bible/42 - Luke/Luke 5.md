###### 1
On one occasion, [[G1161]] while [[G1722]] [Jesus] [[G846]] was [[G1510]] standing [[G2476]] by [[G3844]] the [[G3588]] Lake [[G3041]] of Gennesaret [[G1082]] [with] the [[G3588]] crowd [[G3793]] pressing in on [[G1945]] Him [[G846]] to hear [[G191]] the [[G3588]] word [[G3056]] of [[G3588]] God, [[G2316]]

###### 2
He saw [[G3708]] two [[G1417]] boats [[G4143]] at the edge [[G3844]] of the [[G3588]] lake. [[G3041]] The [[G3588]] fishermen [[G231]] had left [[G576]] them [[G846]] and were washing [[G4150]] [their] [[G3588]] nets. [[G1350]]

###### 3
[Jesus] got [[G1684]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] boat [[G4143]] belonging [[G1510]] to Simon [[G4613]] [and] asked [[G2065]] him [[G846]] to put out [[G1877]] a little [[G3641]] from [[G575]] shore. [[G1093]] And [[G1161]] sitting down, [[G2523]] He taught [[G1321]] the [[G3588]] people [[G3793]] from [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] boat. [[G4143]]

###### 4
When [[G5613]] [Jesus] had finished [[G3973]] speaking, [[G2980]] He said [[G2036]] to [[G4314]] Simon, [[G4613]] “Put out [[G1877]] into [[G1519]] deep [water] [[G899]] and [[G2532]] let down [[G5465]] your [[G4771]] nets [[G1350]] for [[G1519]] a catch.” [[G61]]

###### 5
“Master,” [[G1988]] Simon [[G4613]] replied, [[G611]] “we have worked [[G2872]] through [[G1223]] [the] night [[G3571]] [without] catching [[G2983]] [anything]. [[G3762]] But [[G1161]] because [[G1909]] You [[G4771]] say so, [[G4487]] I will let down [[G5465]] the [[G3588]] nets.” [[G1350]]

###### 6
When [[G2532]] they had done [[G4160]] so, [[G3778]] they caught [[G4788]] [such] a large [[G4183]] number [[G4128]] of fish [[G2486]] [that] [[G1161]] their [[G846]] nets [[G1350]] began to tear. [[G1284]]

###### 7
So [[G2532]] they signaled [[G2656]] to [their] [[G3588]] partners [[G3353]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] other [[G2087]] boat [[G4143]] to come [[G2064]] [and] help [[G4815]] them, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] they came [[G2064]] and [[G2532]] filled [[G4130]] both [[G297]] boats [[G4143]] so [full] that [[G5620]] they [[G846]] began to sink. [[G1036]]

###### 8
When [[G1161]] Simon [[G4613]] Peter [[G4074]] saw [this], [[G3708]] he fell at [[G4363]] Jesus’ [[G2424]] knees. [[G1119]] “Go away [[G1831]] from [[G575]] me, [[G1473]] Lord,” [[G2962]] he said, [[G3004]] “for [[G3754]] I am [[G1510]] a sinful [[G268]] man.” [[G435]]

###### 9
For [[G1063]] he [[G846]] and [[G2532]] his companions [[G3588]] were astonished [[G2285]] at [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] catch [[G61]] of [[G3588]] fish [[G2486]] they had taken, [[G4815]]

###### 10
and [[G1161]] so [were] [[G3668]] [his] [[G4613]] partners [[G2844]] James [[G2385]] and [[G2532]] John, [[G2491]] [the] sons [[G5207]] of Zebedee. [[G2199]] “{Do} not [[G3361]] be afraid,” [[G5399]] Jesus [[G2424]] said [[G2036]] to [[G4314]] Simon, [[G4613]] “from [[G575]] now on [[G3568]] you will [[G1510]] catch [[G2221]] men.” [[G444]]

###### 11
And when [[G2532]] they had brought [[G2609]] [their] [[G3588]] boats [[G4143]] ashore, [[G1093]] they left [[G863]] everything [[G3956]] [and] followed [[G190]] Him. [[G846]]

###### 12
While [[G2532]] [Jesus] [[G846]] was [[G1510]] in [[G1722]] one [[G1520]] of the [[G3588]] towns, [[G4172]] a man [[G435]] [came along] [[G2400]] [who was] covered [[G4134]] with leprosy. [[G3014]] When he saw [[G3708]] Jesus, [[G2424]] he fell [[G4098]] facedown [[G4383]] [and] begged [[G1189]] Him, [[G846]] “Lord, [[G2962]] if [[G1437]] You are willing, [[G2309]] You can [[G1410]] make me clean. [[G2511]]

###### 13
[Jesus] reached out [[G1614]] [His] [[G3588]] hand [[G5495]] [and] touched [[G680]] [the man]. [[G846]] “I am willing,” [[G2309]] He said, [[G3004]] “be clean!” [[G2511]] And [[G2532]] immediately [[G2112]] the [[G3588]] leprosy [[G3014]] left [[G565]] him. [[G846]]

###### 14
“{Do not} tell [[G2036]] [anyone],” [[G3367]] [Jesus] [[G846]] instructed [[G3853]] him. [[G846]] “But [[G235]] go, [[G565]] show [[G1166]] yourself [[G4572]] to the [[G3588]] priest [[G2409]] and [[G2532]] present the offering [[G4374]] Moses [[G3475]] prescribed [[G4367]] for [[G4012]] your [[G4771]] cleansing, [[G2512]] as [[G1519]] a testimony [[G3142]] to them.” [[G846]]

###### 15
But [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] news [[G3056]] about [[G4012]] [Jesus] [[G846]] spread [[G1330]] all the more, [[G3123]] and [[G2532]] great [[G4183]] crowds [[G3793]] came [[G4905]] to hear [Him] [[G191]] and [[G2532]] to be healed [[G2323]] of [[G575]] their [[G846]] sicknesses. [[G769]]

###### 16
Yet [[G1161]] He [[G846]] frequently [[G1510]] withdrew [[G5298]] to [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] wilderness [[G2048]] to [[G2532]] pray. [[G4336]]

###### 17
One [[G1520]] day [[G2250]] [Jesus] [[G846]] was [[G1510]] teaching, [[G1321]] and [[G2532]] [the] Pharisees [[G5330]] and [[G2532]] teachers of the law [[G3547]] were [[G1510]] sitting [there]. [[G2521]] [People] [[G3739]] had [[G1510]] come [[G2064]] from Jerusalem [[G2419]] and [[G2532]] from [[G1537]] every [[G3956]] village [[G2968]] of Galilee [[G1056]] and [[G2532]] Judea, [[G2449]] and [[G2532]] [the] power [[G1411]] of [the] Lord [[G2962]] was [present] [[G1510]] for [[G1519]] Him [[G846]] to heal [the sick]. [[G2390]]

###### 18
Just then, [[G2532]] [some] men [[G435]] [came] carrying [[G5342]] a paralyzed [[G3886]] man [[G444]] on [[G1909]] a mat. [[G2825]] They tried [[G2212]] to bring him inside [[G1533]] to set [[G5087]] him [[G846]] before [[G1799]] [Jesus], [[G846]]

###### 19
but [[G2532]] they could not find [[G2147]] a way [[G4169]] through [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] crowd. [[G3793]] So they went up [[G305]] on [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] roof [[G1430]] and lowered [[G2524]] him [[G846]] on [[G4862]] [his] [[G3588]] mat [[G2826]] through [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] tiles [[G2766]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] middle [of the crowd], [[G3319]] right in front of [[G1715]] Jesus. [[G2424]]

###### 20
When [[G2532]] [Jesus] saw [[G3708]] their [[G846]] faith, [[G4102]] He said, [[G2036]] “Friend, [[G444]] your [[G4771]] sins [[G266]] are forgiven.” [[G863]]

###### 21
But [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] scribes [[G1122]] and [[G2532]] Pharisees [[G5330]] began [[G756]] to consider [this] [[G1260]] [and] ask, [[G3004]] “Who [[G5101]] is [[G1510]] this [[G3778]] [man] who [[G3739]] speaks [[G2980]] blasphemy? [[G988]] Who [[G5101]] can [[G1410]] forgive [[G863]] sins [[G266]] but [[G1487]] God [[G2316]] alone? [[G3441]]

###### 22
Knowing [[G1921]] what they [[G846]] were thinking, [[G1261]] Jesus [[G2424]] replied, [[G611]] “Why [[G5101]] do you question this [[G1260]] in [[G1722]] your [[G4771]] hearts? [[G2588]]

###### 23
Which [[G5101]] is [[G1510]] easier: [[G2123]] to say, [[G2036]] ‘Your [[G4771]] sins [[G266]] are forgiven,’ [[G863]] or [[G2228]] to say, [[G2036]] ‘Get up [[G1453]] and [[G2532]] walk?’ [[G4043]]

###### 24
But [[G1161]] so that [[G2443]] you may know [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of Man [[G444]] has [[G2192]] authority [[G1849]] on [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] earth [[G1093]] to forgive [[G863]] sins...” [[G266]] He said [[G2036]] to the [[G3588]] paralytic, [[G3886]] “I tell [[G3004]] you, [[G4771]] get up, [[G1453]] pick up [[G142]] your [[G4771]] mat, [[G2826]] [and] go [[G4198]] home.” [[G3624]]

###### 25
Immediately [[G3916]] [the man] stood up [[G450]] before [[G1799]] them, [[G846]] took [[G142]] what [[G3739]] he had been lying [[G2621]] on, [[G1909]] and went [[G565]] home [[G3624]] glorifying [[G1392]] God. [[G2316]]

###### 26
Everyone [[G537]] was taken with [[G2983]] amazement [[G1611]] and [[G2532]] glorified [[G1392]] God. [[G2316]] They were filled [[G4130]] with awe [[G5401]] [and] said, [[G3004]] “We have seen [[G3708]] remarkable things [[G3861]] today.” [[G4594]]

###### 27
After [[G3326]] [this], [[G3778]] [Jesus] went out [[G1831]] and [[G2532]] saw [[G2300]] a tax collector [[G5057]] named [[G3686]] Levi [[G3018]] sitting [[G2521]] at [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] tax booth. [[G5058]] “Follow [[G190]] Me,” [[G1473]] He told [[G2036]] him, [[G846]]

###### 28
and [[G2532]] [Levi] got up, [[G450]] left [[G2641]] everything, [[G3956]] [and] followed [[G190]] Him. [[G846]]

###### 29
Then [[G2532]] Levi [[G3018]] hosted [[G4160]] a great [[G3173]] banquet [[G1403]] for [Jesus] [[G846]] at [[G1722]] his [[G846]] house. [[G3614]] A large [[G4183]] crowd [[G3793]] of tax collectors [[G5057]] was there, [[G1510]] along with [[G2532]] others [[G243]] who [[G3739]] were [[G1510]] eating [[G2621]] with [[G3326]] them. [[G846]]

###### 30
But [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] Pharisees [[G5330]] and [[G2532]] their [[G846]] scribes [[G1122]] complained [[G1111]] to [[G4314]] [Jesus’] [[G846]] disciples, [[G3101]] “Why [[G1223]] do you eat [[G2068]] and [[G2532]] drink [[G4095]] with [[G3326]] tax collectors [[G5057]] and [[G2532]] sinners?” [[G268]]

###### 31
Jesus [[G2424]] answered, [[G611]] “[It is] not [[G3756]] the [[G3588]] healthy [[G5198]] [who] [[G2192]] need [[G5532]] a doctor, [[G2395]] but [[G235]] the [[G3588]] sick. [[G2560]]

###### 32
I have not come [[G2064]] to call [[G2564]] [the] righteous, [[G1342]] but [[G235]] sinners, [[G268]] to [[G1519]] repentance.” [[G3341]]

###### 33
Then [[G1161]] they said [[G2036]] to [[G4314]] Him, [[G846]] “John’s [[G2491]] disciples [[G3101]] and [[G2532]] those [[G3588]] of the [[G3588]] Pharisees [[G5330]] frequently [[G4437]] fast [[G3522]] and [[G2532]] pray, [[G1162]] but [[G1161]] Yours [[G4674]] keep on eating [[G2068]] and [[G2532]] drinking.” [[G4095]]

###### 34
Jesus [[G2424]] replied, [[G2036]] “Can you [[G1410]] make [[G4160]] the [[G3588]] guests [[G5207]] of the [[G3588]] bridegroom [[G3567]] fast [[G3522]] while [[G3739]] [He] [[G3566]] is [[G1510]] with [[G3326]] them? [[G846]]

###### 35
But [[G1161]] [the] time [[G2250]] will come [[G2064]] when [[G3752]] the [[G3588]] bridegroom [[G3566]] will be taken away [[G522]] from [[G575]] them; [[G846]] then [[G5119]] they will fast.” [[G3522]]

###### 36
He also told [[G2036]] them [[G846]] a parable: [[G3850]] “No one [[G3762]] tears [[G4977]] a piece of cloth [[G1915]] from [[G575]] a new [[G2537]] garment [[G2440]] [and] sews [it] [[G1911]] on [[G1909]] an old [[G3820]] [one]. [[G2440]] If he does, [[G1487]] he will tear [[G4977]] the [[G3588]] new [garment] [[G2537]] as well, [[G2532]] and [[G2532]] [the] patch [[G1915]] from [[G575]] the [[G3588]] new [[G2537]] will not match [[G4856]] the [[G3588]] old. [[G3820]]

###### 37
And [[G2532]] no one [[G3762]] pours [[G906]] new [[G3501]] wine [[G3631]] into [[G1519]] old [[G3820]] wineskins. [[G779]] If he does, [[G1490]] the [[G3588]] new [[G3501]] wine [[G3631]] will burst [[G4486]] the [[G3588]] skins, [[G779]] [the wine] [[G846]] will spill, [[G1632]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] wineskins [[G779]] will be ruined. [[G622]]

###### 38
Instead, [[G235]] new [[G3501]] wine [[G3631]] is poured [[G992]] into [[G1519]] new [[G2537]] wineskins. [[G779]]

###### 39
And [[G2532]] no one [[G3762]] after drinking [[G4095]] old [wine ] [[G3820]] wants [[G2309]] new, [[G3501]] for [[G1063]] he says, [[G3004]] ‘The [[G3588]] old [[G3820]] is [[G1510]] better.’” [[G5543]]
