###### 1
In [[G1722]] the meantime, [[G3739]] a crowd [[G3793]] of [[G3588]] many thousands [[G3461]] had gathered, [[G1996]] so that [[G5620]] they were trampling [[G2662]] one another. [[G240]] [Jesus] began [[G756]] to speak [[G3004]] first [[G4412]] to [[G4314]] His [[G846]] disciples: [[G3101]] “Beware [[G4337]] of [[G575]] the [[G3588]] yeast [[G2219]] of the [[G3588]] Pharisees, [[G5330]] which [[G3748]] is [[G1510]] hypocrisy. [[G5272]]

###### 2
[There] [[G1161]] is [[G1510]] nothing [[G3762]] concealed [[G4780]] that [[G3739]] will not be disclosed, [[G601]] [or] [[G2532]] hidden [[G2927]] that [[G3739]] will not [[G3756]] be made known. [[G1097]]

###### 3
What [[G3745]] you have spoken [[G2036]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] dark [[G4653]] will be heard [[G191]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] daylight, [[G5457]] and [[G2532]] what [[G3739]] you have whispered [[G2980]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] inner rooms [[G5009]] will be proclaimed [[G2784]] from [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] housetops. [[G1430]]

###### 4
I tell [[G3004]] you, [[G4771]] My [[G1473]] friends, [[G5384]] do not be afraid [[G5399]] of [[G575]] those who [[G3588]] kill [[G615]] the [[G3588]] body [[G4983]] and [[G2532]] after [[G3326]] that [[G3778]] can [[G2192]] do [[G4160]] no [[G5100]] more. [[G4053]]

###### 5
But [[G1161]] I will show [[G5263]] you [[G4771]] whom [[G5101]] you should fear: [[G5399]] Fear [[G5399]] the [One who], [[G3588]] after [[G3326]] [you] [[G3588]] have been killed, [[G615]] has [[G2192]] power [[G1849]] to throw [you] [[G1685]] into [[G1519]] hell. [[G1067]] Yes, [[G3483]] I tell [[G3004]] you, [[G4771]] fear [[G5399]] Him! [[G3778]]

###### 6
{Are} not [[G3780]] five [[G4002]] sparrows [[G4765]] sold [[G4453]] for two [[G1417]] pennies? [[G787]] Yet [[G2532]] not [[G3756]] one [[G1520]] of [[G1537]] them [[G846]] is [[G1510]] forgotten [[G1950]] by [[G1799]] God. [[G2316]]

###### 7
[And even] [[G235]] the [[G3588]] very [[G2532]] hairs [[G2359]] of [[G3588]] your [[G4771]] head [[G2776]] are all numbered. [[G705]] [So] do not be afraid; [[G5399]] you are worth more [[G1308]] than many [[G4183]] sparrows. [[G4765]]

###### 8
I tell [[G3004]] you, [[G4771]] everyone [[G3956]] who [[G3739]] confesses [[G3670]] Me [[G1473]] before [[G1715]] men, [[G444]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of Man [[G444]] will also confess [[G3670]] him [[G846]] before [[G1715]] the [[G3588]] angels [[G32]] of God. [[G2316]]

###### 9
But [[G1161]] whoever [[G3588]] denies [[G720]] Me [[G1473]] before [[G1799]] men [[G444]] will be denied [[G533]] before [[G1799]] the [[G3588]] angels [[G32]] of God. [[G2316]]

###### 10
And [[G2532]] everyone [[G3956]] who [[G3739]] speaks [[G2046]] a word [[G3056]] against [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of Man [[G444]] will be forgiven, [[G863]] but [[G1161]] whoever [[G3588]] blasphemes [[G987]] against [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] Holy [[G40]] Spirit [[G4151]] will not be forgiven. [[G863]]

###### 11
When [[G3752]] you [[G4771]] are brought [[G1533]] before [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] synagogues, [[G4864]] rulers, [[G746]] and [[G2532]] authorities, [[G1849]] {do} not [[G3361]] worry about [[G3309]] how [[G4459]] to defend yourselves [[G626]] or [[G2228]] what [[G5101]] to say. [[G2036]]

###### 12
For [[G1063]] at [[G1722]] that [[G846]] time [[G5610]] the [[G3588]] Holy [[G40]] Spirit [[G4151]] will teach [[G1321]] you [[G4771]] what [[G3739]] you should [[G1163]] say.” [[G2036]]

###### 13
Someone [[G5100]] in [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] crowd [[G3793]] said [[G2036]] to Him, [[G846]] “Teacher, [[G1320]] tell [[G2036]] my [[G1473]] brother [[G80]] to divide [[G3307]] the [[G3588]] inheritance [[G2817]] with [[G3326]] me.” [[G1473]]

###### 14
But [[G1161]] [Jesus] replied, [[G2036]] “Man, [[G444]] who [[G5101]] appointed [[G2525]] Me [[G1473]] judge [[G2923]] or [[G2228]] executor [[G3312]] between [[G1909]] you?” [[G4771]]

###### 15
And [[G1161]] He said [[G2036]] to [[G4314]] them, [[G846]] “Watch out! [[G3708]] Guard yourselves [[G5442]] against [[G575]] every [form of] [[G3956]] greed, [[G4124]] for [[G3754]] a man’s [[G5100]] life [[G2222]] does not consist [[G1510]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] abundance [[G4052]] of [[G1537]] his [[G846]] possessions.” [[G5225]]

###### 16
Then [[G1161]] He told [[G2036]] them [[G846]] a parable: [[G3850]] “The [[G3588]] ground [[G5561]] of a certain [[G5100]] rich [[G4145]] man [[G444]] produced an abundance. [[G2164]]

###### 17
So [[G2532]] he thought [[G1260]] to [[G1722]] himself, [[G1438]] ‘What [[G5101]] shall I do, [[G4160]] since [[G3754]] I have [[G2192]] nowhere [[G3756]] to store [[G4863]] my [[G1473]] crops?’ [[G2590]]

###### 18
Then [[G2532]] he said, [[G2036]] ‘This [is what] [[G3778]] I will do: [[G4160]] I will tear down [[G2507]] my [[G1473]] barns [[G596]] and [[G2532]] will build [[G3618]] bigger [ones], [[G3173]] and [[G2532]] there [[G1563]] I will store up [[G4863]] all [[G3956]] my [[G1473]] grain [[G4621]] and [[G2532]] [my] [[G3588]] goods. [[G18]]

###### 19
Then [[G2532]] I will say [[G2046]] to [[G3588]] myself, [[G1473]] “You [[G5590]] have [[G2192]] plenty of [[G4183]] good things [[G18]] laid up [[G2749]] for [[G1519]] many [[G4183]] years. [[G2094]] Take it easy. [[G373]] Eat, [[G5315]] drink, [[G4095]] [and] be merry!”’ [[G2165]]

###### 20
But [[G1161]] God [[G2316]] said [[G2036]] to him, [[G846]] ‘[You] fool! [[G878]] This [[G3778]] very [[G3588]] night [[G3571]] your [[G4771]] life [[G5590]] will be required [[G523]] of [[G575]] you. [[G4771]] Then [[G1161]] who [[G5101]] will own [[G1510]] what [[G3739]] you have accumulated?’ [[G2090]]

###### 21
This is how [it will be for] [[G3779]] anyone who [[G3588]] stores up treasure [[G2343]] for himself [[G1438]] but [[G2532]] is not rich [[G4147]] toward [[G1519]] God.” [[G2316]]

###### 22
Then [[G1161]] [Jesus] said [[G2036]] to [[G4314]] His [[G846]] disciples, [[G3101]] “Therefore [[G1223]] I tell [[G3004]] you, [[G4771]] {do} not [[G3361]] worry [[G3309]] about [[G3588]] your life, [[G5590]] what [[G5101]] you will eat, [[G5315]] [or] [[G3366]] about [[G3588]] your [[G4771]] body, [[G4983]] what [[G5101]] you will wear. [[G1746]]

###### 23
For [[G1063]] life [[G5590]] is [[G1510]] more than [[G4119]] food, [[G5160]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] body [[G4983]] [more] than [[G3588]] clothes. [[G1742]]

###### 24
Consider [[G2657]] the [[G3588]] ravens: [[G2876]] They do not sow [[G4687]] [or] [[G3761]] reap; [[G2325]] they [[G3739]] have [[G1510]] no [[G3756]] storehouse [[G5009]] [or] [[G3761]] barn, [[G596]] yet [[G2532]] God [[G2316]] feeds [[G5142]] them. [[G846]] How much [[G4214]] more [[G3123]] valuable are you [[G1308]] than the [[G3588]] birds! [[G4071]]

###### 25
Who [[G5101]] of [[G1537]] you [[G4771]] by worrying [[G3309]] can [[G1410]] add [[G4369]] a single hour [[G4083]] to [[G1909]] his [[G846]] lifespan? [[G2244]]

###### 26
So [[G3767]] if [[G1487]] you cannot [do] [[G1410]] such a small thing, [[G1646]] why [[G5101]] do you worry [[G3309]] about [[G4012]] the [[G3588]] rest? [[G3062]]

###### 27
Consider [[G2657]] how [[G4459]] the [[G3588]] lilies [[G2918]] grow: [[G837]] They do not labor [[G2872]] [or] [[G3761]] spin. [[G3514]] Yet [[G1161]] I tell [[G3004]] you, [[G4771]] not even [[G3761]] Solomon [[G4672]] in [[G1722]] all [[G3956]] his [[G846]] glory [[G1391]] was adorned [[G4016]] like [[G5613]] one [[G1520]] of these. [[G3778]]

###### 28
If [[G1487]] that is how [[G3779]] God [[G2316]] clothes [[G294]] the [[G3588]] grass [[G5528]] of [[G1722]] [the] field, [[G68]] which is [here] [[G1510]] today [[G4594]] and [[G2532]] tomorrow [[G839]] is thrown [[G906]] into [[G1519]] the furnace, [[G2823]] how much [[G4214]] [more will He clothe] [[G3123]] you, [[G4771]] O [you] of little faith! [[G3640]]

###### 29
And [[G2532]] {do} not [[G3361]] be concerned about [[G2212]] what [[G5101]] you will eat [[G5315]] [or] [[G2532]] drink. [[G4095]] {Do} not [[G3361]] worry about [it]. [[G3349]]

###### 30
For [[G1063]] the [[G3588]] nations [[G1484]] of the [[G3588]] world [[G2889]] strive after [[G1934]] all [[G3956]] these things, [[G3778]] and [[G1161]] your [[G4771]] Father [[G3962]] knows [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] you need [[G5535]] them. [[G3778]]

###### 31
But [[G4133]] seek [[G2212]] His [[G846]] kingdom, [[G932]] and [[G2532]] these things [[G3778]] will be added [[G4369]] unto you. [[G4771]]

###### 32
{Do} not [[G3361]] be afraid, [[G5399]] little [[G3398]] flock, [[G4168]] for [[G3754]] your [[G4771]] Father [[G3962]] is pleased [[G2106]] to give [[G1325]] you [[G4771]] the [[G3588]] kingdom. [[G932]]

###### 33
Sell [[G4453]] your [[G4771]] possessions [[G5225]] and [[G2532]] give [[G1325]] to the poor. [[G1654]] Provide [[G4160]] yourselves [[G1438]] [with] purses [[G905]] [that will] not [[G3361]] wear out, [[G3822]] an inexhaustible [[G413]] treasure [[G2344]] in [[G1722]] heaven, [[G3772]] where [[G3699]] no [[G3756]] thief [[G2812]] approaches [[G1448]] [and] no [[G3761]] moth [[G4597]] destroys. [[G1311]]

###### 34
For [[G1063]] where [[G3699]] your [[G4771]] treasure [[G2344]] is, [[G1510]] there [[G1563]] your [[G4771]] heart [[G2588]] will be [[G1510]] also. [[G2532]]

###### 35
Be [[G1510]] dressed for service [[G4771]] and {keep} [[G2532]] [your] [[G3588]] lamps [[G3088]] burning. [[G2545]]

###### 36
Then [[G2532]] you [[G4771]] [ will be ] like [[G3664]] [servants] [[G444]] waiting for [[G4327]] their [[G1438]] master [[G2962]] to return [[G360]] from [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] wedding banquet, [[G1062]] so that [[G2443]] when he comes [[G2064]] and [[G2532]] knocks, [[G2925]] they can open [the door] [[G455]] for him [[G846]] at once. [[G2112]]

###### 37
Blessed [are] [[G3107]] those [[G1565]] servants [[G1401]] whom [[G3739]] the [[G3588]] master [[G2962]] finds [[G2147]] on watch [[G1127]] when he returns. [[G2064]] Truly [[G281]] I tell [[G3004]] you, [[G4771]] he will dress himself to serve [[G4024]] and [[G2532]] will have them recline at the table, [[G347]] and [[G2532]] he [himself] will come [[G3928]] [and] wait on [[G1247]] them. [[G846]]

###### 38
Even if [[G2579]] he comes [[G2064]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] second [[G1208]] or [[G2579]] third [[G5154]] watch of the night [[G5438]] and [[G2532]] finds [them] [[G2147]] alert, [[G3779]] those [servants] [[G1565]] will be [[G1510]] blessed! [[G3107]]

###### 39
But [[G1161]] understand [[G1097]] this: [[G3778]] If [[G1487]] the [[G3588]] homeowner [[G3617]] had known [[G1492]] at what [[G4169]] hour [[G5610]] the [[G3588]] thief [[G2812]] was coming, [[G2064]] he would not have let [[G863]] his [[G846]] house [[G3624]] be broken into. [[G1358]]

###### 40
You [[G4771]] also [[G2532]] must be [[G1096]] ready, [[G2092]] because [[G3754]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of Man [[G444]] will come [[G2064]] at an [[G3739]] hour [[G5610]] you do not expect.” [[G1380]]

###### 41
“Lord,” [[G2962]] said [[G2036]] Peter, [[G4074]] “are You addressing [[G3004]] this [[G3778]] parable [[G3850]] to [[G4314]] us, [[G1473]] or [[G2228]] to [[G4314]] everyone else [[G3956]] as well?” [[G2532]]

###### 42
And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] answered, [[G2036]] “Who [[G5101]] then [[G686]] is [[G1510]] the [[G3588]] faithful [[G4103]] [and] [[G3588]] wise [[G5429]] manager, [[G3623]] whom [[G3739]] the [[G3588]] master [[G2962]] puts [[G2525]] in charge [[G2322]] of [[G1909]] his [[G846]] [servants] [[G3588]] to give [them] [[G1325]] [their] [[G3588]] portion [[G4620]] at [[G1722]] the proper time? [[G2540]]

###### 43
Blessed [is] [[G3107]] that [[G1565]] servant [[G1401]] whom [[G3739]] his [[G846]] master [[G2962]] finds [[G2147]] doing [[G4160]] so [[G3779]] when he returns. [[G2064]]

###### 44
Truly [[G230]] I tell [[G3004]] you, [[G4771]] he will put him in charge [[G2525]] of [[G1909]] all [[G3956]] his [[G846]] possessions. [[G5225]]

###### 45
But [[G1161]] suppose [[G1437]] that [[G1565]] servant [[G1401]] says [[G2036]] in [[G1722]] his [[G846]] heart, [[G2588]] ‘My [[G1473]] master [[G2962]] will be a long time [[G5549]] in coming,’ [[G2064]] and [[G2532]] he begins [[G756]] to beat [[G5180]] the [[G3588]] male [[G3816]] and [[G2532]] female servants, [[G3814]] and [[G5037]] to eat [[G2068]] and [[G2532]] drink [[G4095]] and [[G2532]] get drunk. [[G3182]]

###### 46
The [[G3588]] master [[G2962]] of that [[G1565]] servant [[G1401]] will come [[G2240]] on [[G1722]] a day [[G2250]] when [[G3739]] he does not expect [him], [[G4328]] and [[G2532]] at [[G1722]] an hour [[G5610]] of which [[G3739]] he is unaware. [[G1097]] Then [[G2532]] He will cut him to pieces [[G1371]] and [[G2532]] assign [[G5087]] him [[G846]] a [[G3588]] place [[G3313]] with [[G3326]] the [[G3588]] unbelievers. [[G571]]

###### 47
That [[G1565]] servant [[G1401]] who [[G3588]] knows [[G1097]] his [[G846]] master’s [[G2962]] will [[G2307]] [but] [[G2532]] does not get ready [[G2090]] [or] [[G2228]] follow [[G4160]] his [[G846]] instructions [[G2307]] will be beaten with [[G1194]] many [blows]. [[G4183]]

###### 48
But [[G1161]] the [one who] [[G3588]] unknowingly [[G1097]] does [[G4160]] [things] worthy [[G514]] of punishment [[G4127]] will be beaten with [[G1194]] few [blows]. [[G3641]] [From] [[G1161]] everyone [[G3956]] who [[G3739]] has been given [[G1325]] much, [[G4183]] much [[G4183]] will be required; [[G2212]] and [[G2532]] from [[G3844]] him [[G846]] who [[G3739]] has been entrusted [[G3908]] with much, [[G4183]] even more [[G4053]] will be demanded. [[G154]]

###### 49
I have come [[G2064]] to ignite [[G906]] a fire [[G4442]] on [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] earth, [[G1093]] and [[G2532]] how [[G5101]] I wish [[G2309]] it were already kindled! [[G381]]

###### 50
But [[G1161]] I have [[G2192]] a baptism [[G908]] to undergo, [[G907]] and [[G2532]] how [[G4459]] distressed I am [[G4912]] until [[G2193]] it is accomplished! [[G5055]]

###### 51
Do you think [[G1380]] that [[G3754]] I have come [[G3854]] to bring [[G1325]] peace [[G1515]] to [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] earth? [[G1093]] No, [[G3780]] I tell [[G3004]] you, [[G4771]] but [[G235]] division. [[G1267]]

###### 52
From [[G575]] now on, [[G3568]] five [[G4002]] in [[G1722]] one [[G1520]] household [[G3624]] will be [[G1510]] divided, [[G1266]] three [[G5140]] against [[G1909]] two [[G1417]] and [[G2532]] two [[G1417]] against [[G1909]] three. [[G5140]]

###### 53
They will be divided, [[G1266]] father [[G3962]] against [[G1909]] son [[G5207]] and [[G2532]] son [[G5207]] against [[G1909]] father, [[G3962]] mother [[G3384]] against [[G1909]] daughter [[G2364]] and [[G2532]] daughter [[G2364]] against [[G1909]] mother, [[G3384]] mother-in-law [[G3994]] against [[G1909]] daughter-in-law [[G3565]] and [[G2532]] daughter-in-law [[G3565]] against [[G1909]] mother-in-law.” [[G3994]]

###### 54
Then [[G1161]] [Jesus] said [[G2036]] to the [[G3588]] crowds, [[G3793]] “As soon as [[G3752]] you see [[G3708]] a [[G3588]] cloud [[G3507]] rising [[G393]] in [[G1909]] [the] west, [[G1424]] you say, [[G3004]] ‘A shower [[G3655]] is coming,’ [[G2064]] and [[G2532]] that is what [[G3779]] happens. [[G1096]]

###### 55
And [[G2532]] when [[G3752]] [the] south wind [[G3558]] blows, [[G4154]] you say, [[G3004]] ‘It will be [[G1510]] hot,’ [[G2742]] and [[G2532]] it is. [[G1096]]

###### 56
[You] hypocrites! [[G5273]] You know how [[G1492]] to interpret [[G1381]] the [[G3588]] appearance [[G4383]] of the [[G3588]] earth [[G1093]] and [[G2532]] sky. [[G3772]] Why [[G4459]] don’t you know how [[G1492]] to interpret [[G1381]] [the] [[G3778]] present time? [[G2540]]

###### 57
And [[G2532]] why [[G5101]] don’t [[G3756]] you judge [[G2919]] for [[G575]] yourselves [[G1438]] what [is] [[G3588]] right? [[G1342]]
