### 1
Now [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] Feast [[G1859]] of [[G3588]] Unleavened [Bread], [[G106]] called [[G3004]] [the] Passover, [[G3957]] was approaching, [[G1448]]

### 2
and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] chief priests [[G749]] and [[G2532]] scribes [[G1122]] were looking [[G2212]] for a way [[G4459]] to put [Jesus] to death; [[G337]] for [[G1063]] they feared [[G5399]] the [[G3588]] people. [[G2992]]

### 3
Then [[G1161]] Satan [[G4567]] entered [[G1525]] Judas [[G2455]] Iscariot, [[G2469]] who was [[G1510]] [one] [[G706]] of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] Twelve. [[G1427]]

### 4
And [[G2532]] [Judas] went [[G565]] to discuss with [[G4814]] the [[G3588]] chief priests [[G749]] and [[G2532]] [temple] officers [[G4755]] how [[G4459]] he might betray [[G3860]] [Jesus] [[G846]] to them. [[G846]]

### 5
They were delighted [[G5463]] and [[G2532]] agreed [[G4934]] to give [[G1325]] him [[G846]] money. [[G694]]

### 6
[Judas] consented, [[G1843]] and [[G2532]] began to look for [[G2212]] [an] opportunity [[G2120]] to betray [[G3860]] [Jesus] [[G846]] to them [[G846]] in the absence of [[G817]] [a] crowd. [[G3793]]

### 7
Then [[G1161]] came [[G2064]] the [[G3588]] day [[G2250]] of [[G3588]] Unleavened [Bread] [[G106]] on [[G1722]] which [[G3739]] the [[G3588]] Passover lamb [[G3957]] was to [[G1163]] be sacrificed. [[G2380]]

### 8
[Jesus] sent [[G649]] Peter [[G4074]] and [[G2532]] John, [[G2491]] saying, [[G2036]] “Go [[G4198]] [and] prepare [[G2090]] for us [[G1473]] to [[G2443]] eat [[G5315]] the [[G3588]] Passover.” [[G3957]]

### 9
“Where [[G4226]] do You want [[G2309]] us to prepare [it]?” [[G2090]] they asked. [[G2036]]

### 10
He answered, [[G2036]] “When you enter [[G1525]] the [[G3588]] city, [[G4172]] a man [[G444]] carrying [[G941]] a jug [[G2765]] of water [[G5204]] will meet [[G4876]] you. [[G4771]] Follow [[G190]] him [[G846]] to [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] house [[G3614]] he enters, [[G1531]]

### 11
and [[G2532]] say [[G2046]] to the [[G3588]] owner [[G3617]] of that [[G3588]] house, [[G3614]] ‘The [[G3588]] Teacher [[G1320]] asks, [[G3004]] “Where [[G4226]] is [[G1510]] the [[G3588]] guest room, [[G2646]] where [[G3699]] I may eat [[G5315]] the [[G3588]] Passover [[G3957]] with [[G3326]] My [[G1473]] disciples?”’ [[G3101]]

### 12
And he [[G2548]] will show [[G1166]] you [[G4771]] a large, [[G3173]] furnished [[G4766]] upper room. [[G508]] Make the preparations [[G2090]] there.” [[G1563]]

### 13
So [[G1161]] they went [[G565]] [and] found [it] [[G2147]] just as [[G2531]] [Jesus] had told [[G2046]] them. [[G846]] And [[G2532]] they prepared [[G2090]] the [[G3588]] Passover. [[G3957]]

### 14
When [[G3753]] the [[G3588]] hour [[G5610]] had come, [[G1096]] [Jesus] reclined at the table [[G377]] with [[G4862]] His [[G846]] apostles. [[G652]]

### 15
And [[G2532]] He said [[G2036]] to [[G4314]] them, [[G846]] “I have eagerly desired [[G1937]] to eat [[G5315]] this [[G3778]] Passover [[G3957]] with [[G3326]] you [[G4771]] before [[G4253]] My [[G1473]] suffering. [[G3958]]

### 16
For [[G1063]] I tell [[G3004]] you [[G4771]] that [[G3754]] I will not eat [[G5315]] it [[G846]] again until [[G2193]] it is fulfilled [[G4137]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] of God.” [[G2316]]

### 17
After [[G2532]] taking [[G1209]] [the] cup, [[G4221]] [He] gave thanks [[G2168]] [and] said, [[G2036]] “Take [[G2983]] this [[G3778]] and [[G2532]] divide [it] [[G1266]] among [[G1519]] yourselves. [[G1438]]

### 18
For [[G1063]] I tell [[G3004]] you [[G4771]] that [[G3754]] I will not drink [[G4095]] of [[G575]] the [[G3588]] fruit [[G1081]] of the [[G3588]] vine [[G288]] from [[G575]] now on [[G3568]] until [[G2193]] the [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] of God [[G2316]] comes.” [[G2064]]

### 19
And [[G2532]] He took [[G2983]] [the] bread, [[G740]] gave thanks [[G2168]] [and] broke [it], [[G2806]] and [[G2532]] gave [it] [[G1325]] to them, [[G846]] saying, [[G3004]] “This [[G3778]] is [[G1510]] My [[G1473]] body, [[G4983]] given [[G1325]] for [[G5228]] you; [[G4771]] do [[G4160]] this [[G3778]] in [[G1519]] remembrance [[G364]] of Me. [[G1699]]

### 20
In the same way, [[G5615]] after [[G3326]] supper [[G1172]] [He took] the [[G3588]] cup, [[G4221]] saying, [[G3004]] “This [[G3778]] cup [is] [[G4221]] the [[G3588]] new [[G2537]] covenant [[G1242]] in [[G1722]] My [[G1473]] blood, [[G129]] which [[G3588]] is poured out [[G1632]] for [[G5228]] you. [[G4771]]

### 21
Look! [[G2400]] The [[G3588]] hand [[G5495]] of My betrayer [[G3860]] [is] with [[G3326]] Mine [[G1473]] on [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] table. [[G5132]]

### 22
Indeed, [[G3303]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of [[G3588]] Man [[G444]] will go [[G4198]] as [[G2596]] it has been determined, [[G3724]] but [[G4133]] woe [[G3759]] to that [[G1565]] man [[G444]] who [[G3739]] betrays Him.” [[G3860]]

### 23
Then [[G2532]] they [[G846]] began [[G756]] to question [[G4802]] among [[G4314]] themselves [[G1438]] which [[G5101]] of [[G1537]] them [[G846]] was [[G1510]] going [[G3195]] to do [[G4238]] this. [[G3778]]

### 24
A dispute [[G5379]] also [[G2532]] arose [[G1096]] among [[G1722]] [the disciples] [[G846]] [as to] [[G3588]] which [[G5101]] of them [[G846]] would be considered [[G1380]] [the] greatest. [[G3173]]

### 25
So [[G1161]] [Jesus] declared, [[G2036]] “The [[G3588]] kings [[G935]] of the [[G3588]] Gentiles [[G1484]] lord it over [[G2961]] them, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] those [[G3588]] in authority over [[G1850]] them [[G846]] call themselves [[G2564]] benefactors. [[G2110]]

### 26
But [[G1161]] you [[G4771]] [shall] not [be] [[G3756]] like them. [[G3779]] Instead, [[G235]] the [[G3588]] greatest [[G3173]] among [[G1722]] you [[G4771]] should be [[G1096]] like [[G5613]] the [[G3588]] youngest, [[G3501]] and [[G2532]] the [one who] [[G3588]] leads [[G2233]] like [[G5613]] the [one who] [[G3588]] serves. [[G1247]]

### 27
For [[G1063]] who [[G5101]] [is] greater, [[G3173]] the [one who] [[G3588]] reclines at the table [[G345]] or [[G2228]] the [one who] [[G3588]] serves? [[G1247]] [Is it] not [[G3780]] the [one who] [[G3588]] reclines? [[G345]] But [[G1161]] I [[G1473]] am [[G1510]] among you [[G3319]] as [[G5613]] the [One who] [[G3588]] serves. [[G1247]]

### 28
You [[G4771]] are [[G1510]] the ones [[G3588]] who have stood [[G1265]] by [[G3326]] Me [[G1473]] in [[G1722]] My [[G1473]] trials. [[G3986]]

### 29
And I [[G2504]] bestow [[G1303]] on you [[G4771]] a kingdom, [[G932]] just as [[G2531]] My [[G1473]] Father [[G3962]] has bestowed [[G1303]] on Me, [[G1473]]

### 30
so that [[G2443]] you may eat [[G2068]] and [[G2532]] drink [[G4095]] at [[G1909]] My [[G1473]] table [[G5132]] in [[G1722]] My [[G1473]] kingdom, [[G932]] and [[G2532]] sit [[G2521]] on [[G1909]] thrones, [[G2362]] judging [[G2919]] the [[G3588]] twelve [[G1427]] tribes [[G5443]] of [[G3588]] Israel. [[G2474]]

### 31
Simon, [[G4613]] Simon, [[G4613]] Satan [[G4567]] has asked [[G1809]] to sift [[G4617]] each of you [[G4771]] like [[G5613]] wheat. [[G4621]]

### 32
But [[G1161]] I [[G1473]] have prayed [[G1189]] for [[G4012]] you, [ Simon ], [[G4771]] that [[G2443]] your [[G4771]] faith [[G4102]] will not fail. [[G1587]] And [[G2532]] when [[G4218]] you [[G4771]] have turned back, [[G1994]] strengthen [[G4741]] your [[G4771]] brothers.” [[G80]]

### 33
“Lord,” [[G2962]] said [Peter], [[G2036]] “I am [[G1510]] ready [[G2092]] to go [[G4198]] with [[G3326]] You [[G4771]] even [[G2532]] to [[G1519]] prison [[G5438]] and [[G2532]] to [[G1519]] death.” [[G2288]]

### 34
But [[G1161]] [Jesus] replied, [[G2036]] “I tell [[G3004]] you, [[G4771]] Peter, [[G4074]] [the] rooster [[G220]] {will} not [[G3756]] crow [[G5455]] today [[G4594]] until [[G2193]] you have denied [[G533]] three times [[G5151]] that you know [[G1492]] Me.” [[G1473]]

### 35
Then [[G2532]] [Jesus] asked [[G2036]] them, [[G846]] “When [[G3753]] I sent you out [[G649]] without [[G817]] purse [[G905]] [or] [[G2532]] bag [[G4082]] [or] [[G2532]] sandals, [[G5266]] did you lack [[G5302]] anything?” [[G5100]] “Nothing,” [[G3762]] they answered. [[G2036]]

### 36
“Now, [[G3568]] however,” [[G235]] He told [[G2036]] them, [[G846]] “the [one] [[G3588]] with [[G2192]] a purse [[G905]] should take [it], [[G142]] and [[G2532]] likewise [[G3668]] a bag; [[G4082]] and [[G2532]] the [one] [[G3588]] without [[G2192]] a sword [[G3162]] should sell [[G4453]] his [[G846]] cloak [[G2440]] and [[G2532]] buy [one]. [[G59]]

### 37
For [[G1063]] I tell [[G3004]] you [[G4771]] that [[G3754]] this [[G3778]] Scripture [[G1125]] must [[G1163]] be fulfilled [[G5055]] in [[G1722]] Me: [[G1473]] ‘And [[G2532]] He was numbered [[G3049]] with [[G3326]] [the] transgressors.’ [[G459]] For [[G1063]] [what is written] [[G3588]] about [[G4012]] Me [[G1473]] is reaching [[G2192]] its fulfillment.” [[G5056]]

### 38
So [[G1161]] they said, [[G2036]] “Look, [[G2400]] Lord, [[G2962]] here [are] [[G5602]] two [[G1417]] swords.” [[G3162]] “That is [[G1510]] enough,” [[G2425]] He answered. [[G2036]]

### 39
[Jesus] went out [[G1831]] as usual [[G2596]] to [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] Mount [[G3735]] of Olives, [[G1636]] and [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] disciples [[G3101]] followed [[G190]] Him. [[G846]]

### 40
When [[G1161]] He came [[G1096]] to [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] place, [[G5117]] He told [[G2036]] them, [[G846]] “Pray [[G4336]] that you will not enter [[G1525]] into [[G1519]] temptation.” [[G3986]]

### 41
And [[G2532]] He [[G846]] withdrew [[G645]] about [[G5616]] a stone’s [[G3037]] throw [[G1000]] beyond [[G575]] them, [[G846]] [where] [[G2532]] He knelt down [[G5087]] [and] prayed, [[G4336]]

### 42
“Father, [[G3962]] if [[G1487]] You are willing, [[G1014]] take [[G3911]] this [[G3778]] cup [[G4221]] from [[G575]] Me. [[G1473]] Yet [[G4133]] not [[G3361]] My [[G1473]] will, [[G2307]] but [[G235]] Yours [[G4674]] be done.” [[G1096]]

### 43
Then [[G1161]] an angel [[G32]] from [[G575]] heaven [[G3772]] appeared [[G3708]] to Him [[G846]] [and] strengthened [[G1765]] Him. [[G846]]

### 44
And [[G2532]] in [His] [[G1722]] anguish, [[G74]] He prayed [[G4336]] more earnestly, [[G1617]] and [[G2532]] His [[G846]] sweat [[G2402]] became [[G1096]] like [[G5616]] drops [[G2361]] of blood [[G129]] falling [[G2597]] to [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] ground. [[G1093]]

### 45
When [[G2532]] [Jesus] rose [[G450]] from [[G575]] prayer [[G4335]] [and] returned [[G2064]] to [[G4314]] the [[G3588]] disciples, [[G3101]] He found [[G2147]] them [[G846]] asleep, [[G2837]] exhausted from [[G575]] sorrow. [[G3077]]

### 46
“Why [[G5101]] are you sleeping?” [[G2518]] He asked. [[G2036]] “Get up [[G450]] [and] pray [[G4336]] so that [[G2443]] you will not enter [[G1525]] into [[G1519]] temptation.” [[G3986]]

### 47
While [[G2089]] He [[G846]] was still speaking, [[G2980]] a crowd [[G3793]] arrived, [[G2400]] led by [[G4281]] the [man] [[G3588]] called [[G3004]] Judas, [[G2455]] one [[G1520]] of the [[G3588]] Twelve. [[G1427]] He approached [[G1448]] Jesus [[G2424]] to kiss [[G5368]] Him. [[G846]]

### 48
But [[G1161]] Jesus [[G2424]] asked [[G2036]] him, [[G846]] “Judas, [[G2455]] are you betraying [[G3860]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of Man [[G444]] with a kiss?” [[G5370]]

### 49
Those [[G3588]] around [[G4012]] [Jesus] [[G846]] saw [[G3708]] what [[G3588]] was about to happen [[G1510]] [and] said, [[G2036]] “Lord, [[G2962]] should we strike [[G3960]] with [[G1722]] [our] swords?” [[G3162]]

### 50
And [[G2532]] one [[G1520]] of [[G1537]] them [[G846]] struck [[G3960]] the [[G3588]] servant [[G1401]] of the [[G3588]] high priest, [[G749]] cutting off [[G851]] his [[G846]] right [[G1188]] ear. [[G3775]]

### 51
But [[G1161]] Jesus [[G2424]] answered, [[G611]] “No more [[G1439]] of this!” [[G3778]] And [[G2532]] [He] touched [[G680]] the [man’s] [[G3588]] ear [[G5621]] [and] healed [[G2390]] him. [[G846]]

### 52
Then [[G1161]] Jesus [[G2424]] said [[G2036]] to [[G4314]] [the] chief priests, [[G749]] temple officers, [[G4755]] and [[G2532]] elders [[G4245]] who [[G3588]] had come [[G3854]] for [[G1909]] Him, [[G846]] “Have you come out [[G1831]] with [[G3326]] swords [[G3162]] and [[G2532]] clubs [[G3586]] as [[G5613]] [you would] against [[G1909]] an outlaw? [[G3027]]

### 53
Every [[G2596]] day [[G2250]] I [[G1473]] was [[G1510]] with [[G3326]] you [[G4771]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] temple courts, [[G2411]] [and] you did not lay [[G1614]] a [[G3588]] hand [[G5495]] on [[G1909]] Me. [[G1473]] But [[G235]] this [[G3778]] hour [[G5610]] belongs [[G1510]] to you [[G4771]] and [[G2532]] to the [[G3588]] power [[G1849]] of darkness. [[G4655]]

### 54
Then [[G1161]] they seized [[G4815]] [Jesus], [[G846]] led [Him] away, [[G71]] and [[G2532]] took [Him] [[G1521]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] house [[G3614]] of the [[G3588]] high priest. [[G749]] And [[G1161]] Peter [[G4074]] followed [[G190]] at a distance. [[G3113]]

### 55
[When] [[G1161]] [those present] had kindled [[G681]] a fire [[G4442]] in [[G1722]] [the] middle [[G3319]] of the [[G3588]] courtyard [[G833]] and [[G2532]] sat down together, [[G4776]] Peter [[G4074]] sat down [[G2521]] among [[G3319]] them. [[G846]]

### 56
A [[G5100]] servant girl [[G3814]] saw [[G3708]] him [[G846]] seated [[G2521]] in [[G4314]] the [[G3588]] firelight [[G5457]] and [[G2532]] looked intently at [[G816]] him. [[G846]] “This [man] [[G3778]] was [[G1510]] also [[G2532]] with [[G4862]] Him,” [[G846]] she said. [[G2036]]

### 57
But [[G1161]] [Peter] denied [it]. [[G720]] “Woman, [[G1135]] I do not know [[G1492]] Him,” [[G846]] he said. [[G3004]]

### 58
A short time [[G1024]] later, [[G3326]] someone else [[G2087]] saw [[G3708]] him [[G846]] [and] said, [[G5346]] “You [[G4771]] also [[G2532]] are [[G1510]] one of [[G1537]] them.” [[G846]] But [[G1161]] Peter [[G4074]] said, [[G5346]] “Man, [[G444]] I am [[G1510]] not.” [[G3756]]

### 59
About [[G5616]] an [[G1520]] hour [[G5610]] later, [[G1339]] another [man] [[G243]] insisted, [[G1340]] “Certainly [[G225]] this [man] [[G3778]] was [[G1510]] with [[G3326]] Him, [[G846]] for [[G1063]] he too is [[G1510]] a Galilean.” [[G1057]]

### 60
“Man, [[G444]] I do not know [[G1492]] what [[G3739]] you are talking about,” [[G3004]] Peter [[G4074]] replied. [[G2036]] While [[G2089]] he [[G846]] was still speaking, [[G2980]] the rooster [[G220]] crowed. [[G5455]]

### 61
And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] turned [[G4762]] [and] looked at [[G1689]] Peter. [[G4074]] Then [[G2532]] Peter [[G4074]] remembered [[G5279]] the [[G3588]] word [[G3056]] the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] had spoken [[G2036]] to him: [[G846]] “Before [[G4250]] [the] rooster [[G220]] crows [[G5455]] today, [[G4594]] you will deny [[G533]] Me [[G1473]] three times. [[G5151]]

### 62
And [[G2532]] he went [[G1831]] outside [[G1854]] [and] wept [[G2799]] bitterly. [[G4090]]

### 63
The [[G3588]] men [[G435]] who [[G3588]] were holding [[G4912]] [Jesus] [[G846]] began to mock [[G1702]] Him [[G846]] [and] beat [Him]. [[G1194]]

### 64
They [[G2532]] blindfolded [[G4028]] Him [[G846]] [and] kept demanding, [[G1905]] “Prophesy! [[G4395]] Who [[G5101]] hit [[G3817]] You?” [[G4771]]

### 65
And [[G2532]] they said [[G2036]] many {other} [[G4183]] blasphemous [[G987]] things [[G2087]] against [[G1519]] Him. [[G846]]

### 66
At daybreak [[G2250]] the [[G3588]] council of the elders [[G4244]] of the [[G3588]] people, [[G2992]] both [[G5037]] [the] chief priests [[G749]] and [[G2532]] scribes, [[G1122]] met together. [[G4863]] They led [[G520]] Jesus [[G846]] into [[G1519]] their [[G846]] council [[G4892]] [and] said, [[G3004]]

### 67
“If [[G1487]] You [[G4771]] are [[G1510]] the [[G3588]] Christ, [[G5547]] tell [[G2036]] us.” [[G1473]] [Jesus] answered, [[G2036]] “If [[G1437]] I tell [[G2036]] you, [[G4771]] you will not believe. [[G4100]]

### 68
And [[G1161]] if [[G1437]] I ask [you] a question, [[G2065]] you will not answer. [[G611]]

### 69
But [[G1161]] from [[G575]] now on [[G3568]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of Man [[G444]] will be [[G1510]] seated [[G2521]] at [[G1537]] [the] right hand [[G1188]] of the [[G3588]] power [[G1411]] of God.” [[G2316]]

### 70
So [[G1161]] they all asked, [[G2036]] “Are [[G1510]] You [[G4771]] then [[G3767]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of God?” [[G2316]] He replied, [[G5346]] “You [[G4771]] say [[G3004]] that [[G3754]] I [[G1473]] am.” [[G1510]]

### 71
“Why [[G5101]] do we need [[G2192]] any more [[G2089]] testimony?” [[G3141]] they declared. [[G2036]] “We have heard [it] [[G191]] for [[G1063]] ourselves [[G846]] from [[G575]] His own [[G846]] lips.” [[G4750]]
