###### 1
Now [[G1161]] all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] tax collectors [[G5057]] and [[G2532]] sinners [[G268]] were [[G1510]] gathering around [[G1448]] to listen to [[G191]] [Jesus]. [[G846]]

###### 2
So [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] Pharisees [[G5330]] and [[G2532]] scribes [[G1122]] began to grumble: [[G1234]] “This [man] [[G3778]] welcomes [[G4327]] sinners [[G268]] and [[G2532]] eats with [[G4906]] them.” [[G846]]

###### 3
Then [[G1161]] [Jesus] told [[G2036]] them [[G846]] this [[G3778]] parable: [[G3850]]

###### 4
“What [[G5101]] man [[G444]] among [[G1537]] you, [[G4771]] [if] he has [[G2192]] a hundred [[G1540]] sheep [[G4263]] and [[G2532]] loses [[G622]] one [[G1520]] of [[G1537]] them, [[G846]] {does} not [[G3756]] leave [[G2641]] the [[G3588]] ninety-nine [[G1768]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] pasture [[G2048]] and [[G2532]] go [[G4198]] after [[G1909]] the [one] [[G3588]] that is lost, [[G622]] until [[G2193]] he finds [[G2147]] it? [[G846]]

###### 5
And [[G2532]] when he finds [it], [[G2147]] he joyfully puts [it] [[G2007]] on [[G1909]] his [[G846]] shoulders, [[G5606]]

###### 6
comes [[G2064]] home, [[G3624]] [and] calls together [[G4779]] [his] [[G3588]] friends [[G5384]] and [[G2532]] neighbors [[G1069]] to tell [[G3004]] them, [[G846]] ‘Rejoice with [[G4796]] me, [[G1473]] for [[G3754]] I have found [[G2147]] my [[G1473]] lost [[G622]] sheep!’ [[G4263]]

###### 7
In the same way, [[G3779]] I tell [[G3004]] you [[G4771]] that [[G3754]] there will be [more] [[G1510]] joy [[G5479]] in [[G1722]] heaven [[G3772]] over [[G1909]] one [[G1520]] sinner [[G268]] who repents [[G3340]] than [[G2228]] over [[G1909]] ninety-nine [[G1768]] righteous ones [[G1342]] who [[G3748]] do [[G2192]] not [[G3756]] need [[G5532]] to repent. [[G3341]]

###### 8
Or [[G2228]] what [[G5101]] woman [[G1135]] who has [[G2192]] ten [[G1176]] silver coins [[G1406]] [and] [[G1437]] loses [[G622]] one [[G1520]] [of them] [[G1406]] {does} not [[G3780]] light [[G681]] a lamp, [[G3088]] sweep [[G4563]] [her] [[G3588]] house, [[G3614]] and [[G2532]] search [[G2212]] carefully [[G1960]] until [[G2193]] she finds [[G2147]] it? [[G3739]]

###### 9
And [[G2532]] when she finds [it], [[G2147]] she calls together [[G4779]] [her] [[G3588]] friends [[G5384]] and [[G2532]] neighbors [[G1069]] to say, [[G3004]] ‘Rejoice with [[G4796]] me, [[G1473]] for [[G3754]] I have found [[G2147]] [my] [[G3588]] lost [[G622]] coin.’ [[G1406]]

###### 10
In the same way, [[G3779]] I tell [[G3004]] you, [[G4771]] there is [[G1096]] joy [[G5479]] in the presence [[G1799]] of God’s [[G2316]] angels [[G32]] over [[G1909]] one [[G1520]] sinner [[G268]] who repents.” [[G3340]]

###### 11
Then [[G1161]] [Jesus] said, [[G2036]] “[There was] a [[G5100]] man [[G444]] who had [[G2192]] two [[G1417]] sons. [[G5207]]

###### 12
The [[G3588]] younger [[G3501]] [son] [[G846]] said [[G2036]] to [[G3588]] [him], [[G3962]] ‘Father, [[G3962]] give [[G1325]] me [[G1473]] my [[G1911]] share [[G3313]] of the [[G3588]] estate.’ [[G3776]] So [[G1161]] he divided [[G1244]] [his] [[G3588]] property [[G979]] between them. [[G846]]

###### 13
After [[G3326]] a few [[G4183]] days, [[G2250]] the [[G3588]] younger [[G3501]] son [[G5207]] got everything together [[G4863]] [and] journeyed [[G589]] to [[G1519]] a distant [[G3117]] country, [[G5561]] [where] [[G1563]] he squandered [[G1287]] his [[G846]] wealth [[G3776]] in wild [[G811]] living. [[G2198]]

###### 14
After [[G1161]] he [[G846]] had spent [[G1159]] all [he had], [[G3956]] a severe [[G2478]] famine [[G3042]] swept [[G1096]] through [[G2596]] that [[G1565]] country, [[G5561]] and [[G2532]] he [[G846]] began [[G756]] to be in need. [[G5302]]

###### 15
[So] [[G2532]] he went [[G4198]] [and] hired himself out [[G2853]] to a [[G1520]] citizen [[G4177]] of that [[G1565]] country, [[G5561]] [who] [[G2532]] sent [[G3992]] him [[G846]] into [[G1519]] his [[G846]] fields [[G68]] to feed [[G1006]] [the] pigs. [[G5519]]

###### 16
He longed [[G1937]] to fill [[G1072]] his [[G846]] belly [[G2836]] with [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] pods [[G2769]] the [[G3588]] pigs [[G5519]] were eating, [[G2068]] but [[G2532]] no one [[G3762]] would give [[G1325]] him [ a thing ]. [[G846]]

###### 17
Finally [[G1161]] he came [[G2064]] to [[G1519]] his senses [[G1438]] [and] said, [[G5346]] ‘How many [[G4214]] of [[G3588]] my [[G1473]] father’s [[G3962]] hired servants [[G3407]] have plenty [[G4052]] of food? [[G740]] But [[G1161]] here [[G5602]] I {am}, [[G1473]] starving [[G3042]] to death! [[G622]]

###### 18
I will get up [[G450]] [and] go back [[G4198]] to [[G4314]] my [[G1473]] father [[G3962]] and [[G2532]] say [[G2046]] to him, [[G846]] “Father, [[G3962]] I have sinned [[G264]] against [[G1519]] heaven [[G3772]] and [[G2532]] against [[G1799]] you. [[G4771]]

###### 19
I am [[G1510]] no longer [[G3765]] worthy [[G514]] to be called [[G2564]] your [[G4771]] son. [[G5207]] Make [[G4160]] me [[G1473]] like [[G5613]] one [[G1520]] of [[G3588]] your [[G4771]] hired servants.”’ [[G3407]]

###### 20
So [[G2532]] he got up [[G450]] [and] went [[G2064]] to [[G4314]] his [[G1438]] father. [[G3962]] But while [[G1161]] he {was} [[G846]] still [[G2089]] in the distance, [[G568]] his [[G846]] father [[G3962]] saw [[G3708]] him [[G846]] and [[G2532]] was filled with compassion. [[G4697]] He ran [to his son], [[G5143]] embraced him, [[G1968]] and [[G2532]] kissed [[G2705]] him. [[G846]]

###### 21
The [[G3588]] son [[G5207]] declared, [[G2036]] ‘Father, [[G3962]] I have sinned [[G264]] against [[G1519]] heaven [[G3772]] and [[G2532]] against [[G1799]] you. [[G4771]] I am [[G1510]] no longer [[G3765]] worthy [[G514]] to be called [[G2564]] your [[G4771]] son.’ [[G5207]]

###### 22
But [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] father [[G3962]] said [[G2036]] to [[G4314]] his [[G846]] servants, [[G1401]] ‘Quick! [[G5035]] Bring [[G1627]] the [[G3588]] best [[G4413]] robe [[G4749]] and [[G2532]] put it on [[G1746]] him. [[G846]] Put [[G1325]] a ring [[G1146]] on [[G1519]] his [[G846]] finger [[G5495]] and [[G2532]] sandals [[G5266]] on [[G1519]] his [[G3588]] feet. [[G4228]]

###### 23
Bring [[G5342]] the [[G3588]] fatted [[G4618]] calf [[G3448]] [and] kill [it]. [[G2380]] Let us feast [[G5315]] [and] celebrate. [[G2165]]

###### 24
For [[G3754]] this [[G3778]] son [[G5207]] of mine [[G1473]] was [[G1510]] dead [[G3498]] and [[G2532]] is alive again! [[G326]] He was [[G1510]] lost [[G622]] and [[G2532]] is found!’ [[G2147]] So [[G2532]] they began [[G756]] to celebrate. [[G2165]]

###### 25
Meanwhile [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] older [[G4245]] son [[G5207]] was [[G1510]] in [[G1722]] [the] field, [[G68]] and [[G2532]] as [[G5613]] he approached [[G2064]] the [[G3588]] house, [[G3614]] he heard [[G191]] music [[G4858]] and [[G2532]] dancing. [[G5525]]

###### 26
So [[G2532]] he called [[G4341]] one [[G1520]] of the [[G3588]] servants [[G3816]] [and] asked [[G4441]] what [[G5101]] was going on. [[G3778]]

###### 27
‘Your [[G4771]] brother [[G80]] has returned,’ [[G2240]] he said, [[G2036]] ‘and [[G2532]] your [[G4771]] father [[G3962]] has killed [[G2380]] the [[G3588]] fatted [[G4618]] calf, [[G3448]] because [[G3754]] he has him back [[G618]] safe and sound.’ [[G5198]]

###### 28
[The older son] became angry [[G3710]] and [[G2532]] refused [[G2309]] to go in. [[G1525]] So [[G1161]] his [[G846]] father [[G3962]] came out [[G1831]] [and] pleaded with [[G3870]] him. [[G846]]

###### 29
But [[G1161]] he answered [[G611]] his [[G846]] father, [[G3962]] ‘Look, [[G2400]] all these [[G5118]] years [[G2094]] I have served [[G1398]] you [[G4771]] and [[G2532]] never [[G3763]] disobeyed [[G3928]] a commandment [[G1785]] of yours. [[G4771]] Yet [[G2532]] you never gave [[G1325]] me [[G1473]] [even] a young goat [[G2056]] so [[G2443]] I could celebrate [[G2165]] with [[G3326]] my [[G1473]] friends. [[G5384]]

###### 30
But [[G1161]] when [[G3753]] this [[G3778]] son [[G5207]] of yours [[G4771]] returns from [[G2064]] squandering [[G2719]] your [[G4771]] wealth [[G979]] with [[G3326]] prostitutes, [[G4204]] you kill [[G2380]] the [[G3588]] fatted [[G4618]] calf [[G3448]] for him!’ [[G846]]

###### 31
‘Son, [[G5043]] you [[G4771]] are [[G1510]] always [[G3842]] with [[G3326]] me,’ [[G1473]] [the father] said, [[G2036]] ‘and [[G2532]] all [[G3956]] that [[G3588]] [is] mine [[G1699]] is [[G1510]] yours. [[G4674]]

###### 32
But [[G1161]] it was fitting [[G1163]] to celebrate [[G2165]] and [[G2532]] rejoice, [[G5463]] because [[G3754]] this [[G3778]] brother [[G80]] of yours [[G4771]] was [[G1510]] dead [[G3498]] and [[G2532]] is alive again; [[G2198]] he was lost [[G622]] and [[G2532]] is found.’” [[G2147]]
