###### 1
Then [[G1161]] [Jesus] looked up [[G308]] [and] saw [[G3708]] the [[G3588]] rich [[G4145]] putting [[G906]] their [[G846]] gifts [[G1435]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] treasury, [[G1049]]

###### 2
and [[G1161]] He saw [[G3708]] a [[G5100]] poor [[G3998]] widow [[G5503]] put [[G906]] in [[G1563]] two [[G1417]] small copper coins. [[G3016]]

###### 3
“Truly [[G230]] I tell [[G3004]] you,” [[G4771]] He said, [[G2036]] “this [[G3778]] poor [[G4434]] widow [[G5503]] has put in [[G906]] more [[G4119]] than all [the others]. [[G3956]]

###### 4
For [[G1063]] they all [[G3956]] contributed [[G906]] out of [[G1537]] their [[G846]] surplus, [[G4052]] but [[G1161]] she [[G3778]] out of [[G1537]] her [[G846]] poverty [[G5303]] has put in [[G906]] all [[G3956]] she had [[G2192]] to live on.” [[G979]]

###### 5
As [[G2532]] some [of the disciples] [[G5100]] were remarking [[G3004]] how [[G3754]] the [[G3588]] temple [[G2411]] was adorned [[G2885]] with beautiful [[G2570]] stones [[G3037]] and [[G2532]] consecrated gifts, [[G334]] [Jesus] said, [[G2036]]

###### 6
“[As for] what [[G3778]] you see here, [[G2334]] [the] time [[G2250]] will come [[G2064]] [when] [[G3739]] not one [[G3756]] stone [[G3037]] will be left [[G863]] on [[G1909]] [another]; [[G3037]] [every one] [[G3739]] will be toppled.” [[G2647]]

###### 7
“Teacher,” [[G1320]] they asked, [[G1905]] “when {will} [[G4219]] these things [[G3778]] happen? [[G1510]] And [[G2532]] what [will be] [[G5101]] the [[G3588]] sign [[G4592]] [that] [[G3752]] they [[G3778]] are about [[G3195]] to take place?” [[G1096]]

###### 8
[Jesus] answered, [[G2036]] “See to it [[G991]] that you are not deceived. [[G4105]] For [[G1063]] many [[G4183]] will come [[G2064]] in [[G1909]] My [[G1473]] name, [[G3686]] claiming, [[G3004]] ‘I [[G1473]] am [He],’ [[G1510]] and, [[G2532]] ‘The [[G3588]] time [[G2540]] is near.’ [[G1448]] {Do} not [[G3361]] follow [[G4198]] them. [[G846]]

###### 9
When [[G3752]] you hear of [[G191]] wars [[G4171]] and [[G2532]] rebellions, [[G181]] {do} not [[G3361]] be alarmed. [[G4422]] These things [[G3778]] must [[G1163]] happen [[G1096]] first, [[G4412]] but [[G235]] the [[G3588]] end [[G5056]] [is] not [[G3756]] imminent.” [[G2112]]

###### 10
Then [[G5119]] He told [[G2036]] them, [[G846]] “Nation [[G1484]] will rise [[G1453]] against [[G1909]] nation, [[G1484]] and [[G2532]] kingdom [[G932]] against [[G1909]] kingdom. [[G932]]

###### 11
There will be [[G1510]] great [[G3173]] earthquakes, [[G4578]] famines, [[G3042]] and [[G2532]] pestilences [[G3061]] in various [[G2596]] places, [[G5117]] along with [[G5037]] fearful sights [[G5400]] and [[G2532]] great [[G3173]] signs [[G4592]] from [[G575]] heaven. [[G3772]]

###### 12
But [[G1161]] before [[G4253]] all [[G3956]] [this], [[G3778]] they will seize [[G1911]] you [[G4771]] and [[G2532]] persecute [you]. [[G1377]] On account of [[G1752]] My [[G1473]] name, [[G3686]] they will deliver you [[G3860]] to [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] synagogues [[G4864]] and [[G2532]] prisons, [[G5438]] [and] they will bring [you] [[G520]] before [[G1909]] kings [[G935]] and [[G2532]] governors. [[G2232]]

###### 13
This will be your opportunity [[G576]] to [[G1519]] serve as witnesses. [[G3142]]

###### 14
So [[G3767]] make up [[G5087]] your [[G4771]] mind [[G2588]] not [[G3361]] to worry beforehand [[G4304]] how to defend yourselves. [[G626]]

###### 15
For [[G1063]] I [[G1473]] will give [[G1325]] you [[G4771]] speech [[G4750]] and [[G2532]] wisdom [[G4678]] that [[G3739]] none of [[G3756]] your adversaries [[G480]] will be able to [[G1410]] resist [[G436]] [or] [[G2228]] contradict. [[G483]]

###### 16
You will be betrayed [[G3860]] even [[G2532]] by [[G5259]] parents [[G1118]] and [[G2532]] brothers [[G80]] and [[G2532]] relatives [[G4773]] and [[G2532]] friends, [[G5384]] and [[G2532]] [some] of [[G1537]] you [[G4771]] will be put to death. [[G2289]]

###### 17
And [[G2532]] you will be [[G1510]] hated [[G3404]] by [[G5259]] everyone [[G3956]] because of [[G1223]] My [[G1473]] name. [[G3686]]

###### 18
Yet [[G2532]] not even [[G3361]] a hair [[G2359]] of [[G1537]] your [[G4771]] head [[G2776]] will perish. [[G622]]

###### 19
By [[G1722]] your [[G4771]] patient endurance, [[G5281]] you will gain [[G2932]] your [[G4771]] souls. [[G5590]]

###### 20
But [[G1161]] when [[G3752]] you see [[G3708]] Jerusalem [[G2419]] surrounded [[G2944]] by [[G5259]] armies, [[G4760]] you will know [[G1097]] that [[G3754]] her [[G846]] desolation [[G2050]] is near. [[G1448]]

###### 21
Then [[G5119]] {let} those [[G3588]] in [[G1722]] Judea [[G2449]] flee [[G5343]] to [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] mountains, [[G3735]] {let} [[G2532]] those [[G3588]] in [[G1722]] [the city] [[G3319]] get out, [[G1633]] and {let} [[G2532]] those [[G3588]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] country [[G5561]] stay out of [[G1525]] [the city]. [[G846]]

###### 22
For [[G3754]] these [[G3778]] are [[G1510]] [the] days [[G2250]] of vengeance, [[G1557]] to fulfill [[G4130]] all [[G3956]] that is written. [[G1125]]

###### 23
How miserable [[G3759]] those [[G1565]] days [will be] [[G2250]] [for] pregnant [[G2192]] and [[G2532]] nursing [mothers]. [[G2337]] For [[G1063]] there will be [[G1510]] great [[G3173]] distress [[G318]] upon [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] land [[G1093]] and [[G2532]] wrath [[G3709]] against [[G3588]] this [[G3778]] people. [[G2992]]

###### 24
They will fall [[G4098]] by [the] edge [[G4750]] of [the] sword [[G3162]] and [[G2532]] be led captive [[G163]] into [[G1519]] all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] nations. [[G1484]] And [[G2532]] Jerusalem [[G2419]] will be [[G1510]] trodden down [[G3961]] by [[G5259]] [the] Gentiles, [[G1484]] until [[G891]] [the] times [[G2540]] of [the] Gentiles [[G1484]] are fulfilled. [[G4137]]

###### 25
There will be [[G1510]] signs [[G4592]] in [[G1722]] [the] sun [[G2246]] and [[G2532]] moon [[G4582]] and [[G2532]] stars, [[G798]] and [[G2532]] on [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] earth [[G1093]] dismay [[G4928]] among the nations, [[G1484]] bewildered [[G640]] by [[G1722]] [the] roaring [[G2279]] of [the] sea [[G2281]] and [[G2532]] [the] surging of the waves. [[G4535]]

###### 26
Men [[G444]] will faint [[G674]] from [[G575]] fear [[G5401]] and [[G2532]] anxiety [[G4329]] over what [[G3588]] is coming [[G1904]] upon the [[G3588]] earth, [[G3625]] for [[G1063]] the [[G3588]] powers [[G1411]] of the [[G3588]] heavens [[G3772]] will be shaken. [[G4531]]

###### 27
At that time [[G5119]] they will see [[G3708]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of Man [[G444]] coming [[G2064]] in [[G1722]] a cloud [[G3507]] with [[G3326]] power [[G1411]] and [[G2532]] great [[G4183]] glory. [[G1391]]

###### 28
When [[G1161]] these things [[G3778]] begin [[G756]] to happen, [[G1096]] stand up [[G352]] and [[G2532]] lift up [[G1869]] your [[G4771]] heads, [[G2776]] because [[G1360]] your [[G4771]] redemption [[G629]] is drawing near.” [[G1448]]

###### 29
Then [[G2532]] [Jesus] told [[G2036]] them [[G846]] a parable: [[G3850]] “Look at [[G3708]] the [[G3588]] fig tree [[G4808]] and [[G2532]] all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] trees. [[G1186]]

###### 30
When [[G3752]] they sprout leaves, [[G4261]] you can see [[G991]] for [[G575]] yourselves [[G1438]] [and] know [[G1097]] that [[G3754]] summer [[G2330]] is [[G1510]] near. [[G1451]]

###### 31
So [[G3779]] also, [[G2532]] when [[G3752]] you see [[G3708]] these things [[G3778]] taking place, [[G1096]] you [[G4771]] will know [[G1097]] that [[G3754]] the [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] of God [[G2316]] is [[G1510]] near. [[G1451]]

###### 32
Truly [[G281]] I tell [[G3004]] you, [[G4771]] this [[G3778]] generation [[G1074]] will not pass away [[G3928]] until [[G2193]] all [these things] [[G3956]] have happened. [[G1096]]

###### 33
Heaven [[G3772]] and [[G2532]] earth [[G1093]] will pass away, [[G3928]] but [[G1161]] My [[G1473]] words [[G3056]] will never pass away. [[G3928]]

###### 34
But [[G1161]] watch [[G4337]] yourselves, [[G1438]] or [[G3361]] your [[G4771]] hearts [[G2588]] will be weighed down [[G916]] by [[G1722]] dissipation, [[G2897]] drunkenness, [[G3178]] and [[G2532]] [the] worries [[G3308]] of life— [[G982]] and [[G2532]] that [[G1565]] day [[G2250]] will spring [[G2186]] upon [[G1909]] you [[G4771]] suddenly [[G160]] like [[G5613]] a snare. [[G3803]]

###### 35
For [[G1063]] it will come [[G1904]] upon [[G1909]] all [[G3956]] who [[G3588]] dwell [[G2521]] on [[G1909]] the face [[G4383]] of the [[G3588]] whole [[G3956]] earth. [[G1093]]

###### 36
[So] [[G1161]] keep watch [[G69]] at [[G1722]] all [[G3956]] times, [[G2540]] [and] pray [[G1189]] that [[G2443]] you may have the strength [[G2729]] to escape [[G1628]] all [[G3956]] that [[G3588]] is about [[G3195]] to happen [[G1096]] and [[G2532]] to stand [[G2476]] before [[G1715]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of Man.” [[G444]]

###### 37
[Every] [[G3588]] day [[G2250]] [Jesus] [[G1510]] taught [[G1321]] at [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] temple, [[G2411]] but [[G1161]] [every] [[G3588]] evening [[G3571]] He went out [[G1831]] to spend the night [[G835]] on [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] Mount [[G3735]] of [[G2564]] Olives. [[G1636]]

###### 38
And [[G2532]] early in the morning [[G3719]] all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] people {would come} [[G2992]] to hear [[G191]] Him [[G846]] at [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] temple. [[G2411]]
