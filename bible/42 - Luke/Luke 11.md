### 1
[One day] [[G2532]] in [[G1722]] a [[G5100]] place [[G5117]] where [[G5613]] [Jesus] [[G846]] had just finished [[G3973]] praying, [[G4336]] one [[G5100]] of His [[G846]] disciples [[G3101]] requested, [[G2036]] “Lord, [[G2962]] teach [[G1321]] us [[G1473]] to pray, [[G4336]] just [[G2532]] as [[G2531]] John [[G2491]] taught [[G1321]] his [[G846]] disciples. [[G3101]]

### 2
So [[G1161]] [Jesus] told [[G2036]] them, [[G846]] “When [[G3752]] you pray, [[G4336]] say: [[G3004]] ‘Father, [[G3962]] hallowed be [[G37]] Your [[G4771]] name. [[G3686]] Your [[G4771]] kingdom [[G932]] come. [[G2064]]

### 3
Give [[G1325]] us [[G1473]] each [[G2596]] day [[G2250]] our [[G1473]] daily [[G1967]] bread. [[G740]]

### 4
And [[G2532]] forgive [[G863]] us [[G1473]] our [[G1473]] sins, [[G266]] for [[G1063]] we [[G846]] also [[G2532]] forgive [[G863]] everyone who [[G3956]] sins against [[G3784]] us. [[G1473]] And [[G2532]] lead [[G1533]] us [[G1473]] not [[G3361]] into [[G1519]] temptation.’” [[G3986]]

### 5
Then [[G2532]] [Jesus] said [[G2036]] to [[G4314]] them, [[G846]] “[Suppose one] [[G5101]] of [[G1537]] you [[G4771]] goes [[G4198]] to [[G4314]] [his] friend [[G5384]] at midnight [[G3317]] and [[G2532]] says, [[G2036]] ‘Friend, [[G5384]] lend [[G5531]] me [[G1473]] three [[G5140]] loaves [of bread], [[G740]]

### 6
because [[G1894]] [a] friend [[G5384]] of mine [[G1473]] has come [[G3854]] to [[G4314]] me [[G1473]] on [[G1537]] a journey, [[G3598]] and [[G2532]] I have [[G2192]] nothing [[G3756]] to set before [[G3908]] him.’ [[G846]]

### 7
And [the one] [[G2548]] inside [[G2081]] answers, [[G611]] ‘{Do} not [[G3361]] bother [[G2873]] me. [[G1473]] [My] [[G3588]] door [[G2374]] {is} already [[G2235]] shut [[G2808]] and [[G2532]] my [[G1473]] children [[G3813]] are [[G1510]] with [[G3326]] me [[G1473]] in [[G1519]] bed. [[G2845]] I cannot [[G1410]] get up [[G450]] to give [[G1325]] you [anything]. [[G4771]]

### 8
I tell [[G3004]] you, [[G4771]] even [[G2532]] though [[G1487]] he will not get up [[G450]] to provide [[G1325]] for him [[G846]] because of [[G1223]] his [[G846]] friendship, [[G5384]] yet [[G1065]] because of [[G1223]] [the man’s] [[G846]] persistence, [[G335]] he will get up [[G1453]] [and] give [[G1325]] him [[G846]] as much as [[G3745]] he needs. [[G5535]]

### 9
So I [[G2504]] tell [[G3004]] you: [[G4771]] Ask [[G154]] and [[G2532]] it will be given [[G1325]] to you; [[G4771]] seek [[G2212]] and [[G2532]] you will find; [[G2147]] knock [[G2925]] and [[G2532]] [the door] will be opened [[G455]] to you. [[G4771]]

### 10
For [[G1063]] everyone [[G3956]] who asks [[G154]] receives; [[G2983]] he who [[G3588]] seeks [[G2212]] finds; [[G2147]] and [[G2532]] to him who [[G3588]] knocks, [[G2925]] [the door] will be opened. [[G455]]

### 11
What [[G5101]] father [[G3962]] among [[G1537]] you, [[G4771]] [if his] [[G3588]] son [[G5207]] asks for [[G154]] a fish, [[G2486]] will give [[G1929]] him [[G846]] a snake [[G3789]] instead? [[G2532]]

### 12
Or [[G2228]] [if] he asks for [[G154]] an egg, [[G5609]] will give [[G1929]] him [[G846]] a scorpion? [[G4651]]

### 13
So [[G3767]] if [[G1487]] you [[G4771]] who are [[G5225]] evil [[G4190]] know how [[G1492]] to give [[G1325]] good [[G18]] gifts [[G1390]] to [[G3588]] your [[G4771]] children, [[G5043]] how much [[G4214]] more [[G3123]] {will} [your] [[G3588]] Father [[G3962]] in [[G1537]] heaven [[G3772]] give [[G1325]] [the] Holy [[G40]] Spirit [[G4151]] to those who [[G3588]] ask [[G154]] Him! [[G846]]

### 14
[One day] [[G2532]] [Jesus] was [[G1510]] driving out [[G1544]] a demon [[G1140]] that [[G846]] was [[G1510]] mute. [[G2974]] And when [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] demon [[G1140]] was gone, [[G1831]] the [[G3588]] [man who had been] mute [[G2974]] spoke. [[G2980]] The [[G3588]] crowds [[G3793]] were amazed, [[G2296]]

### 15
but [[G1161]] some [[G5100]] of [[G1537]] them [[G846]] said, [[G2036]] “[It is] by [[G1722]] Beelzebul, [[G954]] the [[G3588]] prince [[G758]] of the [[G3588]] demons, [[G1140]] [that] He drives out [[G1544]] demons.” [[G1140]]

### 16
And [[G1161]] others [[G2087]] tested [[G3985]] Him [[G846]] by demanding [[G2212]] a sign [[G4592]] from [[G1537]] heaven. [[G3772]]

### 17
But [[G1161]] [Jesus] [[G846]] knew [[G1492]] their [[G846]] thoughts [[G1270]] [and] said [[G2036]] to them, [[G846]] “Every [[G3956]] kingdom [[G932]] divided [[G1266]] against [[G1909]] itself [[G1438]] will be laid waste, [[G2049]] and [[G2532]] a house [[G3624]] divided against [[G1909]] a house [[G3624]] will fall. [[G4098]]

### 18
If [[G1487]] Satan [[G4567]] is divided [[G1266]] against [[G1909]] himself, [[G1438]] how [[G4459]] {can} his [[G846]] kingdom [[G932]] stand? [[G2476]] After all, [[G3754]] you say that [[G3004]] I [[G1473]] drive out [[G1544]] demons [[G1140]] by [[G1722]] Beelzebul. [[G954]]

### 19
And [[G1161]] if [[G1487]] I [[G1473]] drive out [[G1544]] demons [[G1140]] by [[G1722]] Beelzebul, [[G954]] by [[G1722]] whom [[G5101]] {do} your [[G4771]] sons [[G5207]] drive [them] out? [[G1544]] So then, [[G1223]] they [[G846]] will be [[G1510]] your [[G4771]] judges. [[G2923]]

### 20
But [[G1161]] if [[G1487]] I [[G1473]] drive out [[G1544]] demons [[G1140]] by [[G1722]] [the] finger [[G1147]] of God, [[G2316]] then [[G686]] the [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] of God [[G2316]] has come [[G5348]] upon [[G1909]] you. [[G4771]]

### 21
When [[G3752]] a strong [man], [[G2478]] fully armed, [[G2528]] guards [[G5442]] his [[G1438]] house, [[G833]] his [[G846]] possessions [[G5225]] are [[G1510]] secure. [[G1515]]

### 22
But [[G1161]] when [[G1875]] [someone] stronger [[G2478]] attacks [[G1904]] [and] overpowers [[G3528]] him, [[G846]] he takes away [[G142]] [the] [[G846]] armor [[G3833]] on [[G1909]] which [[G3739]] [the man] relied, [[G3982]] and then [[G2532]] he divides up [[G1239]] his [[G846]] plunder. [[G4661]]

### 23
He who [[G3588]] is [[G1510]] not [[G3361]] with [[G3326]] Me [[G1473]] is [[G1510]] against [[G2596]] Me, [[G1473]] and [[G2532]] he who [[G3588]] does not gather [[G4863]] with [[G3326]] Me [[G1473]] scatters. [[G4650]]

### 24
When [[G3752]] an unclean [[G169]] spirit [[G4151]] comes out [[G1831]] of [[G575]] a man, [[G444]] it passes [[G1330]] through [[G1223]] arid [[G504]] places [[G5117]] seeking [[G2212]] rest [[G372]] and [[G2532]] does not find [it]. [[G2147]] Then [[G5119]] it says, [[G3004]] ‘I will return [[G5290]] to [[G1519]] [the] [[G1473]] house [[G3624]] I left. [[G1831]]

### 25
On its return, [[G2064]] it finds [the house] [[G2147]] swept clean [[G4563]] and [[G2532]] put in order. [[G2885]]

### 26
Then [[G5119]] it goes [[G4198]] and [[G2532]] brings [[G3880]] seven [[G2033]] other [[G2087]] spirits [[G4151]] more evil [[G4190]] than itself, [[G1438]] and [[G2532]] they go in [[G1525]] [and] dwell [[G2730]] there. [[G1563]] And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] final [plight] [[G2078]] of that [[G1565]] man [[G444]] is [[G1096]] worse [[G5501]] than the [[G3588]] first. [[G4413]]

### 27
As [[G1161]] [Jesus] [[G846]] was saying [[G3004]] these things, [[G3778]] a [[G5100]] woman [[G1135]] in [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] crowd [[G3793]] raised [[G1869]] [her] voice [[G5456]] [and] said, [[G2036]] “Blessed [[G3107]] [is] the [[G3588]] womb [[G2836]] that bore [[G941]] You, [[G4771]] and [blessed are] [[G2532]] [the] breasts [[G3149]] that [[G3739]] nursed You. [[G2337]]

### 28
But [[G1161]] He [[G846]] replied, [[G2036]] “Blessed [[G3107]] rather [[G3304]] [are] those who [[G3588]] hear [[G191]] the [[G3588]] word [[G3056]] of God [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] obey it.” [[G5442]]

### 29
As [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] crowds [[G3793]] were increasing, [[G1865]] [Jesus] said, [[G3004]] “This [[G3778]] is [[G1510]] a wicked [[G4190]] generation. [[G1074]] It demands [[G2212]] a sign, [[G4592]] but [[G2532]] none [[G3756]] will be given [[G1325]] it [[G846]] except [[G1487]] the [[G3588]] sign [[G4592]] of Jonah. [[G2495]]

### 30
For [[G1063]] as [[G2531]] Jonah [[G2495]] was [[G1096]] a sign [[G4592]] to the [[G3588]] Ninevites, [[G3536]] so [[G3779]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of Man [[G444]] will be [a sign] [[G1510]] to this [[G3778]] generation. [[G1074]]

### 31
The Queen [[G938]] of [the] South [[G3558]] will rise [[G1453]] at [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] judgment [[G2920]] with [[G3326]] the [[G3588]] men [[G435]] of this [[G3778]] generation [[G1074]] and [[G2532]] condemn [[G2632]] them; [[G846]] for [[G3754]] she came [[G2064]] from [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] ends [[G4009]] of the [[G3588]] earth [[G1093]] to hear [[G191]] the [[G3588]] wisdom [[G4678]] of Solomon, [[G4672]] and [[G2532]] now [[G2400]] [One] greater [[G4119]] than Solomon [[G4672]] [is] here. [[G5602]]

### 32
[The] men [[G435]] of Nineveh [[G3536]] will stand [[G450]] at [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] judgment [[G2920]] with [[G3326]] this [[G3778]] generation [[G1074]] and [[G2532]] condemn [[G2632]] it; [[G846]] for [[G3754]] they repented [[G3340]] at [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] preaching [[G2782]] of Jonah, [[G2495]] and [[G2532]] now [[G2400]] [One] greater [[G4119]] than Jonah [[G2495]] [is] here. [[G5602]]

### 33
No one [[G3762]] lights [[G681]] a lamp [[G3088]] [and] puts it [[G5087]] in [[G1519]] a cellar [[G2926]] [or] [[G3761]] under [[G5259]] a basket. [[G3426]] Instead, [[G235]] [he sets it] on [[G1909]] a lampstand, [[G3087]] so [[G2443]] those [[G3588]] who enter [[G1531]] can see [[G991]] the [[G3588]] light. [[G5338]]

### 34
Your [[G4771]] eye [[G3788]] is [[G1510]] the [[G3588]] lamp [[G3088]] of your [[G3588]] body. [[G4983]] When [[G3752]] your [[G4771]] vision [[G3788]] is [[G1510]] clear, [[G573]] your [[G4771]] whole [[G3650]] body [[G4983]] also [[G2532]] is [[G1510]] full of light. [[G5460]] But [[G1161]] when [[G1875]] it is [[G1510]] poor, [[G4190]] your [[G4771]] body [[G4983]] [is] full of darkness. [[G4652]]

### 35
Be careful, [[G4648]] then, [[G3767]] [that] the [[G3588]] light [[G5457]] within [[G1722]] you [[G4771]] is [[G1510]] not [[G3361]] darkness. [[G4655]]

### 36
So [[G3767]] if [[G1487]] your [[G4771]] [whole] [[G3588]] body [[G4983]] [is] full [[G3650]] of light, [[G5460]] [and] no [[G3361]] part [of it] [[G3313]] in darkness, [[G4652]] [you] will be [[G1510]] radiant, [[G5460]] as [[G5613]] though [[G3752]] a lamp [[G3088]] were shining [[G796]] on you.” [[G4771]]

### 37
As [[G1722]] [Jesus] was speaking, [[G2980]] a Pharisee [[G5330]] invited [[G2065]] Him [[G846]] to [[G3704]] dine [[G709]] with [[G3844]] him; [[G846]] [so] [[G1161]] He went in [[G1525]] [and] reclined at the table. [[G377]]

### 38
But [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] Pharisee [[G5330]] was astonished [[G2296]] to see [[G3708]] that [[G3754]] [Jesus] did not first wash [[G907]] before [[G4253]] the [[G3588]] meal. [[G712]]

### 39
“Now then,” [[G3568]] said [[G2036]] the [[G3588]] Lord, [[G2962]] “you [[G4771]] Pharisees [[G5330]] clean [[G2511]] the [[G3588]] outside [[G1855]] of the [[G3588]] cup [[G4221]] and [[G2532]] dish, [[G4094]] but [[G1161]] inside [[G2081]] you [[G4771]] are full [[G1073]] of greed [[G724]] and [[G2532]] wickedness. [[G4189]]

### 40
[You] fools! [[G878]] [Did] not [[G3756]] the [One who] [[G3588]] made [[G4160]] the [[G3588]] outside [[G1855]] make [[G4160]] the [[G3588]] inside [[G2081]] as well? [[G2532]]

### 41
But [[G4133]] give [[G1325]] [as] alms [[G1654]] the things that [[G3588]] are within [you], [[G1751]] and [[G2532]] you will see [[G2400]] [that] everything [[G3956]] is [[G1510]] clean [[G2513]] for you. [[G4771]]

### 42
Woe [[G3759]] to you [[G4771]] Pharisees! [[G5330]] You pay tithes of [[G586]] mint [[G2238]] and [[G2532]] rue [[G4076]] and [[G2532]] every [[G3956]] herb, [[G3001]] but [[G2532]] you disregard [[G3928]] justice [[G2920]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] love [[G26]] of God. [[G2316]] You should have [[G1163]] practiced [[G4160]] [the latter] [[G3778]] without [[G3361]] neglecting [[G3935]] [the former]. [[G2548]]

### 43
Woe [[G3759]] to you [[G4771]] Pharisees! [[G5330]] You love [[G25]] the [[G3588]] chief seats [[G4410]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] synagogues [[G4864]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] greetings [[G783]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] marketplaces. [[G58]]

### 44
Woe [[G3759]] to you! [[G4771]] For [[G3754]] you are [[G1510]] like [[G5613]] unmarked [[G82]] graves, [[G3419]] [which] [[G2532]] men [[G444]] walk across [[G4043]] without [[G3756]] [even] noticing.” [[G1492]]

### 45
One [[G5100]] of the [[G3588]] experts in the law [[G3544]] told [[G3004]] Him, [[G846]] “Teacher, [[G1320]] when You say [[G3004]] these things, [[G3778]] You insult [[G5195]] us [[G1473]] as well.” [[G2532]]

### 46
“Woe [[G3759]] to you [[G4771]] as well, [[G2532]] experts in the law!” [[G3544]] He replied. [[G2036]] “You weigh men down [[G5412]] [with] heavy burdens, [[G5413]] but [[G2532]] you yourselves [[G846]] will not lift [[G4379]] a [[G1520]] finger {to lighten} [[G1147]] [their] [[G3588]] load. [[G5413]]

### 47
Woe [[G3759]] to you! [[G4771]] You build [[G3618]] tombs [[G3419]] for the [[G3588]] prophets, [[G4396]] but [[G1161]] [it was] your [[G4771]] fathers [[G3962]] [who] killed [[G615]] them. [[G846]]

### 48
So [[G686]] you are [[G1510]] witnesses [who] [[G3144]] consent [[G4909]] to the [[G3588]] deeds [[G2041]] of [[G3588]] your [[G4771]] fathers: [[G3962]] They [[G846]] killed [[G615]] [the prophets], [[G846]] and [[G1161]] you [[G4771]] build [their tombs]. [[G3618]]

### 49
Because of this, [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] Wisdom [[G4678]] of God [[G2316]] said, [[G2036]] ‘I will send [[G649]] them [[G846]] prophets [[G4396]] and [[G2532]] apostles; [[G652]] [some] of [[G1537]] them [[G846]] they will kill [[G615]] and [others] [[G2532]] they will persecute.’ [[G1377]]

### 50
As a result, [[G2443]] this [[G3778]] generation [[G1074]] will be charged [[G1567]] with [[G575]] the [[G3588]] blood [[G129]] of all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] prophets [[G4396]] that [[G3588]] has been shed [[G1632]] since [[G575]] [the] foundation [[G2602]] of [the] world, [[G2889]]

### 51
from [[G575]] the blood [[G129]] of Abel [[G6]] to [[G2193]] the blood [[G129]] of Zechariah, [[G2197]] who [[G3588]] was killed [[G622]] between [[G3342]] the [[G3588]] altar [[G2379]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] sanctuary. [[G3624]] Yes, [[G3483]] I tell [[G3004]] you, [[G4771]] [ all of ] it will be charged [[G1567]] to [[G575]] this [[G3778]] generation. [[G1074]]

### 52
Woe [[G3759]] to you [[G4771]] experts in the law! [[G3544]] For [[G3754]] you have taken away [[G142]] the [[G3588]] key [[G2807]] to [[G3588]] knowledge. [[G1108]] You yourselves [[G846]] have not entered, [[G1525]] and [[G2532]] you have hindered [[G2967]] those who [[G3588]] were entering.” [[G1525]]

### 53
As [Jesus] [[G846]] went on [[G1831]] from there, [[G2547]] the [[G3588]] scribes [[G1122]] and [[G2532]] Pharisees [[G5330]] began [[G756]] to oppose [Him] bitterly [[G1758]] and [[G2532]] to ply Him with questions [[G653]] about [[G4012]] many things, [[G4119]]

### 54
waiting [[G1748]] to catch [[G2340]] Him [[G846]] in something [[G5100]] He might say. [[G1537]]
