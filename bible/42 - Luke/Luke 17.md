### 1
[Jesus] said [[G2036]] to [[G4314]] His [[G846]] disciples, [[G3101]] “It is [[G1510]] inevitable [[G418]] that [[G3588]] stumbling blocks [[G4625]] will come, [[G2064]] but [[G4133]] woe [ to the one ] [[G3759]] through [[G1223]] whom [[G3739]] they come! [[G2064]]

### 2
It would be better [[G3081]] for him [[G846]] to have [[G1487]] a millstone [[G3037]] hung [[G4029]] around [[G4012]] his [[G846]] neck [[G5137]] and [[G2532]] to be thrown [[G4496]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] sea [[G2281]] than [[G2228]] {to cause} [[G2443]] one [[G1520]] of these [[G3778]] little [ones] [[G3398]] to stumble. [[G4624]]

### 3
Watch [[G4337]] yourselves. [[G1438]] If [[G1437]] your [[G4771]] brother [[G80]] sins, [[G264]] rebuke [[G2008]] him; [[G846]] and [[G2532]] if [[G1437]] he repents, [[G3340]] forgive [[G863]] him. [[G846]]

### 4
Even [[G2532]] if [[G1437]] he sins [[G264]] against [[G1519]] you [[G4771]] seven times [[G2034]] in a [[G3588]] day, [[G2250]] and [[G2532]] seven times [[G2034]] returns [[G1994]] to say, [[G3004]] ‘I repent,’ [[G3340]] you must forgive [[G863]] him.” [[G846]]

### 5
The [[G3588]] apostles [[G652]] said [[G2036]] to the [[G3588]] Lord, [[G2962]] “Increase [[G4369]] our [[G1473]] faith!” [[G4102]]

### 6
And [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] answered, [[G2036]] “If [[G1487]] you have [[G2192]] faith [[G4102]] the size [[G5613]] of a mustard seed, [[G4615]] you can say [[G2036]] to this [[G3778]] mulberry tree, [[G4807]] ‘Be uprooted [[G1610]] and [[G2532]] planted [[G5452]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] sea,’ [[G2281]] and [[G2532]] it will obey [[G5219]] you. [[G4771]]

### 7
Which [[G5101]] of [[G1537]] you [[G4771]] [whose] [[G2192]] servant [[G1401]] comes in [[G1525]] from [[G1537]] plowing [[G722]] or [[G2228]] shepherding [[G4165]] in the [[G3588]] field [[G68]] will say [[G2046]] to him, [[G846]] ‘Come [[G3928]] at once [[G2112]] [and] sit down to eat’? [[G377]]

### 8
Instead, [[G235]] won’t he tell [[G2046]] him, [[G846]] ‘Prepare [[G2090]] my meal [[G1172]] and [[G2532]] dress yourself [[G4024]] to serve [[G1247]] me [[G1473]] while [[G2193]] I eat [[G5315]] and [[G2532]] drink; [[G4095]] and [[G2532]] afterward [[G3326]] you [[G4771]] may eat [[G5315]] and [[G2532]] drink’? [[G4095]]

### 9
Does he [[G2192]] thank [[G5485]] the [[G3588]] servant [[G1401]] because [[G3754]] he did [[G4160]] what [[G3588]] he was told? [[G1299]]

### 10
So [[G3779]] you [[G4771]] also, [[G2532]] when [[G3752]] you have done [[G4160]] everything [[G3956]] commanded [[G1299]] of you, [[G4771]] should say, [[G3004]] ‘We are [[G1510]] unworthy [[G888]] servants; [[G1401]] we have only done [[G4160]] our duty.’” [[G3784]]

### 11
While [[G2532]] [Jesus] was on His way [[G4198]] to [[G1519]] Jerusalem, [[G2419]] He [[G846]] was passing [[G1330]] between [[G3319]] Samaria [[G4540]] and [[G2532]] Galilee. [[G1056]]

### 12
As [[G2532]] He [[G846]] entered [[G1525]] one of [[G5100]] [the] villages, [[G2968]] He [[G846]] was met [[G528]] by ten [[G1176]] lepers. [[G3015]] [They] [[G3739]] stood [[G2476]] at a distance [[G4207]]

### 13
and [[G2532]] raised [[G142]] [their] voices, [[G5456]] shouting, [[G3004]] “Jesus, [[G2424]] Master, [[G1988]] have mercy on [[G1653]] us!” [[G1473]]

### 14
When [Jesus] saw [them], [[G3708]] He said, [[G2036]] “Go, [[G4198]] show [[G1925]] yourselves [[G1438]] to the [[G3588]] priests.” [[G2409]] And [[G2532]] as [[G1096]] they [[G846]] were on their way, [[G5217]] they were cleansed. [[G2511]]

### 15
When [[G1161]] one [[G1520]] of [[G1537]] them [[G846]] saw [[G3708]] that [[G3754]] he was healed, [[G2390]] he came back, [[G5290]] praising [[G1392]] God [[G2316]] in [[G3326]] a loud [[G3173]] voice. [[G5456]]

### 16
He fell [[G4098]] facedown [[G4383]] at [[G3844]] [Jesus’] [[G846]] feet [[G4228]] in thanksgiving [[G2168]] to Him— [[G846]] and [[G2532]] he [[G846]] was [[G1510]] a Samaritan. [[G4541]]

### 17
“{Were} not [[G3780]] [all] [[G3588]] ten [[G1176]] cleansed?” [[G2511]] Jesus [[G2424]] asked. [[G611]] “Where then are [[G4226]] the [other] [[G3588]] nine? [[G1767]]

### 18
Was no one found [[G2147]] except [[G1487]] this [[G3778]] foreigner [[G241]] to return [[G5290]] [and] give [[G1325]] glory [[G1391]] to God?” [[G2316]]

### 19
Then [[G2532]] [Jesus] said [[G2036]] to him, [[G846]] “Rise [[G450]] [and] go; [[G4198]] your [[G4771]] faith [[G4102]] has made you well!” [[G4982]]

### 20
When asked [[G1905]] by [[G5259]] the [[G3588]] Pharisees [[G5330]] when [[G4219]] the [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] of God [[G2316]] would come, [[G2064]] [Jesus] replied, [[G611]] “The [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] of God [[G2316]] {will} not [[G3756]] come [[G2064]] with [[G3326]] observable signs. [[G3907]]

### 21
Nor [[G3761]] will [people] say, [[G2046]] ‘Look, [[G2400]] here [it is],’ [[G5602]] or [[G2228]] ‘There [it is].’ [[G1563]] For [[G1063]] you see, [[G2400]] the [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] of God [[G2316]] is [[G1510]] in your [[G4771]] midst.” [[G1787]]

### 22
Then [[G1161]] He said [[G2036]] to [[G4314]] the [[G3588]] disciples, [[G3101]] “[The] time [[G2250]] is coming [[G2064]] when [[G3753]] you will long [[G1937]] to see [[G3708]] one [[G1520]] of the [[G3588]] days [[G2250]] of the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of Man, [[G444]] but [[G2532]] you will not see [it]. [[G3708]]

### 23
[People] will tell [[G2046]] you, [[G4771]] ‘Look, [[G2400]] there [He is],’ [[G1563]] or [[G2228]] ‘Here [He is].’ [[G5602]] {Do} not [[G3361]] go out [[G565]] [or] [[G3366]] chase after [them]. [[G1377]]

### 24
For [[G1063]] as [[G5618]] the [[G3588]] lightning [[G796]] flashes [[G797]] [and] lights up [[G2989]] the [[G3588]] sky [[G3772]] from [[G1537]] [one end] [[G3588]] to [[G1519]] the [other], [[G3588]] so [[G3779]] will be [[G1510]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of Man [[G444]] in [[G1722]] His [[G846]] day. [[G2250]]

### 25
But [[G1161]] first [[G4412]] He [[G846]] must [[G1163]] suffer [[G3958]] many things [[G4183]] and [[G2532]] be rejected [[G593]] by [[G575]] this [[G3778]] generation. [[G1074]]

### 26
Just [[G2532]] as [[G2531]] it was [[G1096]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] days [[G2250]] of Noah, [[G3575]] so [[G3779]] also [[G2532]] will it be [[G1510]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] days [[G2250]] of the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of [[G3588]] Man: [[G444]]

### 27
[People] were eating [[G2068]] [and] drinking, [[G4095]] marrying [[G1060]] [and] being given in marriage, [[G1061]] up to [[G891]] [the] [[G3739]] day [[G2250]] Noah [[G3575]] entered [[G1525]] the [[G3588]] ark. [[G2787]] Then [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] flood [[G2627]] came [[G2064]] and [[G2532]] destroyed [[G622]] them all. [[G3956]]

### 28
It was [[G1096]] the same [[G3668]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] days [[G2250]] of Lot: [[G3091]] [People] were eating [[G2068]] [and] drinking, [[G4095]] buying [[G59]] [and] selling, [[G4453]] planting [[G5452]] [and] building. [[G3618]]

### 29
But [[G1161]] on the [[G3739]] day [[G2250]] Lot [[G3091]] left [[G1831]] Sodom, [[G4670]] fire [[G4442]] and [[G2532]] brimstone [[G2303]] rained down [[G1026]] from [[G575]] heaven [[G3772]] and [[G2532]] destroyed [[G622]] them all. [[G3956]]

### 30
It will be [[G1510]] just like that [[G2596]] on the [[G3739]] day [[G2250]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of Man [[G444]] is revealed. [[G601]]

### 31
On [[G1722]] that [[G1565]] day, [[G2250]] {let} no one [[G3361]] on [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] housetop [[G1430]] come down [[G2597]] to [[G2532]] retrieve [[G142]] his [[G846]] possessions. [[G4632]] Likewise, [[G3668]] {let} no one [[G3361]] in [[G1722]] [the] field [[G68]] return [[G1994]] for [[G1519]] anything [[G3588]] [he has] left behind. [[G3694]]

### 32
Remember [[G3421]] Lot’s [[G3091]] wife! [[G1135]]

### 33
Whoever [[G3739]] tries [[G2212]] to save [[G4046]] his [[G846]] life [[G5590]] will lose [[G622]] it, [[G846]] but [[G1161]] whoever [[G3739]] loses [his life] [[G622]] will preserve [[G2225]] it. [[G846]]

### 34
I tell [[G3004]] you, [[G4771]] on that [[G3778]] night [[G3571]] two [people] [[G1417]] will be [[G1510]] in [[G1909]] one [[G1520]] bed: [[G2825]] One [[G1520]] will be taken [[G3880]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] other [[G2087]] left. [[G863]]

### 35
Two [women] [[G1417]] will be [[G1510]] grinding grain [[G229]] together: [[G846]] One [[G1520]] will be taken [[G3880]] and [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] other [[G2087]] left.” [[G863]]

### 36
Two [[G1417]] will be [[G1510]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] field; [[G68]] the [[G3588]] one [[G1520]] will be taken, [[G3880]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] other [[G2087]] will be left. [[G863]]

### 37
“Where, [[G4226]] Lord?” [[G2962]] they asked. [[G611]] [Jesus] answered, [[G2036]] “Wherever [there is] [[G3699]] a [[G3588]] carcass, [[G4983]] there [[G1563]] the [[G3588]] vultures [[G105]] will gather.” [[G1996]]
