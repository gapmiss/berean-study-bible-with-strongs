### 1
Then [[G1161]] Jesus, [[G2424]] full [[G4134]] of [the] Holy [[G40]] Spirit, [[G4151]] returned [[G5290]] from [[G575]] the [[G3588]] Jordan [[G2446]] and [[G2532]] was led [[G71]] by [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] Spirit [[G4151]] into [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] wilderness, [[G2048]]

### 2
[where for] forty [[G5062]] days [[G2250]] He was tempted [[G3985]] by [[G5259]] the [[G3588]] devil. [[G1228]] He ate [[G5315]] nothing [[G3762]] during [[G1722]] those [[G1565]] days, [[G2250]] and [[G2532]] [when] they [[G846]] had ended, [[G4931]] He was hungry. [[G3983]]

### 3
The [[G3588]] devil [[G1228]] said [[G2036]] to Him, [[G846]] “If [[G1487]] You are [[G1510]] [the] Son [[G5207]] of God, [[G2316]] tell [[G2036]] this [[G3778]] stone [[G3037]] to [[G2443]] become [[G1096]] bread.” [[G740]]

### 4
But [[G2532]] Jesus [[G2424]] answered, [[G611]] “It is written: [[G1125]] ‘Man [[G444]] shall not live [[G2198]] on [[G1909]] bread [[G740]] alone.’” [[G3441]]

### 5
Then [[G2532]] [the devil] led Him up to a high place [[G321]] [and] showed [[G1166]] Him [[G846]] in [[G1722]] an instant [[G4743]] all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] kingdoms [[G932]] of the [[G3588]] world. [[G3625]]

### 6
“I will give [[G1325]] You [[G4771]] authority [[G1849]] over all [[G537]] [these kingdoms] [[G3778]] and [all] [[G2532]] their [[G846]] glory,” [[G1391]] [he] [[G1228]] said. [[G2036]] “For [[G3754]] it has been relinquished [[G3860]] to me, [[G1473]] and [[G2532]] I can give [[G1325]] it [[G846]] to anyone [[G3739]] I wish. [[G2309]]

### 7
So [[G3767]] if [[G1437]] You [[G4771]] worship [[G4352]] me, [[G1473]] it will all be [[G1510]] Yours.” [[G4771]]

### 8
But [[G2532]] Jesus [[G2424]] replied, [[G611]] “It is written: [[G1125]] ‘Worship [[G4352]] [the] Lord [[G2962]] your [[G4771]] God [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] serve [[G3000]] Him [[G846]] only.’” [[G3441]]

### 9
Then [[G1161]] [the devil] led [[G71]] Him [[G846]] to [[G1519]] Jerusalem [[G2419]] and [[G2532]] set [Him] [[G2476]] on [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] pinnacle [[G4419]] of the [[G3588]] temple. [[G2411]] “If [[G1487]] You are [[G1510]] [the] Son [[G5207]] of God,” [[G2316]] he said, [[G2036]] “throw [[G906]] Yourself [[G4572]] down [[G2736]] from here. [[G1782]]

### 10
For [[G1063]] it is written: [[G1125]] ‘He will command [[G1781]] His [[G846]] angels [[G32]] concerning [[G4012]] You [[G4771]] to guard You carefully; [[G1314]]

### 11
and [[G2532]] they will lift [[G142]] You [up] [[G4771]] in [[G1909]] [their] hands, [[G5495]] so that {You will} not [[G3361]] strike [[G4350]] Your [[G4771]] foot [[G4228]] against [[G4314]] a stone.’” [[G3037]]

### 12
But [[G2532]] Jesus [[G2424]] declared, [[G611]] “It [also] says, [[G2046]] ‘Do not put [[G1598]] [the] Lord [[G2962]] your [[G4771]] God {to the test}.’” [[G2316]]

### 13
When [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] devil [[G1228]] had finished [[G4931]] every [[G3956]] temptation, [[G3986]] he left [[G868]] Him [[G846]] until [[G891]] an opportune time. [[G2540]]

### 14
Jesus [[G2424]] returned [[G5290]] to [[G1519]] Galilee [[G1056]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] power [[G1411]] of the [[G3588]] Spirit, [[G4151]] and [[G2532]] [the] news [[G5345]] about [[G4012]] Him [[G846]] spread [[G1831]] throughout [[G2596]] the [[G3588]] surrounding region. [[G4066]]

### 15
He [[G846]] taught [[G1321]] in [[G1722]] their [[G846]] synagogues [[G4864]] and was glorified [[G1392]] by [[G5259]] everyone. [[G3956]]

### 16
Then [[G2532]] [Jesus] came [[G2064]] to [[G1519]] Nazareth, [[G3478]] where [[G3757]] He had been [[G1510]] brought up. [[G5142]] As was [[G2596]] His [[G846]] custom, [[G1486]] He entered [[G1525]] the [[G3588]] synagogue [[G4864]] on [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] Sabbath. [[G4521]] And [when] [[G2532]] He stood up [[G450]] to read, [[G314]]

### 17
[the] scroll of [[G975]] the [[G3588]] prophet [[G4396]] Isaiah [[G2268]] was handed [[G1929]] to Him. [[G846]] Unrolling [[G380]] [it], [[G975]] He found [[G2147]] the [[G3588]] place [[G5117]] where [[G3739]] it was [[G1510]] written: [[G1125]]

### 18
“[The] Spirit [[G4151]] of [the] Lord [is] [[G2962]] on [[G1909]] Me, [[G1473]] because [[G1752]] He has anointed [[G5548]] Me [[G1473]] to preach good news [[G2097]] to [the] poor. [[G4434]] He has sent [[G649]] Me [[G1473]] to proclaim [[G2784]] deliverance [[G859]] to [the] captives [[G164]] and [[G2532]] recovery of sight [[G309]] to [the] blind, [[G5185]] to release [[G649]] [the] oppressed, [[G2352]]

### 19
to proclaim [[G2784]] [the] year [[G1763]] of [the] Lord’s [[G2962]] favor.” [[G1184]]

### 20
Then [[G2532]] He rolled up [[G4428]] the [[G3588]] scroll, [[G975]] returned [it] [[G591]] to the [[G3588]] attendant, [[G5257]] [and] sat down. [[G2523]] The [[G3588]] eyes [[G3788]] of everyone [[G3956]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] synagogue [[G4864]] were [[G1510]] fixed on [[G816]] Him, [[G846]]

### 21
and [[G1161]] He began [[G756]] by saying, [[G3004]] “Today [[G4594]] this [[G3778]] Scripture [[G1124]] is fulfilled [[G4137]] in [[G1722]] your [[G4771]] hearing.” [[G3775]]

### 22
All [[G3956]] spoke well [[G3140]] of Him [[G846]] and [[G2532]] marveled [[G2296]] at [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] gracious [[G5485]] words [[G3056]] that [[G3588]] came [[G1607]] from [[G1537]] His [[G846]] lips. [[G4750]] “Isn’t [[G1510]] this [[G3778]] the son [[G5207]] of Joseph?” [[G2501]] they asked. [[G2036]]

### 23
[Jesus] said [[G2036]] to [[G4314]] them, [[G846]] “Surely [[G3843]] you will quote [[G2046]] this [[G3778]] proverb [[G3850]] to Me: [[G1473]] ‘Physician, [[G2395]] heal [[G2323]] yourself! [[G4572]] Do [[G4160]] here [[G5602]] in [[G1722]] Your [[G4771]] hometown [[G3968]] what [[G3745]] we have heard [that] [[G191]] You did [[G1096]] in [[G1519]] Capernaum. [[G2584]]

### 24
Then [[G1161]] He added, [[G2036]] “Truly [[G281]] I tell [[G3004]] you, [[G4771]] no [[G3762]] prophet [[G4396]] is [[G1510]] accepted [[G1184]] in [[G1722]] his [[G846]] hometown. [[G3968]]

### 25
But [[G1161]] I tell [[G3004]] you [[G4771]] truthfully [that] [[G225]] there were [[G1510]] many [[G4183]] widows [[G5503]] in [[G1722]] Israel [[G2474]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] time [[G2250]] of Elijah, [[G2243]] when [[G3753]] the [[G3588]] sky [[G3772]] was shut [[G2808]] for [[G1909]] three [[G5140]] and [[G2532]] a half [[G1803]] years [[G2094]] [and] [[G5613]] great [[G3173]] famine [[G3042]] swept [[G1096]] over [[G1909]] all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] land. [[G1093]]

### 26
Yet [[G2532]] Elijah [[G2243]] was [not] sent [[G3992]] to [[G4314]] [any] [[G3762]] of them, [[G846]] but [[G1487]] to [[G4314]] [the] widow [[G5503]] of Zarephath [[G4558]] in Sidon. [[G4606]]

### 27
And [[G2532]] there were [[G1510]] many [[G4183]] lepers [[G3015]] in [[G1722]] Israel [[G2474]] in the time [[G1909]] of Elisha [[G1666]] the [[G3588]] prophet. [[G4396]] Yet [[G2532]] not one [[G3762]] of them [[G846]] was cleansed— [[G2511]] only [[G1487]] Naaman [[G3497]] the [[G3588]] Syrian.” [[G4948]]

### 28
On hearing [[G191]] [this], [[G3778]] all [the people] [[G3956]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] synagogue [[G4864]] were enraged. [[G4130]]

### 29
They got up, [[G450]] drove [[G1544]] Him [[G846]] out [[G1854]] of [[G3588]] [the] town, [[G4172]] and [[G2532]] led [[G71]] Him [[G846]] to [[G2193]] [the] brow [[G3790]] of the [[G3588]] hill [[G3735]] on [[G1909]] which [[G3739]] the [[G3588]] town [[G4172]] was built, [[G3618]] in order [[G5620]] to throw Him over the cliff. [[G2630]]

### 30
But [[G1161]] [Jesus] [[G846]] passed [[G1330]] through [[G1223]] [the crowd] [[G3319]] [and] went on His way. [[G4198]]

### 31
Then [[G2532]] He went down [[G2718]] to [[G1519]] Capernaum, [[G2584]] a town [[G4172]] in Galilee, [[G1056]] and [[G2532]] on [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] Sabbath [[G4521]] He began [[G1510]] to teach [[G1321]] [the people]. [[G846]]

### 32
They were astonished [[G1605]] at [[G1909]] His [[G846]] teaching, [[G1322]] because [[G3754]] His [[G846]] message [[G3056]] had [[G1510]] authority. [[G1849]]

### 33
In [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] synagogue [[G4864]] there was [[G1510]] a man [[G444]] possessed by [[G2192]] [the] spirit [[G4151]] of an unclean [[G169]] demon. [[G1140]] He cried out [[G349]] in a loud [[G3173]] voice, [[G5456]]

### 34
“Ha! [[G1436]] What [[G5101]] do You [want] [[G4771]] with us, [[G1473]] Jesus [[G2424]] of Nazareth? [[G3479]] Have You come [[G2064]] to destroy [[G622]] us? [[G1473]] I know [[G1492]] who [[G5101]] You [[G4771]] are, [[G1510]] the [[G3588]] Holy [One] [[G40]] of God!” [[G2316]]

### 35
[But] [[G2532]] Jesus [[G2424]] rebuked [[G2008]] [the demon]. [[G846]] “Be silent!” [[G5392]] He said. [[G3004]] “Come [[G1831]] out of [[G575]] him!” [[G846]] Then [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] demon [[G1140]] threw [the man] down [[G4496]] before [[G1519]] them all [[G3319]] [and] came out [[G1831]] without [[G3367]] harming [[G984]] him. [[G846]]

### 36
All [the people] [[G3956]] were overcome [[G1096]] with amazement [[G2285]] and [[G2532]] asked [[G4814]] one another, [[G240]] “What [[G5101]] [is] this [[G3778]] message? [[G3056]] With [[G1722]] authority [[G1849]] and [[G2532]] power [[G1411]] He commands [[G2004]] the [[G3588]] unclean [[G169]] spirits, [[G4151]] and [[G2532]] they come out!” [[G1831]]

### 37
And [[G2532]] the news [[G2279]] about [[G4012]] Him [[G846]] spread [[G1607]] throughout [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] surrounding region. [[G4066]]

### 38
[Jesus] left [[G450]] the [[G3588]] synagogue [[G4864]] [and] went [[G1525]] to [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] home [[G3614]] of Simon, [[G4613]] [whose] [[G4613]] mother-in-law [[G3994]] was [[G1510]] suffering from [[G4912]] a high [[G3173]] fever. [[G4446]] They appealed [[G2065]] to [Jesus] [[G846]] on [[G4012]] her [behalf], [[G846]]

### 39
and [[G2532]] He stood [[G2186]] over [[G1883]] her [[G846]] [and] rebuked [[G2008]] the [[G3588]] fever, [[G4446]] and [[G2532]] it left [[G863]] her. [[G846]] And [[G1161]] she got up [[G450]] at once [[G3916]] [and] began to serve [[G1247]] them. [[G846]]

### 40
At sunset, [[G1416]] all [[G537]] who were [[G2192]] ill [[G770]] with various [[G4164]] diseases [[G3554]] were brought [[G71]] to [[G4314]] [Jesus], [[G846]] and [[G1161]] laying [[G2007]] [His] [[G3588]] hands [[G5495]] on each [[G1538]] one, [[G1520]] He healed [[G2323]] them. [[G846]]

### 41
Demons [[G1140]] also [[G2532]] came out [[G1831]] of [[G575]] many [people], [[G4183]] shouting, [[G2905]] “You [[G4771]] are [[G1510]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of God!” [[G2316]] But [[G2532]] He rebuked [ the demons ] [[G2008]] [and] would not allow [[G1439]] them [[G846]] to speak, [[G2980]] because [[G3754]] they knew [[G1492]] He [[G846]] was [[G1510]] the [[G3588]] Christ. [[G5547]]

### 42
At daybreak, [[G2250]] [Jesus] went out [[G1831]] to [[G1519]] a solitary [[G2048]] place, [[G5117]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] crowds [[G3793]] were looking for [[G1934]] Him. [[G846]] They came [[G2064]] to [[G2193]] Him [[G846]] and [[G2532]] tried to keep [[G2722]] Him [[G846]] [from] [[G3361]] leaving. [[G4198]]

### 43
But [[G1161]] [Jesus] told [[G2036]] them, [[G846]] “I [[G1473]] must [[G1163]] preach [the] good news [[G2097]] of the [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] of God [[G2316]] to the [[G3588]] other [[G2087]] towns [[G4172]] as well, [[G2532]] because [[G3754]] that is why [[G3778]] I was sent.” [[G649]]

### 44
And [[G2532]] He continued [[G1510]] to preach [[G2784]] in [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] synagogues [[G4864]] of Judea. [[G2449]]
