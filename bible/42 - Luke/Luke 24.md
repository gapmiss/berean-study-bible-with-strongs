###### 1
On the [[G3588]] first [day] [[G1520]] of the [[G3588]] week, [[G4521]] very early [[G901]] in the morning, [[G3722]] [the women] came [[G2064]] to [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] tomb, [[G3418]] bringing [[G5342]] [the] spices [[G759]] they had prepared. [[G2090]]

###### 2
They found [[G2147]] the [[G3588]] stone [[G3037]] rolled away [[G617]] from [[G575]] the [[G3588]] tomb, [[G3419]]

###### 3
but [[G1161]] when they entered, [[G1525]] they did not find [[G2147]] the [[G3588]] body [[G4983]] of the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] Jesus. [[G2424]]

###### 4
While [[G1722]] they [[G846]] were puzzling [[G639]] over [[G4012]] this, [[G3778]] suddenly [[G2400]] two [[G1417]] men [[G435]] in [[G1722]] radiant [[G797]] apparel [[G2066]] stood beside [[G2186]] them. [[G846]]

###### 5
As [[G1161]] [the women] [[G846]] bowed [[G2827]] [their] [[G3588]] faces [[G4383]] to [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] ground [[G1093]] in terror, [[G1719]] [the two men] asked [[G2036]] them, [[G846]] “Why [[G5101]] do you look for [[G2212]] the [[G3588]] living [[G2198]] among [[G3326]] the [[G3588]] dead? [[G3498]]

###### 6
He is [[G1510]] not [[G3756]] here; [[G5602]] He has risen! [[G1453]] Remember [[G3403]] how [[G5613]] He told [[G2980]] you [[G4771]] while He was [[G1510]] still [[G2089]] in [[G1722]] Galilee: [[G1056]]

###### 7
‘The [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of Man [[G444]] must [[G1163]] be delivered [[G3860]] into [[G1519]] [the] hands [[G5495]] of sinful [[G268]] men, [[G444]] and [[G2532]] be crucified, [[G4717]] and [[G2532]] on the [[G3588]] third [[G5154]] day [[G2250]] rise again.’” [[G450]]

###### 8
Then [[G2532]] they remembered [[G3403]] His [[G846]] words. [[G4487]]

###### 9
And [[G2532]] when they returned [[G5290]] from [[G575]] the [[G3588]] tomb, [[G3419]] they reported [[G518]] all [[G3956]] these things [[G3778]] to the [[G3588]] eleven [[G1733]] and [[G2532]] to all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] others. [[G3062]]

###### 10
It was [[G1510]] Mary [[G3137]] Magdalene, [[G3094]] Joanna, [[G2489]] Mary [[G3137]] the [mother] [[G3588]] of James, [[G2385]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] other women [[G3062]] with [[G4862]] them [[G846]] [who] told [[G2036]] [this] [[G3778]] to [[G4314]] the [[G3588]] apostles. [[G652]]

###### 11
But [[G2532]] their [[G3778]] words [[G4487]] seemed [[G5316]] like [[G5616]] nonsense [[G3026]] to [[G1799]] them, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] they did not believe [[G569]] [the women]. [[G846]]

###### 12
Peter, [[G4074]] however, [[G1161]] got up [[G450]] [and] ran [[G5143]] to [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] tomb. [[G3419]] And [after] [[G2532]] bending down [[G3879]] [and] seeing [[G991]] only [[G3441]] the [[G3588]] linen cloths, [[G3608]] he went away [[G565]] wondering [[G2296]] to [[G4314]] himself [[G848]] what [[G3588]] had happened. [[G1096]]

###### 13
That [[G3588]] same [[G846]] day [[G2250]] two [[G1417]] of [[G1537]] them [[G846]] were [[G1510]] going [[G4198]] to [[G1519]] a village [[G2968]] called [[G3686]] Emmaus, [[G1695]] about seven miles [[G1835]] from [[G575]] Jerusalem. [[G2419]]

###### 14
They [[G846]] were talking [[G3656]] with [[G4314]] each other [[G240]] about [[G4012]] everything [[G3956]] that [[G3588]] had happened. [[G4819]]

###### 15
And [[G2532]] as [[G1096]] they [[G846]] talked [[G3656]] and [[G2532]] deliberated, [[G4802]] Jesus [[G2424]] Himself [[G846]] came up [[G1448]] [and] walked along [[G4848]] with them. [[G846]]

###### 16
But [[G1161]] their [[G846]] eyes [[G3788]] were kept [[G2902]] from recognizing [[G1921]] Him. [[G846]]

###### 17
He asked [[G2036]] them, [[G846]] “What [[G5101]] are you discussing so intently [[G474]] as you walk along?” [[G4043]] They stood still, [[G2476]] with sadness on their faces. [[G4659]]

###### 18
One [of them], [[G1520]] named [[G3686]] Cleopas, [[G2810]] asked [[G611]] Him, [[G846]] “{Are} You [[G4771]] the only [[G3441]] visitor [[G3939]] to Jerusalem [[G2419]] [who] [[G2532]] {does} not [[G3756]] know [[G1097]] the things [[G3588]] that have happened [[G1096]] [there] [[G846]] in [[G1722]] recent [[G3778]] days?” [[G2250]]

###### 19
“What things?” [[G4169]] He asked. [[G2036]] “The events [[G3588]] involving [[G4012]] Jesus [[G2424]] of [[G3588]] Nazareth,” [[G3479]] they answered. [[G2036]] “[This] man [[G435]] was [[G1096]] a prophet, [[G4396]] powerful [[G1415]] in [[G1722]] speech [[G3056]] and [[G2532]] action [[G2041]] before [[G1726]] God [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] people. [[G2992]]

###### 20
[Our] [[G3588]] chief priests [[G749]] and [[G2532]] rulers [[G758]] delivered Him up [[G3860]] to [[G1519]] [the] sentence [[G2917]] of death, [[G2288]] and [[G2532]] they crucified [[G4717]] Him. [[G846]]

###### 21
But [[G1161]] we [[G1473]] were hoping [[G1679]] He [[G846]] was [[G1510]] the [One who] [[G3588]] would [[G3195]] redeem [[G3084]] Israel. [[G2474]] And [[G2532]] besides [[G1065]] all [[G3956]] [this], [[G3778]] [it] [[G3778]] is [[G71]] [the] third [[G5154]] day [[G2250]] since [[G575]] these things [[G3778]] took place. [[G1096]]

###### 22
Furthermore, [[G235]] some [[G5100]] of [[G1537]] our [[G1473]] women [[G1135]] amazed [[G1839]] us. [[G1473]] They were [[G1096]] at [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] tomb [[G3419]] early this morning, [[G3720]]

###### 23
but [[G2532]] they did not find [[G2147]] His [[G846]] body. [[G4983]] They came [[G2064]] [and] told [us] [[G3004]] they had seen [[G3708]] a vision [[G3701]] of angels [[G32]] who [[G3739]] said that [[G3004]] [Jesus] [[G846]] was alive. [[G2198]]

###### 24
Then [[G2532]] some [[G5100]] of our companions [[G3588]] went [[G565]] to [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] tomb [[G3419]] and [[G2532]] found [it] [[G2147]] just [[G3779]] as [[G2531]] the [[G3588]] women [[G1135]] had described. [[G2036]] But [[G1161]] Him [[G846]] they did not see.” [[G3708]]

###### 25
Then [[G2532]] [Jesus] [[G846]] said [[G2036]] to [[G4314]] them, [[G846]] “O [[G5599]] foolish [ones], [[G453]] [how] slow [[G1021]] are your hearts [[G2588]] to believe [[G4100]] all [[G3956]] that [[G3739]] the [[G3588]] prophets [[G4396]] have spoken. [[G2980]]

###### 26
Was it not necessary for [[G1163]] the [[G3588]] Christ [[G5547]] to suffer [[G3958]] these things [[G3778]] and then [[G2532]] to enter [[G1525]] His [[G846]] glory?” [[G1391]]

###### 27
And [[G2532]] beginning [[G756]] with [[G575]] Moses [[G3475]] and [[G2532]] all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] Prophets, [[G4396]] He explained [[G1329]] to them [[G846]] what [ was written ] [[G3588]] in [[G1722]] all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] Scriptures [[G1124]] about [[G4012]] Himself. [[G1438]]

###### 28
As [[G2532]] they approached [[G1448]] the [[G3588]] village [[G2968]] where [[G3757]] they were headed, [[G4198]] He [[G846]] seemed [[G4364]] to be going [[G4198]] farther. [[G4206]]

###### 29
But [[G2532]] they pleaded with Him, [[G3849]] “Stay [[G3306]] with [[G3326]] us, [[G1473]] for [[G3754]] it is [[G1510]] nearly [[G4314]] evening [[G2073]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] day [[G2250]] is almost over.” [[G2827]] So [[G2532]] He went in [[G1525]] to stay [[G3306]] with [[G4862]] them. [[G846]]

###### 30
While [[G2532]] He [[G846]] was reclining [at the table] [[G2625]] with [[G3326]] them, [[G846]] He took [[G2983]] bread, [[G740]] spoke a blessing [[G2127]] and [[G2532]] broke [it], [[G2806]] [and] gave [it] [[G1929]] to them. [[G846]]

###### 31
Then [[G1161]] their [[G846]] eyes [[G3788]] were opened [[G1272]] and [[G2532]] they recognized [[G1921]] [Jesus]— [[G846]] and [[G2532]] He [[G846]] disappeared [[G855]] from [[G575]] [their sight]. [[G846]]

###### 32
They asked [[G2036]] one another, [[G240]] “Were [[G1510]] not [[G3780]] our [[G1473]] hearts [[G2588]] burning [[G2545]] within [[G1722]] us [[G1473]] as [[G5613]] He spoke [[G2980]] with us [[G1473]] on [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] road [[G3598]] [and] [[G5613]] opened [[G1272]] the [[G3588]] Scriptures [[G1124]] to us?” [[G1473]]

###### 33
And [[G2532]] they got up [[G450]] [that] very [[G846]] hour [[G5610]] [and] returned [[G5290]] to [[G1519]] Jerusalem. [[G2419]] [There] [[G2532]] they found [[G2147]] the [[G3588]] Eleven [[G1733]] and [[G2532]] those [[G3588]] with [[G4862]] them, [[G846]] gathered together [[G4867]]

###### 34
[and] saying, [[G3004]] “The [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] has indeed risen, [[G1453]] and [[G2532]] He has appeared [[G3708]] to Simon!” [[G4613]]

###### 35
Then [[G2532]] [the two] [[G846]] told [[G1834]] what had happened [[G3588]] on [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] road, [[G3598]] and [[G2532]] how [[G5613]] they [[G846]] had recognized [Jesus] [[G1097]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] breaking [[G2800]] of the [[G3588]] bread. [[G740]]

###### 36
While [[G1161]] they [[G846]] were describing [[G2980]] these [events], [[G3778]] [Jesus] Himself [[G846]] stood [[G2476]] among [[G3319]] them [[G846]] and [[G2532]] said, [[G3004]] “Peace [be] [[G1515]] with you.” [[G4771]]

###### 37
But [[G1161]] they were startled [[G4422]] and [[G2532]] frightened, [[G1719]] thinking [[G1380]] they had seen [[G2334]] a spirit. [[G4151]]

###### 38
“Why [[G5101]] are you [[G1510]] troubled,” [[G5015]] [Jesus] asked, [[G2036]] “and [[G2532]] why [[G1223]] {do} doubts [[G1261]] arise [[G305]] in [[G1722]] your [[G4771]] hearts? [[G2588]]

###### 39
Look at [[G3708]] My [[G1473]] hands [[G5495]] and [[G2532]] My [[G1473]] feet. [[G4228]] It is [[G1510]] I [[G1473]] Myself. [[G846]] Touch [[G5584]] Me [[G1473]] and [[G2532]] see— [[G3708]] for [[G3754]] a spirit [[G4151]] {does} not [[G3756]] have [[G2192]] flesh [[G4561]] and [[G2532]] bones, [[G3747]] as [[G2531]] you see [[G2334]] I [[G1473]] have. [[G2192]]

###### 40
And [when] [[G2532]] He had said [[G2036]] this, [[G3778]] He showed [[G1166]] them [[G846]] [His] [[G3588]] hands [[G5495]] and [[G2532]] feet. [[G4228]]

###### 41
While [[G1161]] they [[G846]] were still in disbelief [[G569]] because of [[G575]] [their] [[G3588]] joy [[G5479]] and [[G2532]] amazement, [[G2296]] He asked [[G2036]] them, [[G846]] “Do you have [[G2192]] anything [[G5100]] here [[G1759]] to eat?” [[G1034]]

###### 42
So [[G1161]] they gave [[G1929]] Him [[G846]] a piece [[G3313]] of broiled [[G3702]] fish, [[G2486]]

###### 43
and [[G2532]] He took [it] [[G2983]] [and] ate [it] [[G5315]] in front of [[G1799]] them. [[G846]]

###### 44
[Jesus] said [[G2036]] to [[G4314]] them, [[G846]] “These [are] [[G3778]] the [[G3588]] words [[G3056]] I spoke [[G2980]] to [[G4314]] you [[G4771]] while I was [[G1510]] still [[G2089]] with [[G4862]] you: [[G4771]] Everything [[G3956]] must [[G1163]] be fulfilled [[G4137]] that [is] [[G3588]] written [[G1125]] about [[G4012]] Me [[G1473]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] Law [[G3551]] of Moses, [[G3475]] the [[G3588]] Prophets, [[G4396]] and [[G2532]] [the] Psalms. [[G5568]]

###### 45
Then [[G5119]] He opened [[G1272]] their [[G846]] minds [[G3563]] to understand [[G4920]] the [[G3588]] Scriptures. [[G1124]]

###### 46
And [[G2532]] He told [[G2036]] them, [[G846]] “This [is] [[G3779]] [what] is written: [[G1125]] The [[G3588]] Christ [[G5547]] will suffer [[G3958]] and [[G2532]] rise [[G450]] from [[G1537]] [the] dead [[G3498]] [on] the [[G3588]] third [[G5154]] day, [[G2250]]

###### 47
and [[G2532]] in [[G1909]] His [[G846]] name [[G3686]] repentance [[G3341]] and [[G1519]] forgiveness [[G859]] of sins [[G266]] will be proclaimed [[G2784]] to [[G1519]] all [[G3956]] nations, [[G1484]] beginning [[G756]] in [[G575]] Jerusalem. [[G2419]]

###### 48
You [[G4771]] are [[G1510]] witnesses [[G3144]] of these things. [[G3778]]

###### 49
And [[G2532]] behold, [[G2400]] I [[G1473]] am sending [[G649]] the [[G3588]] promise [[G1860]] of [[G3588]] My [[G1473]] Father [[G3962]] upon [[G1909]] you. [[G4771]] But [[G1161]] remain [[G2523]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] city [[G4172]] until [[G2193]] you have been clothed with [[G1746]] power [[G1411]] from [[G1537]] on high.” [[G5311]]

###### 50
[When] [[G1161]] [Jesus] had led [[G1806]] them [[G846]] out [[G1854]] as far as [[G2193]] Bethany, [[G963]] He lifted up [[G1869]] His [[G846]] hands [[G5495]] [and] blessed [[G2127]] them. [[G846]]

###### 51
While [[G2532]] He [[G846]] was blessing [[G2127]] them, [[G846]] He left [[G1339]] them [[G846]] and [[G2532]] was carried up [[G399]] into [[G1519]] heaven. [[G3772]]

###### 52
And [[G2532]] they [[G846]] worshiped [[G4352]] Him [[G846]] [and] returned [[G5290]] to [[G1519]] Jerusalem [[G2419]] with [[G3326]] great [[G3173]] joy, [[G5479]]

###### 53
praising [[G2127]] God [[G2316]] continually [[G1223]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] temple. [[G2411]]
