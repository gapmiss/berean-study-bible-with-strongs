###### 1
One Sabbath, [[G4521]] [Jesus] [[G846]] went [[G2064]] to eat [[G5315]] in [[G1519]] [the] home [[G3624]] of a [[G5100]] leading [[G758]] Pharisee, [[G5330]] and [[G2532]] [those in attendance] [[G846]] were [[G1510]] watching Him closely. [[G3906]]

###### 2
Right there [[G2400]] in front [[G1715]] of Him [[G846]] was [[G1510]] a [[G5100]] man [[G444]] with dropsy. [[G5203]]

###### 3
So [[G2532]] Jesus [[G2424]] asked [[G611]] the [[G3588]] experts in the law [[G3544]] and [[G2532]] [the] Pharisees, [[G5330]] “Is it lawful [[G1832]] to heal [[G2323]] on the [[G3588]] Sabbath [[G4521]] or [[G2228]] not?” [[G3756]]

###### 4
But [[G1161]] they remained silent. [[G2270]] Then [[G2532]] [Jesus] took hold [of the man], [[G1949]] healed [[G2390]] him, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] sent him on his way. [[G630]]

###### 5
And [[G2532]] He asked [[G2036]] them, [[G846]] “Which [[G5101]] of you [[G4771]] [whose] son [[G5207]] or [[G2228]] ox [[G1016]] falls [[G4098]] into [[G1519]] a pit [[G5421]] on [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] Sabbath [[G4521]] day [[G2250]] {will} not [[G3756]] immediately [[G2112]] pull him out?” [[G385]]

###### 6
And [[G2532]] they were unable [[G2480]] to answer [[G470]] these [ questions ]. [[G3778]]

###### 7
When [Jesus] noticed [[G1907]] how [[G4459]] the [[G3588]] guests [[G2564]] chose [[G1586]] the [[G3588]] places of honor, [[G4411]] He told [[G2036]] them [[G846]] a parable: [[G3850]]

###### 8
“When [[G3752]] you are invited [[G2564]] to [[G1519]] a wedding banquet, [[G1062]] {do} not [[G3361]] sit [[G2625]] in [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] place of honor, [[G4411]] in case [[G3361]] [someone] more distinguished [[G1784]] than you [[G4771]] has been [[G1510]] invited. [[G2564]]

###### 9
Then [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] host who invited [[G2564]] both of you [[G4771]] will come [[G2064]] [and] tell [[G2046]] you, [[G4771]] ‘Give [[G1325]] this man [[G3778]] [your] seat.’ [[G5117]] And [[G2532]] in [[G3326]] humiliation, [[G152]] you will have [[G756]] to take [[G2722]] the [[G3588]] last [[G2078]] place. [[G5117]]

###### 10
But [[G235]] when [[G3752]] you are invited, [[G2564]] go [[G4198]] [and] sit [[G377]] in [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] last [[G2078]] place, [[G5117]] so that [[G2443]] your host [[G2564]] will come [[G2064]] [and] tell [[G2046]] you, [[G4771]] ‘Friend, [[G5384]] move up [[G4320]] to a better place.’ [[G511]] Then [[G5119]] you [[G4771]] will be [[G1510]] honored [[G1391]] in front of [[G1799]] everyone [[G3956]] at the table [[G4873]] [with] you. [[G4771]]

###### 11
For [[G3754]] everyone [[G3956]] who [[G3588]] exalts [[G5312]] himself [[G1438]] will be humbled, [[G5013]] and [[G2532]] the [one who] [[G3588]] humbles [[G5013]] himself [[G1438]] will be exalted.” [[G5312]]

###### 12
Then [[G1161]] [Jesus] said [[G2036]] to the [man who] [[G3588]] had invited [[G2564]] Him, [[G846]] “When [[G3752]] you host [[G4160]] a dinner [[G712]] or [[G2228]] a banquet, [[G1173]] {do} not [[G3361]] invite [[G5455]] your [[G4771]] friends [[G5384]] [or] [[G3366]] brothers [[G80]] [or] [[G3366]] relatives [[G4773]] [or] [[G3366]] rich [[G4145]] neighbors. [[G1069]] Otherwise, [[G3361]] they [[G846]] may invite [[G479]] you {in return}, [[G4771]] and [[G2532]] you [[G4771]] will be [[G1096]] repaid. [[G468]]

###### 13
But [[G235]] when [[G3752]] you host [[G4160]] a banquet, [[G1403]] invite [[G2564]] the poor, [[G4434]] the crippled, [[G376]] the lame, [[G5560]] [and] the blind, [[G5185]]

###### 14
and [[G2532]] you will be [[G1510]] blessed. [[G3107]] Since [[G3754]] they cannot [[G2192]] repay [[G467]] you, [[G4771]] you [[G4771]] will be repaid [[G467]] at [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] resurrection [[G386]] of the [[G3588]] righteous.” [[G1342]]

###### 15
When [[G1161]] one [[G5100]] of those [[G3588]] reclining with [Him] [[G4873]] heard [[G191]] [this], [[G3778]] he said [[G2036]] to [Jesus], [[G846]] “Blessed [is everyone] [[G3107]] who [[G3748]] will eat at the feast [[G5315]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] of God.” [[G2316]]

###### 16
But [[G1161]] [Jesus] replied, [[G2036]] “A certain [[G5100]] man [[G444]] prepared [[G4160]] a great [[G3173]] banquet [[G1173]] and [[G2532]] invited [[G2564]] many [guests]. [[G4183]]

###### 17
[When it was] [[G3588]] time [[G5610]] for the [[G3588]] banquet, [[G1173]] he sent [[G649]] his [[G846]] servant [[G1401]] to tell [[G2036]] those [[G3588]] who had been invited, [[G2564]] ‘Come, [[G2064]] for [[G3754]] [everything] is [[G1510]] now [[G2235]] ready.’ [[G2092]]

###### 18
But [[G2532]] one after another, [[G1520]] they all [[G3956]] began [[G756]] to make excuses. [[G3868]] The [[G3588]] first [one] [[G4413]] said, [[G2036]] ‘I have bought [[G59]] a field [[G68]] and [[G2532]] I [[G2192]] need [[G318]] to go [[G1831]] see [[G3708]] it. [[G846]] Please [[G2065]] excuse [[G3868]] me.’ [[G1473]]

###### 19
Another [[G2087]] said, [[G2036]] ‘I have bought [[G59]] five [[G4002]] yoke [[G2201]] of oxen [[G1016]] and [[G2532]] I am going [[G4198]] to try [[G1381]] them [out]. [[G846]] Please [[G2065]] excuse [[G3868]] me.’ [[G1473]]

###### 20
Still [[G2532]] another [[G2087]] said, [[G2036]] ‘I have married [[G1060]] a wife, [[G1135]] so [[G1223]] I cannot [[G1410]] come.’ [[G2064]]

###### 21
The [[G3588]] servant [[G1401]] returned [[G3854]] [and] reported [[G518]] all this [[G3778]] to [[G3588]] his [[G846]] master. [[G2962]] Then [[G5119]] the [[G3588]] owner of the house [[G3617]] became angry [[G3710]] [and] said [[G2036]] to [[G3588]] his [[G846]] servant, [[G1401]] ‘Go out [[G1831]] quickly [[G5030]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] streets [[G4113]] and [[G2532]] alleys [[G4505]] of the [[G3588]] city, [[G4172]] and [[G2532]] bring in [[G1521]] the [[G3588]] poor, [[G4434]] [the] crippled, [[G376]] [the] blind, [[G5185]] and [[G2532]] [the] lame. [[G5560]]

###### 22
‘Sir,’ [[G2962]] the [[G3588]] servant [[G1401]] replied, [[G2036]] ‘what [[G3739]] you ordered [[G2004]] has been done, [[G1096]] and [[G2532]] there is [[G1510]] still [[G2089]] room.’ [[G5117]]

###### 23
[So] [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] master [[G2962]] told [[G2036]] [his] [[G3588]] servant, [[G1401]] ‘Go out [[G1831]] to [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] highways [[G3598]] and [[G2532]] [the] hedges [[G5418]] and [[G2532]] compel [them] [[G315]] to come in, [[G1525]] so that [[G2443]] my [[G1473]] house [[G3624]] will be full. [[G1072]]

###### 24
For [[G1063]] I tell [[G3004]] you, [[G4771]] not one [[G3762]] of those [[G1565]] men [[G435]] who [[G3588]] were invited [[G2564]] will taste [[G1089]] my [[G1473]] banquet.’” [[G1173]]

###### 25
Large [[G4183]] crowds [[G3793]] were now traveling with [[G4848]] [Jesus], [[G846]] and [[G2532]] He turned [[G4762]] [and] said [[G2036]] to [[G4314]] them, [[G846]]

###### 26
“If [[G1487]] anyone [[G5100]] comes [[G2064]] to [[G4314]] Me [[G1473]] and [[G2532]] {does} not [[G3756]] hate [[G3404]] his [[G1438]] father [[G3962]] and [[G2532]] mother [[G3384]] and [[G2532]] wife [[G1135]] and [[G2532]] children [[G5043]] and [[G2532]] brothers [[G80]] and [[G2532]] sisters— [[G79]] yes, [[G2089]] even [[G2532]] his [[G1438]] [own] [[G3588]] life— [[G5590]] he cannot [[G1410]] be [[G1510]] My [[G1473]] disciple. [[G3101]]

###### 27
[And] whoever [[G3748]] {does} not [[G3756]] carry [[G941]] his [[G1438]] cross [[G4716]] and [[G2532]] follow [[G2064]] Me [[G1473]] cannot [[G1410]] be [[G1510]] My [[G1473]] disciple. [[G3101]]

###### 28
Which [[G5101]] of [[G1537]] you, [[G4771]] wishing [[G2309]] to build [[G3618]] a tower, [[G4444]] {does} not [[G3780]] first [[G4412]] sit down [[G2523]] [and] count [[G5585]] the [[G3588]] cost [[G1160]] to see if [[G1487]] he has [ the resources ] [[G2192]] to [[G1519]] complete [it]? [[G535]]

###### 29
Otherwise, [[G2443]] if he lays [[G5087]] [the] [[G846]] foundation [[G2310]] and [[G2532]] is unable [[G2480]] to finish [the work], [[G1615]] everyone [[G3956]] who [[G3588]] sees [it] [[G2334]] will ridicule [[G1702]] him, [[G846]]

###### 30
saying, [[G3004]] ‘This [[G3778]] man [[G444]] could [[G2480]] not [[G3756]] finish [[G1615]] what he started [[G756]] to build.’ [[G3618]]

###### 31
Or [[G2228]] what [[G5101]] king [[G935]] on his way [[G4198]] to war [[G4171]] with another [[G2087]] king [[G935]] will not first sit down [[G2523]] [and] consider [[G1011]] whether [[G1487]] he [[G1510]] can [[G1415]] engage [[G5221]] with [[G1722]] ten [[G1176]] thousand [men] [[G5505]] the [one] [[G3588]] coming [[G2064]] against [[G1909]] him [[G846]] with [[G3326]] twenty [[G1501]] thousand? [[G5505]]

###### 32
And [[G1161]] if [[G1487]] [he is unable], [[G1490]] he will send [[G649]] a delegation [[G4242]] [while the other king] [[G846]] is [[G1510]] still [[G2089]] far off, [[G4206]] to ask [[G2065]] for [[G4314]] terms of peace. [[G1515]]

###### 33
In the same way, [[G3779]] any one [[G3956]] of [[G1537]] you [[G4771]] who [[G3739]] does not give up [[G657]] everything [[G3956]] he [[G1438]] has [[G5225]] cannot [[G1410]] be [[G1510]] My [[G1473]] disciple. [[G3101]]

###### 34
Salt [[G217]] [is] good, [[G2570]] but [[G1161]] if [[G1437]] the [[G3588]] salt [[G217]] loses its savor, [[G3471]] with [[G1722]] what [[G5101]] will it be seasoned? [[G741]]

###### 35
It is [[G1510]] fit [[G2111]] neither [[G3777]] for [[G1519]] [the] soil [[G1093]] nor [[G3777]] for [[G1519]] [the] manure pile, [[G2874]] [and] it [[G846]] is thrown [[G906]] out. [[G1854]] He who [[G3588]] has [[G2192]] ears [[G3775]] to hear, [[G191]] let him hear.” [[G191]]
