### 1
Now [[G1161]] there were [[G1096]] also [[G2532]] false prophets [[G5578]] among [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] people, [[G2992]] just [[G2532]] as [[G5613]] there will be [[G1510]] false teachers [[G5572]] among [[G1722]] you. [[G4771]] [They] [[G3748]] will secretly introduce [[G3919]] destructive [[G684]] heresies [[G139]] [that] even [[G2532]] deny [[G720]] the [[G3588]] Master [[G1203]] who bought [[G59]] them, [[G846]] bringing [[G1863]] swift [[G5031]] destruction [[G684]] on themselves. [[G1438]]

### 2
Many [[G4183]] will follow in [[G1811]] their [[G846]] depravity, [[G766]] [and] because of [[G1223]] [them] [[G3739]] the [[G3588]] way [[G3598]] of [[G3588]] truth [[G225]] will be defamed. [[G987]]

### 3
In [[G1722]] their greed, [[G4124]] [these false teachers] will exploit [[G1710]] you [[G4771]] with tales [[G3056]] they have concocted. [[G4112]] The [[G3588]] longstanding [[G1597]] verdict [[G2917]] against them [[G3739]] remains in force, [[G691]] and [[G2532]] their [[G846]] destruction [[G684]] {does} not [[G3756]] sleep. [[G3573]]

### 4
For [[G1063]] if [[G1487]] God [[G2316]] {did} not [[G3756]] spare [[G5339]] [the] angels [[G32]] when they sinned, [[G264]] but [[G235]] cast [them] into hell, [[G5020]] delivering [them] [[G3860]] in chains [[G4577]] to be held [[G5083]] in gloomy darkness [[G2217]] until [their] [[G1519]] judgment; [[G2920]]

### 5
[if] [[G2532]] He did not spare [[G5339]] [the] ancient [[G744]] world [[G2889]] when He brought [[G1863]] [the] flood [[G2627]] [on its] [[G2889]] ungodly [people], [[G765]] but [[G235]] preserved [[G5442]] Noah, [[G3575]] a preacher [[G2783]] of righteousness, [[G1343]] among the eight; [[G3590]]

### 6
[if] [[G2532]] He condemned [[G2632]] [the] cities [[G4172]] of Sodom [[G4670]] and [[G2532]] Gomorrah [[G1116]] to destruction, [[G2692]] reducing [them] to ashes [[G5077]] [as] [[G5087]] an example [[G5262]] of what is coming on [[G3195]] the ungodly; [[G765]]

### 7
and [[G2532]] [if] He rescued [[G4506]] Lot, [[G3091]] a righteous [man] [[G1342]] distressed [[G2669]] by [[G5259]] the [[G3588]] depraved [[G766]] conduct [[G391]] of the [[G3588]] lawless [[G113]]

### 8
(for [[G1063]] that [[G3588]] righteous [man], [[G1342]] living [[G1460]] among [[G1722]] them [[G846]] day [[G2250]] after [[G1537]] day, [[G2250]] was tormented [[G928]] [in his] righteous [[G1342]] soul [[G5590]] [by the] lawless [[G459]] deeds [[G2041]] he saw [[G990]] and [[G2532]] heard)— [[G189]]

### 9
[ if all this is so, then the ] Lord [[G2962]] knows how [[G1492]] to rescue [[G4506]] [the] godly [[G2152]] from [[G1537]] trials [[G3986]] and [[G1161]] to hold [[G5083]] [the] unrighteous [[G94]] for punishment [[G2849]] on [[G1519]] [the] day [[G2250]] of judgment. [[G2920]]

### 10
[ Such punishment is ] [[G1161]] specially [reserved] [[G3122]] for those who [[G3588]] indulge [[G4198]] [the] corrupt [[G3394]] desires [[G1939]] of [[G3694]] [the] flesh [[G4561]] and [[G2532]] despise [[G2706]] authority. [[G2963]] Bold [[G5113]] [and] self-willed, [[G829]] [these men] are unafraid [[G5141]] to slander [[G987]] angelic majesties. [[G1391]]

### 11
Yet not even [[G3699]] angels, [[G32]] [though] [[G1510]] greater [[G3173]] in strength [[G2479]] and [[G2532]] power, [[G1411]] dare to bring [[G5342]] such slanderous [[G989]] charges [[G2920]] against [[G2596]] them [[G846]] before [[G3844]] [the] Lord. [[G2962]]

### 12
These [men] [[G3778]] [are] like [[G5613]] irrational [[G249]] animals, [[G2226]] creatures of instinct, [[G5446]] born [[G1080]] to be captured [[G259]] and [[G2532]] destroyed. [[G5356]] They blaspheme [[G987]] in [[G1722]] [matters] [[G3739]] they do not understand, [[G50]] [and like] [[G1722]] [such creatures], [[G5356]] they too will be destroyed. [[G5351]]

### 13
The harm they will suffer [[G91]] [is the] wages [[G3408]] of [their] wickedness. [[G93]] They consider it [[G2233]] a pleasure [[G2237]] to carouse [[G5172]] in [[G1722]] broad daylight. [[G2250]] [They are] blots [[G4696]] and [[G2532]] blemishes, [[G3470]] reveling [[G1792]] in [[G1722]] their [[G846]] deception [[G539]] as they feast with [[G4910]] you. [[G4771]]

### 14
[Their] eyes [[G3788]] are [[G2192]] full [[G3324]] of adultery; [[G3428]] their desire for sin is never satisfied; [[G180]] they seduce [[G1185]] [the] unstable. [[G793]] [They are] accursed [[G2671]] children [[G5043]] with [[G2192]] hearts [[G2588]] trained [[G1128]] in greed. [[G4124]]

### 15
They have left [[G2641]] [the] straight [[G2117]] way [[G3598]] and wandered off [[G4105]] to follow [[G1811]] the [[G3588]] way [[G3598]] of Balaam [[G903]] [son] of Beor, [[G1007]] who [[G3739]] loved [[G25]] [the] wages [[G3408]] of wickedness. [[G93]]

### 16
But [[G1161]] he was [[G2192]] rebuked [[G1649]] for his [[G2398]] transgression [[G3892]] by a donkey, [[G5268]] [ otherwise ] without speech, [[G880]] that spoke [[G5350]] with [[G1722]] a man’s [[G444]] voice [[G5456]] [and] restrained [[G2967]] the [[G3588]] prophet’s [[G4396]] madness. [[G3913]]

### 17
These [men] [[G3778]] are [[G1510]] springs [[G4077]] without water [[G504]] and [[G2532]] mists [[G887]] driven [[G1643]] by [[G5259]] a storm. [[G2978]] Blackest [[G2217]] darkness [[G4655]] is reserved [[G5083]] for them. [[G3739]]

### 18
With lofty [[G5246]] [but] empty [[G3153]] words, they appeal [[G5350]] [to the] sensual [[G766]] passions [[G1939]] of [the] flesh [[G4561]] [and] entice [[G1185]] those [[G3588]] [who are] just [[G3641]] escaping [[G668]] from [others] who [[G3588]] live [[G390]] in [[G1722]] error. [[G4106]]

### 19
They promise [[G1861]] them [[G846]] freedom, [[G1657]] while they themselves [[G846]] are [[G5225]] slaves [[G1401]] to corruption. [[G5356]] For [[G1063]] a man is a slave [[G1402]] to whatever [[G3739]] has overcome him. [[G2274]]

### 20
If [[G1487]] indeed [[G1063]] they have escaped [[G668]] the [[G3588]] corruption [[G3393]] of the [[G3588]] world [[G2889]] through [[G1722]] [their] knowledge [[G1922]] of the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] and [[G2532]] Savior [[G4990]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ, [[G5547]] only [[G1161]] to be entangled [[G1707]] [and] overcome [[G2274]] by it [[G3778]] again, [[G3825]] their [[G846]] final [condition] [[G2078]] is [[G1096]] worse than [[G5501]] [it was] [[G3588]] at first. [[G4413]]

### 21
It would have been [[G1510]] better [[G2909]] for them [[G846]] not [[G3361]] to have known [[G1921]] the [[G3588]] way [[G3598]] of righteousness [[G1343]] than [[G2228]] to have known [it] [[G1921]] and turned away [[G5290]] from [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] holy [[G40]] commandment [[G1785]] passed on [[G3860]] to them. [[G846]]

### 22
Of them [[G846]] the [[G3588]] proverbs [[G3942]] are [[G4819]] true: [[G227]] “A dog [[G2965]] returns [[G1994]] to [[G1909]] [its] [[G2398]] vomit,” [[G1829]] and, [[G2532]] “A sow [[G5300]] that is washed [[G3068]] [goes back] to [her] [[G1519]] wallowing [[G2946]] in [the] mud.” [[G1004]]
