### 1
Beloved, [[G27]] this [is] [[G3778]] now [[G2235]] [my] second [[G1208]] letter [[G1992]] to you. [[G4771]] [Both] [[G1722]] of [them] [[G3739]] [are] reminders [[G5280]] to stir [[G1326]] you [[G4771]] to wholesome [[G1506]] thinking [[G1271]]

### 2
by recalling [[G3403]] what [[G3588]] was foretold [[G4302]] by [[G5259]] the [[G3588]] holy [[G40]] prophets [[G4396]] and [[G2532]] commanded [[G1785]] by [our] [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] and [[G2532]] Savior [[G4990]] through your [[G4771]] apostles. [[G652]]

### 3
First of all, [[G4412]] you must understand [[G1097]] that [[G3754]] in [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] last [[G2078]] days [[G2250]] scoffers [[G1703]] will come, [[G2064]] scoffing [[G1701]] [and] following [[G4198]] their [[G846]] own [[G2398]] evil desires. [[G1939]]

### 4
“Where [[G4226]] is [[G1510]] the [[G3588]] promise [[G1860]] of [[G3588]] His [[G846]] coming?” [[G3952]] they will ask. [[G3004]] “Ever [[G575]] since [[G3739]] [our] [[G3588]] fathers [[G3962]] fell asleep, [[G2837]] everything [[G3956]] continues [[G1265]] as it has [[G3779]] from [[G575]] [the] beginning [[G746]] of creation.” [[G2937]]

### 5
[But] [[G1063]] they [[G846]] deliberately [[G2309]] overlook [[G2990]] the fact that [[G3778]] long ago [[G1597]] by [[G3588]] God’s [[G2316]] word [[G3056]] [the] heavens [[G3772]] existed [[G1510]] and [[G2532]] [the] earth [[G1093]] was formed [[G4921]] out of [[G1537]] water [[G5204]] and [[G2532]] by [[G1223]] water, [[G5204]]

### 6
through [[G1223]] which [[G3739]] the [[G3588]] world [[G2889]] of that time [[G5119]] perished [[G622]] in the flood. [[G2626]]

### 7
And [[G1161]] by that [[G3588]] same [[G846]] word, [[G3056]] the present [[G3568]] heavens [[G3772]] and [[G2532]] earth [[G1093]] are [[G1510]] reserved [[G2343]] for fire, [[G4442]] kept [[G5083]] for [[G1519]] [the] day [[G2250]] of judgment [[G2920]] and [[G2532]] destruction [[G684]] of ungodly [[G765]] men. [[G444]]

### 8
Beloved, [[G27]] {do} not {let} [[G3361]] [this] one [[G1520]] thing [[G3778]] escape your notice: [[G2990]] With [[G3844]] [the] Lord [[G2962]] a [[G1520]] day [[G2250]] [is] like [[G5613]] a thousand [[G5507]] years, [[G2094]] and [[G2532]] a thousand [[G5507]] years [[G2094]] [are] like [[G5613]] a [[G1520]] day. [[G2250]]

### 9
The Lord [[G2962]] is not slow [to fulfill ] [[G1019]] [His] [[G3588]] promise [[G1860]] as [[G5613]] some [[G5100]] understand [[G2233]] slowness, [[G1022]] but [[G235]] is patient [[G3114]] with [[G1519]] you, [[G4771]] not [[G3361]] wanting [[G1014]] anyone [[G5100]] to perish [[G622]] but [[G235]] everyone [[G3956]] to come [[G5562]] to [[G1519]] repentance. [[G3341]]

### 10
But [[G1161]] [the] day [[G2250]] of [the] Lord [[G2962]] will come [[G2240]] like [[G5613]] a thief. [[G2812]] The [[G3588]] heavens [[G3772]] will disappear [[G3928]] with a roar, [[G4500]] [the] elements [[G4747]] will be dissolved [[G3089]] in the fire, [[G2741]] and [[G2532]] [the] earth [[G1093]] and [[G2532]] [its] [[G846]] works [[G2041]] will not be found. [[G2147]]

### 11
[Since] everything [[G3956]] will be dissolved [[G3089]] in this way, [[G3779]] what kind of [people] [[G4217]] ought [[G1163]] you [[G4771]] to be? [[G5225]] You ought to conduct yourselves [[G391]] in [[G1722]] holiness [[G40]] and [[G2532]] godliness [[G2150]]

### 12
as you anticipate [[G4328]] and [[G2532]] hasten [[G4692]] the [[G3588]] coming [[G3952]] of the [[G3588]] day [[G2250]] of God, [[G2316]] when [[G3739]] [the] heavens [[G3772]] will be dissolved [[G3089]] by fire [[G4448]] and [[G2532]] [the] elements [[G4747]] will melt [[G5080]] in the heat. [[G2741]]

### 13
But [[G1161]] in keeping with [[G2596]] [God’s] [[G846]] promise, [[G1862]] we are looking forward to [[G4328]] a new [[G2537]] heaven [[G3772]] and [[G2532]] a new [[G2537]] earth, [[G1093]] where [[G3739]] righteousness [[G1343]] dwells. [[G2730]]

### 14
Therefore, [[G1352]] beloved, [[G27]] as you anticipate [[G4328]] these things, [[G3778]] make every effort [[G4704]] to be found [[G2147]] at [[G1722]] peace [[G1515]] with Him, [[G846]] without spot [[G784]] [or] [[G2532]] blemish. [[G298]]

### 15
Consider also that [[G2233]] our [[G1473]] Lord’s [[G2962]] patience [[G3115]] [brings] salvation, [[G4991]] just as [[G2531]] our [[G1473]] beloved [[G27]] brother [[G80]] Paul [[G3972]] also [[G2532]] wrote [[G1125]] you [[G4771]] with [[G2596]] the [[G3588]] wisdom [[G4678]] [God] gave him. [[G1325]]

### 16
[ He writes ] this way [[G5613]] in [[G1722]] all [[G3956]] [his] [[G3588]] letters, [[G1992]] speaking [[G2980]] in [[G1722]] them [[G846]] about [[G4012]] [such matters]. [[G3778]] Some [parts] [[G5100]] of [[G1722]] [his letters] [[G3739]] are [[G1510]] hard to understand, [[G1425]] which [[G3739]] ignorant [[G261]] and [[G2532]] unstable [people] [[G793]] distort, [[G4761]] as [[G5613]] [they do] [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] rest of [[G3062]] [the] Scriptures, [[G1124]] to [[G4314]] their [[G846]] own [[G2398]] destruction. [[G684]]

### 17
Therefore, [[G3767]] beloved, [[G27]] [since] you [[G4771]] already know [these things], [[G4267]] be on your guard [[G5442]] so that [[G2443]] you will not [[G3361]] be carried away [[G4879]] by the [[G3588]] error [[G4106]] of the [[G3588]] lawless [[G113]] [and] fall from [[G1601]] [your] [[G3588]] secure standing. [[G4740]]

### 18
But [[G1161]] grow [[G837]] in [[G1722]] [the] grace [[G5485]] and [[G2532]] knowledge [[G1108]] of our [[G1473]] Lord [[G2962]] and [[G2532]] Savior [[G4990]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ. [[G5547]] To Him [be] [[G846]] the [[G3588]] glory [[G1391]] both [[G2532]] now [[G3568]] and [[G2532]] to [[G1519]] [the] day [[G2250]] of eternity. [[G165]] Amen. [[G281]]
