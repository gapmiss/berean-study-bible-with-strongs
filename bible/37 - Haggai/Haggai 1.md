###### 1
In the second [[H8147]] year [[H8141]] of the reign [[H4428]] of Darius, [[H1867]] on the first [[H259]] day [[H3117]] of the sixth [[H8345]] month, [[H2320]] the word [[H1697]] of the LORD [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] through [[H3027]] Haggai [[H2292]] the prophet [[H5030]] to [[H413]] Zerubbabel [[H2216]] son [[H1121]] of Shealtiel, [[H7597]] governor [[H6346]] of Judah, [[H3063]] and to [[H413]] Joshua [[H3091]] son [[H1121]] of Jehozadak, [[H3087]] the high [[H1419]] priest, [[H3548]] stating [[H559]]

###### 2
that this is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts [[H6635]] says: [[H559]] “These [[H2088]] people [[H5971]] say, [[H559]] ‘The time [[H6256]] has not yet [[H3808]] come [[H935]] to rebuild [[H1129]] the house [[H1004]] of the LORD.’” [[H3068]]

###### 3
Then the word [[H1697]] of the LORD [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] through [[H3027]] Haggai [[H2292]] the prophet, [[H5030]] saying: [[H559]]

###### 4
“Is it a time [[H6256]] for you  yourselves [[H859]] to live [[H3427]] in your paneled [[H5603]] houses, [[H1004]] while this [[H2088]] house [[H1004]] lies in ruins?” [[H2720]]

###### 5
Now [[H6258]] this is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts [[H6635]] says: [[H559]] “Think carefully [[H7760]] about [[H5921]] your ways. [[H1870]]

###### 6
You have planted [[H2232]] much [[H7235]] but harvested [[H935]] little. [[H4592]] You eat [[H398]] but never [[H369]] have enough. [[H7654]] You drink [[H8354]] but never [[H369]] have your fill. [[H7937]] You put on clothes [[H3847]] but never [[H369]] get warm. [[H2527]] You earn wages [[H7936]] to put into [[H413]] a bag [[H6872]] pierced through.” [[H5344]]

###### 7
This is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts [[H6635]] says: [[H559]] “Think carefully [[H7760]] about [[H5921]] your ways. [[H1870]]

###### 8
Go up [[H5927]] into the hills, [[H2022]] bring down [[H935]] lumber, [[H6086]] and build [[H1129]] the house, [[H1004]] so that I may take pleasure [[H7521]] in it  and be glorified, [[H3513]] says [[H559]] the LORD. [[H3068]]

###### 9
You expected [[H6437]] much, [[H7235]] but behold, [[H2009]] it amounted to little. [[H4592]] And what you brought [[H935]] home, [[H1004]] I blew away. [[H5301]] Why? [[H3282]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts. [[H6635]] Because [[H3282]] My house [[H1004]] still lies in ruins, [[H2720]] while each [[H376]] of you [[H859]] is busy [[H7323]] with his own house. [[H1004]]

###### 10
Therefore, [[H5921]] on account of you [[H5921]] the heavens [[H8064]] have withheld [[H3607]] their dew [[H2919]] and the earth [[H776]] has withheld [[H3607]] its crops. [[H2981]]

###### 11
I have summoned [[H7121]] a drought [[H2721]] on [[H5921]] the fields [[H776]] [and] on the mountains, [[H2022]] on [[H5921]] the grain, [[H1715]] new wine, [[H8492]] and [[H5921]] olive oil, [[H3323]] and on whatever [[H834]] the ground [[H127]] yields, [[H3318]] on [[H5921]] man [[H120]] and beast, [[H929]] and on [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] the labor [[H3018]] of [your] hands.” [[H3709]]

###### 12
Then Zerubbabel [[H2216]] son [[H1121]] of Shealtiel [[H7597]] and Joshua [[H3091]] son [[H1121]] of Jehozadak, [[H3087]] the high [[H1419]] priest, [[H3548]] as well as all [[H3605]] the remnant [[H7611]] of the people, [[H5971]] obeyed [[H8085]] the voice [[H6963]] of the LORD [[H3068]] their God [[H430]] and the words [[H1697]] of the prophet [[H5030]] Haggai, [[H2292]] because [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] their God [[H430]] had sent him. [[H7971]] So the people [[H5971]] feared [[H3372]] the LORD. [[H3068]]

###### 13
Haggai, [[H2292]] the messenger [[H4397]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] delivered [[H559]] the LORD’s [[H3068]] message [[H4400]] to the people, [[H5971]] saying: [[H559]] “I [am] [[H589]] with you,” [[H854]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD. [[H3068]]

###### 14
So the LORD [[H3068]] stirred [[H5782]] the spirit [[H7307]] of Zerubbabel [[H2216]] son [[H1121]] of Shealtiel, [[H7597]] governor [[H6346]] of Judah, [[H3063]] and [[H853]] the spirit [[H7307]] of Joshua [[H3091]] son [[H1121]] of Jehozadak, [[H3087]] the high [[H1419]] priest, [[H3548]] as well as [[H853]] the spirit [[H7307]] of all [[H3605]] the remnant [[H7611]] of the people. [[H5971]] And they came [[H935]] and [[H6213]] began the work [[H4399]] on the house [[H1004]] of the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts, [[H6635]] their God, [[H430]]

###### 15
on the twenty-fourth [[H6242]] day [[H3117]] of the sixth [[H8345]] month, [[H2320]] in the second [[H8147]] year [[H8141]] of King [[H4428]] Darius. [[H1867]]
