### 1
Now Elisha [[H477]] said [[H1696]] to [[H413]] the woman [[H802]] whose son [[H1121]] he had restored to life, [[H2421]] “Arise, [[H6965]] you [[H859]] and your household, [[H1004]] and go [[H1980]] and live as a foreigner [[H1481]] wherever [[H834]] you can. [[H1481]] For [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] has decreed [[H7121]] a seven-year [[H7651]] famine, [[H7458]] and it has already come [[H935]] to [[H413]] the land. [[H776]]

### 2
So the woman [[H802]] got ready [[H6965]] and did [[H6213]] as the man [[H376]] of God [[H430]] had instructed. [[H1697]] She [[H1931]] and her household [[H1004]] lived as foreigners [[H1481]] for seven [[H7651]] years [[H8141]] in the land [[H776]] of the Philistines. [[H6430]]

### 3
At the end [[H7097]] of seven [[H7651]] years, [[H8141]] when the woman [[H802]] returned [[H7725]] from the land [[H776]] of the Philistines, [[H6430]] she went [[H3318]] to [[H413]] the king [[H4428]] to appeal [[H6817]] for [[H413]] her house [[H1004]] and [[H413]] her land. [[H7704]]

### 4
Now the king [[H4428]] had been speaking [[H1696]] to [[H413]] Gehazi, [[H1522]] the servant [[H5288]] of the man [[H376]] of God, [[H430]] saying, [[H559]] “Please [[H4994]] relate [[H5608]] to me  all [[H3605]] the great things [[H1419]] Elisha [[H477]] has done.” [[H6213]]

### 5
And as [[H1961]] Gehazi [[H1931]] was telling [[H5608]] the king [[H4428]] how [[H834]] Elisha had brought the dead [[H4191]] back to life, [[H2421]] the woman [[H802]] whose son [[H1121]] he had revived [[H2421]] came to appeal [[H6817]] to [[H413]] the king [[H4428]] for [[H5921]] her house [[H1004]] and [[H5921]] her land. [[H7704]] So Gehazi [[H1522]] said, [[H559]] “My lord [[H113]] the king, [[H4428]] this [[H2063]] is the woman, [[H802]] and this [[H2088]] is the son [[H1121]] Elisha [[H477]] restored to life. [[H2421]]

### 6
When the king [[H4428]] asked [[H7592]] the woman, [[H802]] she confirmed it. [[H5608]] So the king [[H4428]] appointed [[H5414]] for her  an [[H259]] officer, [[H5631]] saying, [[H559]] “Restore [[H7725]] all [[H3605]] that was hers, [[H834]] along with all [[H3605]] the proceeds [[H8393]] of the field [[H7704]] from the day [[H3117]] that she left [[H5800]] the country [[H776]] until [[H5704]] now. [[H6258]]

### 7
Then Elisha [[H477]] came [[H935]] to Damascus [[H1834]] while Ben-hadad [[H1130]] king [[H4428]] of Aram [[H758]] was sick, [[H2470]] and the king was told, [[H5046]] “The man [[H376]] of God [[H430]] has come [[H935]] here.” [[H2008]]

### 8
So the king [[H4428]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Hazael, [[H2371]] “Take [[H3947]] a gift [[H4503]] in your hand, [[H3027]] go [[H1980]] to meet [[H7125]] the man [[H376]] of God, [[H430]] and inquire of [[H1875]] the LORD [[H3069]] through him, [[H853]] ‘Will I recover [[H2421]] from this [[H2088]] illness?’” [[H2483]]

### 9
So Hazael [[H2371]] went [[H1980]] to meet Elisha, [[H7125]] taking [[H3947]] with him [[H3027]] a gift [[H4503]] of forty [[H705]] camel-loads [[H4853]] of every [[H3605]] good thing [[H2898]] from Damascus. [[H1834]] And he went in [[H935]] and stood [[H5975]] before him [[H6440]] and said, [[H559]] “Your son [[H1121]] Ben-hadad [[H1130]] king [[H4428]] of Aram [[H758]] has sent [[H7971]] me to ask, [[H559]] Will I recover [[H2421]] from this [[H2088]] illness? [[H2483]]

### 10
Elisha [[H477]] answered, [[H559]] “Go [[H1980]] and say to him, [[H559]] ‘You will surely recover.’ [[H2421]] But the LORD [[H3068]] has shown me [[H7200]] that [[H3588]] in fact [[H4191]] he will die.” [[H4191]]

### 11
[Elisha] fixed [[H5975]] his gaze [[H6440]] steadily [[H7760]] [on him] until [[H5704]] Hazael became uncomfortable. [[H954]] Then the man [[H376]] of God [[H430]] began to weep. [[H1058]]

### 12
“Why [[H4069]] is my lord [[H113]] weeping?” [[H1058]] asked [[H559]] Hazael. [[H2371]] “Because [[H3588]] I know [[H3045]] the evil [[H7451]] you will do [[H6213]] to the Israelites,” [[H3478]] [Elisha] replied. [[H559]] “You will set [[H7971]] fire [[H784]] to their fortresses, [[H4013]] kill [[H2026]] their young men [[H970]] with the sword, [[H2719]] dash their little ones [[H5768]] to pieces, [[H7376]] and rip open [[H1234]] their pregnant women.” [[H2030]]

### 13
“But [[H3588]] what [is] [[H4100]] your servant, [[H5650]] a mere dog, [[H3611]] that [[H3588]] he should do [[H6213]] this [[H2088]] monstrous [[H1419]] thing?” [[H1697]] said [[H559]] Hazael. [[H2371]] And Elisha [[H477]] answered, [[H559]] “The LORD [[H3068]] has shown me [[H7200]] that you [will become] [[H854]] king [[H4428]] over [[H5921]] Aram.” [[H758]]

### 14
So Hazael left [[H1980]] Elisha [[H477]] and went [[H935]] to  his master, [[H113]] who asked him, [[H559]] “What [[H4100]] did Elisha [[H477]] say to you?” [[H559]] And he replied, [[H559]] “He told [[H559]] me  you would surely recover.” [[H2421]]

### 15
But [[H1961]] the next day [[H4283]] Hazael took [[H3947]] a thick cloth, [[H4346]] dipped [[H2881]] it in water, [[H4325]] and spread [[H6566]] it over [[H5921]] the king’s face. [[H6440]] So Ben-hadad died, [[H4191]] and Hazael [[H2371]] reigned [[H4427]] in his place. [[H8478]]

### 16
In the fifth [[H2568]] year [[H8141]] of the reign [[H4428]] of Joram [[H3141]] son [[H1121]] of Ahab [[H256]] over Israel, [[H3478]] Jehoram [[H3088]] son [[H1121]] of Jehoshaphat [[H3092]] succeeded his father [[H4427]] as king [[H4428]] of Judah. [[H3063]]

### 17
Jehoram [[H1961]] [was] thirty-two [[H7970]] years old [[H1121]] when he became king, [[H4427]] and he reigned [[H4427]] in Jerusalem [[H3389]] eight [[H8083]] years. [[H8141]]

### 18
And [Jehoram] walked [[H1980]] in the way [[H1870]] of the kings [[H4428]] of Israel, [[H3478]] just as [[H834]] the house [[H1004]] of Ahab [[H256]] had done. [[H6213]] For [[H3588]] he married [[H802]] a daughter [[H1323]] of Ahab [[H256]] and did [[H6213]] evil [[H7451]] in the sight [[H5869]] of the LORD. [[H3068]]

### 19
Yet for the sake [[H4616]] of His servant [[H5650]] David, [[H1732]] the LORD [[H3068]] was unwilling [[H3808]] to destroy [[H7843]] Judah, [[H3063]] since [[H834]] He had promised [[H559]] to maintain [[H5414]] a lamp [[H5216]] for David  [and] his descendants [[H1121]] forever. [[H3605]]

### 20
In the days of Jehoram, [[H3117]] Edom [[H123]] rebelled [[H6586]] against [[H8478]] the hand [[H3027]] of Judah [[H3063]] and appointed [[H4427]] their own [[H5921]] king. [[H4428]]

### 21
So Joram [[H3141]] crossed over [[H5674]] to Zair [[H6811]] with [[H5973]] all [[H3605]] his chariots. [[H7393]] When the Edomites [[H123]] surrounded [[H5437]] him [[H413]] and [[H853]] his chariot [[H7393]] commanders, [[H8269]] he [[H1931]] rose up [[H6965]] and attacked [[H5221]] by night. [[H3915]] His troops, however, [[H5971]] fled [[H5127]] to their homes. [[H168]]

### 22
So to [[H5704]] this [[H2088]] day [[H3117]] Edom [[H123]] has been in rebellion [[H6586]] against [[H8478]] the hand of [[H3027]] Judah. [[H3063]] Likewise, [[H227]] Libnah [[H3841]] rebelled [[H6586]] at the same [[H1931]] time. [[H6256]]

### 23
As for the rest [[H3499]] of the acts [[H1697]] of Joram, [[H3141]] along with all [[H3605]] his accomplishments, [[H834]] are they not written [[H3789]] in the Book [[H5612]] of the Chronicles [[H1697]] of the Kings [[H4428]] of Judah? [[H3063]]

### 24
And Joram [[H3141]] rested [[H7901]] with [[H5973]] his fathers [[H1]] and was buried [[H6912]] with [[H5973]] [them] [[H1]] in the City [[H5892]] of David. [[H1732]] And his son [[H1121]] Ahaziah [[H274]] became king [[H4427]] in his place. [[H8478]]

### 25
In the twelfth [[H8147]] year [[H8141]] of the reign [[H4428]] of Joram [[H3141]] son [[H1121]] of Ahab [[H256]] over Israel, [[H3478]] Ahaziah [[H274]] son [[H1121]] of Jehoram [[H3088]] became king [[H4427]] of Judah. [[H3063]]

### 26
Ahaziah [[H274]] [was] twenty-two [[H6242]] years old [[H1121]] when he became king, [[H4427]] and he reigned [[H4427]] in Jerusalem [[H3389]] one [[H259]] year. [[H8141]] His mother’s [[H517]] name [[H8034]] was Athaliah, [[H6271]] the granddaughter [[H1323]] of Omri [[H6018]] king [[H4428]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

### 27
And [Ahaziah] walked [[H1980]] in the way [[H1870]] of the house [[H1004]] of Ahab [[H256]] and did [[H6213]] evil [[H7451]] in the sight [[H5869]] of the LORD [[H3068]] like the house [[H1004]] of Ahab, [[H256]] for [[H3588]] he [[H1931]] was a son-in-law [[H2860]] of the house [[H1004]] of Ahab. [[H256]]

### 28
Then Ahaziah went [[H1980]] with [[H854]] Joram [[H3141]] son [[H1121]] of Ahab [[H256]] to fight [[H4421]] against [[H5973]] Hazael [[H2371]] king [[H4428]] of Aram [[H758]] at Ramoth-gilead, [[H7433]] and the Arameans [[H761]] wounded [[H5221]] Joram. [[H3141]]

### 29
So King [[H4428]] Joram [[H3141]] returned [[H7725]] to Jezreel [[H3157]] to recover [[H7495]] from [[H4480]] the wounds [[H4347]] that [[H834]] the Arameans [[H761]] had inflicted on him [[H5221]] at Ramah [[H7414]] in his battle [[H3898]] against [[H854]] Hazael [[H2371]] king [[H4428]] of Aram. [[H758]] And Ahaziah [[H274]] son [[H1121]] of Jehoram [[H3088]] king [[H4428]] of Judah [[H3063]] went down [[H3381]] to Jezreel [[H3157]] to visit [[H7200]] Joram [[H3141]] son [[H1121]] of Ahab, [[H256]] since [[H3588]] Joram [[H1931]] had been wounded.
