### 1
Shortly before [[H1961]] the LORD [[H3068]] took [[H5927]] Elijah [[H452]] up to heaven [[H8064]] in a whirlwind, [[H5591]] Elijah [[H452]] and Elisha [[H477]] were on their way [[H1980]] from [[H4480]] Gilgal, [[H1537]]

### 2
and Elijah [[H452]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Elisha, [[H477]] “Please [[H4994]] stay [[H3427]] here, [[H6311]] for [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] has sent me [[H7971]] on to [[H5704]] Bethel.” [[H1008]] But Elisha [[H477]] replied, [[H559]] “As surely as the LORD [[H3068]] lives [[H2416]] and as you yourself [[H5315]] live, [[H2416]] I will not [[H518]] leave you.” [[H5800]] So they went down [[H3381]] to  Bethel. [[H1008]]

### 3
Then the sons [[H1121]] of the prophets [[H5030]] at  Bethel [[H1008]] came out [[H3318]] to [[H413]] Elisha [[H477]] and said, [[H559]] “Do you know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] will take [[H3947]] your master [[H113]] away from [[H5921]] you [[H7218]] today?” [[H3117]] “Yes, [[H1571]] I [[H589]] know,” [[H3045]] he replied. [[H559]] “Do not speak [of it].” [[H2814]]

### 4
And Elijah [[H452]] said to [[H559]] Elisha, [[H477]] “Please [[H4994]] stay [[H3427]] here, [[H6311]] for [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] has sent me [[H7971]] on to Jericho.” [[H3405]] But Elisha replied, [[H559]] “As surely as the LORD [[H3068]] lives [[H2416]] and as you yourself [[H5315]] live, [[H2416]] I will not [[H518]] leave you.” [[H5800]] So they went [[H935]] to Jericho. [[H3405]]

### 5
Then the sons [[H1121]] of the prophets [[H5030]] at Jericho [[H3405]] came up [[H5066]] to [[H413]] Elisha [[H477]] and said, [[H559]] “Do you know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] will take [[H3947]] your master [[H113]] away from [[H5921]] you [[H7218]] today?” [[H3117]] “Yes, [[H1571]] I [[H589]] know,” [[H3045]] he replied. [[H559]] “Do not speak [of it].” [[H2814]]

### 6
And Elijah [[H452]] said [[H559]] to [Elisha],  “Please [[H4994]] stay [[H3427]] here, [[H6311]] for [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] has sent me [[H7971]] on to the Jordan.” [[H3383]] But Elisha replied, [[H559]] “As surely as the LORD [[H3068]] lives [[H2416]] and as you [[H5315]] yourself live, [[H2416]] I will not [[H518]] leave you.” [[H5800]] So the two of them [[H8147]] went on. [[H1980]]

### 7
Then a company [[H582]] of fifty [[H2572]] of the sons [[H1121]] of the prophets [[H5030]] went [[H1980]] and stood [[H5975]] at a distance, [[H5048]] facing [Elijah and Elisha] [[H7350]] as the two [[H8147]] of them stood [[H5975]] by [[H5921]] the Jordan. [[H3383]]

### 8
And Elijah [[H452]] took [[H3947]] his cloak, [[H155]] rolled it up, [[H1563]] and struck [[H5221]] the waters, [[H4325]] which parted [[H2673]] to the right [[H2008]] and to the left, [[H2008]] so that the two [[H8147]] of them crossed over [[H5674]] on dry ground. [[H2724]]

### 9
After [[H1961]] they had crossed over, [[H5674]] Elijah [[H452]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Elisha, [[H477]] “Tell me, [[H7592]] what [[H4100]] can I do [[H6213]] for you  before [[H2962]] I am taken away [[H3947]] from you?” [[H5973]] “Please, [[H4994]] let [[H1961]] me inherit [[H413]] a double [[H8147]] portion [[H6310]] of your spirit,” [[H7307]] Elisha [[H477]] replied. [[H559]]

### 10
“You have requested [[H7592]] a difficult thing,” [[H7185]] said Elijah. [[H559]] “[Nevertheless,] if [[H518]] you see [[H7200]] me [[H853]] as I am taken [[H3947]] from you, [[H853]] it will be [[H1961]] yours.  But if [[H518]] not, [[H369]] then it will not [[H3808]] be [so].” [[H1961]]

### 11
As they [[H1992]] were walking along [[H1980]] and talking together, [[H1696]] suddenly [[H2009]] a chariot [[H7393]] of fire [[H784]] with horses [[H5483]] of fire [[H784]] appeared and separated [[H6504]] the two of them, [[H8147]] and Elijah [[H452]] went up [[H5927]] into heaven [[H8064]] in a whirlwind. [[H5591]]

### 12
As Elisha [[H477]] watched, [[H7200]] he [[H1931]] cried out, [[H6817]] “My father, [[H1]] my father, [[H1]] the chariots [[H7393]] and horsemen [[H6571]] of Israel!” [[H3478]] And he saw [Elijah] [[H7200]] no [[H3808]] more. [[H5750]] So taking hold [[H2388]] of his own clothes, [[H899]] he tore them [[H7167]] in two. [[H8147]]

### 13
Elisha also picked up [[H7311]] the cloak [[H155]] that [[H834]] had fallen [[H5307]] from [[H5921]] Elijah, [[H452]] and he went back [[H7725]] and stood [[H5975]] on [[H5921]] the bank [[H8193]] of the Jordan. [[H3383]]

### 14
Then he took [[H3947]] the cloak [[H155]] of Elijah [[H452]] that [[H834]] had fallen [[H5307]] from him [[H5921]] and struck [[H5221]] the waters. [[H4325]] “Where now [is] [[H346]] the LORD, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of Elijah?” [[H452]] he asked. [[H559]] And when he had struck [[H5221]] the waters, [[H4325]] they parted [[H2673]] to the right [[H2008]] and to the left, [[H2008]] and Elisha [[H477]] crossed over. [[H5674]]

### 15
When the sons [[H1121]] of the prophets [[H5030]] who [were] [[H834]] facing him [[H5048]] from Jericho [[H3405]] saw what had happened, [[H7200]] they said, [[H559]] “The spirit [[H7307]] of Elijah [[H452]] rests [[H5117]] on [[H5921]] Elisha.” [[H477]] And they went [[H935]] to meet him [[H7125]] and bowed down [[H7812]] to the ground [[H776]] before him. 

### 16
“Look [[H2009]] now,” [[H4994]] they said [[H559]] to Elisha, [[H413]] “we your servants [[H5650]] have [[H3426]] fifty [[H2572]] valiant [[H2428]] men. [[H376]] Please [[H4994]] let them go [[H1980]] and search for [[H1245]] your master. [[H113]] Perhaps [[H6435]] the Spirit [[H7307]] of the LORD [[H3068]] has taken him up [[H5375]] and put him [[H7993]] on one [[H259]] of the mountains [[H2022]] or [[H176]] in one [[H259]] of the valleys.” [[H1516]] “Do not [[H3808]] send them,” [[H7971]] [Elisha] replied. [[H559]]

### 17
But when they pressed [[H6484]] him  to the point of [[H5704]] embarrassment, [[H954]] he said, [[H559]] “Send [them].” [[H7971]] And they sent [[H7971]] fifty [[H2572]] men, [[H376]] who searched for [[H1245]] three [[H7969]] days [[H3117]] but did not [[H3808]] find [Elijah]. [[H4672]]

### 18
When they returned [[H7725]] to [Elisha], [[H413]] who [[H1931]] was staying [[H3427]] in Jericho, [[H3405]] he said [[H559]] to them, [[H413]] “Didn't [[H3808]] I tell [[H559]] you [[H413]] not [[H408]] to go?” [[H1980]]

### 19
Then the men [[H376]] of the city [[H5892]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Elisha, [[H477]] “Please [[H4994]] note, [[H2009]] our lord, [[H113]] that the city’s [[H5892]] location [[H4186]] is good, [[H2896]] but the water [[H4325]] [is] bad [[H7451]] and the land [[H776]] is unfruitful.” [[H7921]]

### 20
“Bring [[H3947]] me  a new [[H2319]] bowl,” [[H6746]] he replied, [[H559]] “and put [[H7760]] some salt [[H4417]] in it.” [[H8033]] So they brought [it] [[H3947]] to him, [[H413]]

### 21
and [Elisha] went out [[H3318]] to [[H413]] the spring, [[H4161]] cast [[H7993]] the salt into it, [[H4417]] and said, [[H559]] “This is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] says: [[H559]] ‘I have healed [[H7495]] this [[H428]] water. [[H4325]] No [[H3808]] longer [[H5750]] will it cause [[H1961]] death [[H4194]] or unfruitfulness.’” [[H7921]]

### 22
And the waters [there] [[H4325]] have been healthy [[H7495]] to [[H5704]] this [[H2088]] day, [[H3117]] according to the word [[H1697]] spoken [[H1696]] by Elisha. [[H477]]

### 23
From there, [[H8033]] Elisha went up [[H5927]] to  Bethel, [[H1008]] and as he [[H1931]] was walking up [[H5927]] the road, [[H1870]] a group of young men [[H5288]] came out [[H3318]] of [[H4480]] the city [[H5892]] and jeered at [[H7046]] him,  chanting, [[H559]] “Go up, [[H5927]] you baldhead! [[H7142]] Go up, [[H5927]] you baldhead!” [[H7142]]

### 24
Then he turned [[H6437]] around, [[H310]] looked at them, [[H7200]] and called down a curse on them [[H7043]] in the name [[H8034]] of the LORD. [[H3068]] Suddenly two [[H8147]] female bears [[H1677]] came out [[H3318]] of [[H4480]] the woods [[H3293]] and mauled [[H1234]] forty-two [[H705]] of the young men. [[H3206]]

### 25
And Elisha went [[H1980]] on [[H8033]] to [[H413]] Mount [[H2022]] Carmel, [[H3760]] and from there [[H8033]] he returned [[H7725]] to Samaria. [[H8111]]
