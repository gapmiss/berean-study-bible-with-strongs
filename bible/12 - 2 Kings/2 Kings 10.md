###### 1
Now Ahab [[H256]] had seventy [[H7657]] sons [[H1121]] in Samaria. [[H8111]] So Jehu [[H3058]] wrote [[H3789]] letters [[H5612]] and sent [[H7971]] them to Samaria [[H8111]] to [[H413]] the officials [[H8269]] of Jezreel, [[H3157]] to the elders, [[H2205]] and to [[H413]] the guardians [of the sons] [[H539]] of Ahab, [[H256]] saying: [[H559]]

###### 2
“When this [[H2088]] letter [[H5612]] arrives, [[H935]] since [[H6258]] your master’s [[H113]] sons [[H1121]] are with you [[H854]] and you have [[H854]] chariots [[H7393]] and horses, [[H5483]] a fortified [[H4013]] city [[H5892]] and weaponry, [[H5402]]

###### 3
select [[H7200]] the best [[H2896]] and most worthy [[H3477]] son [[H1121]] of your master, [[H113]] set [[H7760]] him on [[H5921]] his father’s [[H1]] throne, [[H3678]] and fight [[H3898]] for [[H5921]] your master’s [[H113]] house.” [[H1004]]

###### 4
But they were terrified [[H3372]] and reasoned, [[H559]] “If [[H2009]] two [[H8147]] kings [[H4428]] could not [[H3808]] stand [[H5975]] against him, [[H6440]] how [[H349]] can we?” [[H587]]

###### 5
So the palace [[H1004]] administrator, [[H834]] the overseer [[H834]] of the city, [[H5892]] the elders, [[H2205]] and the guardians [[H539]] sent [[H7971]] a message to [[H413]] Jehu: [[H3058]] “We [[H587]] are your servants, [[H5650]] and we will do [[H6213]] whatever [[H3605]] you say. [[H559]] We will not [[H3808]] make anyone [[H376]] king. [[H4427]] Do [[H6213]] [whatever is] good [[H2896]] in your sight.” [[H5869]]

###### 6
Then Jehu wrote [[H3789]] them [[H413]] a second [[H8145]] letter [[H5612]] and said: [[H559]] “If [[H518]] you are on my side, [[H859]] and if you [[H859]] will obey me, [[H8085]] then bring [[H3947]] the heads [[H7218]] of your master’s [[H113]] sons [[H1121]] to me [[H853]] at Jezreel [[H3157]] by this time [[H6256]] tomorrow.” [[H4279]] Now the king’s [[H4428]] sons, [[H1121]] seventy [[H7657]] in all, [[H376]] were being brought up [[H1431]] by the leading men [[H1419]] of the city. [[H5892]]

###### 7
And [[H1961]] when the letter [[H5612]] arrived, [[H935]] they took [[H3947]] the king’s [[H4428]] sons [[H1121]] and slaughtered [[H7819]] all seventy [[H7657]] of them, [[H376]] put [[H7760]] their heads [[H7218]] in baskets, [[H1731]] and sent [[H7971]] them to Jehu [[H413]] at Jezreel. [[H3157]]

###### 8
When the messenger [[H4397]] arrived, [[H935]] he told [[H5046]] [Jehu],  “They have brought [[H935]] the heads [[H7218]] of the king’s [[H4428]] sons.” [[H1121]] And [Jehu] ordered, [[H559]] “Pile [[H7760]] them in two [[H8147]] heaps [[H6652]] at the entrance [[H6607]] of the gate [[H8179]] until [[H5704]] morning.” [[H1242]]

###### 9
The next morning, [[H1242]] [Jehu] went out [[H3318]] and stood [[H5975]] before [[H413]] all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] and said, [[H559]] “You [[H859]] are innocent. [[H6662]] It was I [[H589]] who conspired [[H7194]] against [[H5921]] my master [[H113]] and killed him. [[H2026]] But who [[H4310]] killed [[H5221]] all [[H3605]] these? [[H428]]

###### 10
Know, [[H3045]] then, [[H645]] that [[H3588]] not [[H3808]] a word [[H1697]] the LORD [[H3068]] has spoken [[H1696]] against [[H5921]] the house [[H1004]] of Ahab [[H256]] will fail, [[H5307]] for the LORD [[H3068]] has done [[H6213]] what [[H834]] He promised [[H1696]] through [[H3027]] His servant [[H5650]] Elijah.” [[H452]]

###### 11
So Jehu [[H3058]] killed [[H5221]] everyone [[H3605]] in Jezreel [[H3157]] who remained [[H7604]] of the house [[H1004]] of Ahab, [[H256]] as well as all [[H3605]] his great men [[H1419]] and close friends [[H3045]] and priests, [[H3548]] leaving [[H7604]] him  without [a single] [[H1115]] survivor. [[H8300]]

###### 12
Then [Jehu] set out [[H6965]] toward Samaria. [[H8111]] At [[H1004]] Beth-eked of the Shepherds, [[H7462]]

###### 13
Jehu [[H3058]] met [[H4672]] some relatives [[H251]] of Ahaziah [[H274]] king [[H4428]] of Judah [[H3063]] and asked, [[H559]] “Who [[H4310]] are you?” [[H859]] “We are [[H587]] relatives [[H251]] of Ahaziah,” [[H274]] they answered, [[H559]] “and we have come down [[H3381]] to greet [[H7965]] the sons [[H1121]] of the king [[H4428]] [and] [[H1121]] of the queen mother.” [[H1377]]

###### 14
Then Jehu ordered, [[H559]] “Take [[H8610]] them alive.” [[H2416]] So [his men] took [[H8610]] them alive, [[H2416]] then slaughtered them [[H7819]] at [[H413]] the well [[H953]] of  Beth-eked— [[H1044]] forty-two [[H705]] men. [[H376]] He [[H3808]] spared [[H7604]] none [[H376]] of them. [[H1992]]

###### 15
When he left [[H1980]] there, [[H8033]] he found [[H4672]] Jehonadab [[H3082]] son [[H1121]] of Rechab, [[H7394]] who was coming to meet him. [[H7125]] [Jehu] greeted him [[H1288]] and asked, [[H559]] “Is [[H3426]] your heart [[H3824]] as true to mine [[H3477]] as [[H834]] my heart [[H3824]] is [[H5973]] to yours?” [[H3824]] “It is!” [[H3426]] Jehonadab [[H3082]] replied. [[H559]] “If it is,” said Jehu, [[H3426]] “give [[H5414]] me your hand.” [[H3027]] So he gave [[H5414]] him his hand, [[H3027]] and Jehu helped him [[H5927]] into [[H413]] his chariot, [[H4818]]

###### 16
saying, [[H559]] “Come [[H1980]] with me [[H854]] and see [[H7200]] my zeal [[H7068]] for the LORD!” [[H3068]] So he had him ride [[H7392]] in his chariot. [[H7393]]

###### 17
When Jehu came [[H935]] to Samaria, [[H8111]] he struck down [[H5221]] everyone [[H3605]] belonging to Ahab [[H256]] who remained [[H7604]] [there], [[H8111]] until [[H5704]] he had destroyed them, [[H8045]] according to the word [[H1697]] that [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] had spoken [[H1696]] to [[H413]] Elijah. [[H452]]

###### 18
Then Jehu [[H3058]] brought all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] together [[H6908]] and said, [[H559]] “Ahab [[H256]] served [[H5647]] Baal [[H1168]] a little, [[H4592]] but Jehu [[H3058]] will serve him [[H5647]] a lot. [[H7235]]

###### 19
Now, therefore, [[H6258]] summon [[H7121]] to [[H413]] me all [[H3605]] the prophets [[H5030]] of Baal, [[H1168]] all [[H3605]] his servants, [[H5647]] and all [[H3605]] his priests. [[H3548]] See that no one [[H376]] is missing, [[H6485]] for [[H3588]] I have  a great [[H1419]] sacrifice [[H2077]] for Baal. [[H1168]] Whoever [[H3605]] is missing [[H6485]] will not [[H3808]] live.” [[H2421]] But Jehu [[H3058]] was acting [[H6213]] deceptively [[H6122]] in order to [[H4616]] destroy [[H6]] the servants [[H5647]] of Baal. [[H1168]]

###### 20
And Jehu [[H3058]] commanded, [[H559]] “Proclaim [[H6942]] a solemn assembly [[H6116]] for Baal.” [[H1168]] So they called one. [[H7121]]

###### 21
Then Jehu [[H3058]] sent word [[H7971]] throughout [[H3605]] Israel, [[H3478]] and all [[H3605]] the servants [[H5647]] of Baal [[H1168]] came; [[H935]] there was not [[H3808]] a man [[H376]] who [[H834]] failed [[H3808]] to show up. [[H935]] They entered [[H935]] the temple [[H1004]] of Baal, [[H1168]] and it [[H1004]] was filled [[H4390]] from end [[H6310]] to end. [[H6310]]

###### 22
And [Jehu] said [[H559]] to the keeper [[H834]] of the wardrobe, [[H4458]] “Bring out [[H3318]] garments [[H3830]] for all [[H3605]] the servants [[H5647]] of Baal.” [[H1168]] So he brought out [[H3318]] garments [[H4403]] for them. 

###### 23
Next, Jehu [[H3058]] and Jehonadab [[H3082]] son [[H1121]] of Rechab [[H7394]] entered [[H935]] the temple [[H1004]] of Baal, [[H1168]] and Jehu said [[H559]] to the servants [[H5647]] of Baal, [[H1168]] “Look around [[H2664]] to see [[H7200]] that there are [[H3426]] no [[H6435]] servants [[H5650]] of the LORD [[H3068]] here [[H6311]] among you— [[H5973]] only [[H3588]] servants [[H5647]] of Baal. [[H1168]]

###### 24
And they went in [[H935]] to offer [[H6213]] sacrifices [[H2077]] and burnt offerings. [[H5930]] Now Jehu [[H3058]] had stationed [[H7760]] eighty [[H8084]] men [[H376]] outside [[H2351]] and warned them, [[H559]] “If anyone [[H376]] allows one of [[H4480]] the men [[H376]] I [[H589]] am delivering [[H935]] into [[H5921]] your hands [[H3027]] to escape, [[H4422]] he will forfeit his life [[H5315]] for [[H8478]] theirs. [[H5315]]

###### 25
When he had finished [[H3615]] making [[H6213]] the burnt offering, [[H5930]] Jehu [[H3058]] said [[H559]] to the guards [[H7323]] and officers, [[H7991]] “Go in [[H935]] and kill them. [[H5221]] Do not [[H408]] let anyone [[H376]] out.” [[H3318]] So the guards [[H7323]] and officers [[H7991]] struck them down [[H5221]] with the sword, [[H2719]] threw the bodies out, [[H7993]] and went [[H1980]] into [[H5704]] the inner room [[H5892]] of the temple [[H1004]] of Baal. [[H1168]]

###### 26
They brought out [[H3318]] the [sacred] pillar [[H4676]] of the temple [[H1004]] of Baal [[H1168]] and burned it, [[H8313]]

###### 27
and they demolished [[H5422]] the [sacred] pillar [[H4676]] of Baal. [[H1168]] Then they tore down [[H5422]] the temple [[H1004]] of Baal [[H1168]] and made [[H7760]] it into a latrine, [[H4163]] which it is to [[H5704]] this day. [[H3117]]

###### 28
Thus Jehu [[H3058]] eradicated [[H8045]] Baal [[H1168]] from Israel, [[H3478]]

###### 29
but [[H7535]] he [[H3058]] did not [[H3808]] turn away [[H5493]] from [[H310]] the sins [[H2399]] that Jeroboam [[H3379]] son [[H1121]] of Nebat [[H5028]] had caused Israel [[H3478]] to commit— [[H2398]] the worship of the golden [[H2091]] calves [[H5695]] at Bethel [[H1008]] and Dan. [[H1835]]

###### 30
Nevertheless, the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Jehu, [[H3058]] “Because [[H3282]] you have done well [[H2895]] in carrying out [[H6213]] what is right [[H3477]] in My sight [[H5869]] and have done [[H6213]] to the house [[H1004]] of Ahab [[H256]] all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] was in My heart, [[H3824]] four generations [[H7243]] of your sons [[H1121]] will sit [[H3427]] on [[H5921]] the throne [[H3678]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

###### 31
Yet Jehu [[H3058]] was not [[H3808]] careful [[H8104]] to follow [[H1980]] the instruction [[H8451]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] with all [[H3605]] his heart. [[H3824]] He did not [[H3808]] turn away [[H5493]] from [[H5921]] the sins [[H2403]] that [[H834]] Jeroboam [[H3379]] had caused Israel [[H3478]] to commit. [[H2398]]

###### 32
In those [[H1992]] days [[H3117]] the LORD [[H3068]] began [[H2490]] to reduce the size [[H7096]] of Israel. [[H3478]] Hazael [[H2371]] defeated [[H5221]] the Israelites [[H3478]] throughout [[H3605]] their territory [[H1366]]

###### 33
from [[H4480]] the Jordan [[H3383]] eastward, [[H4217]] all [[H3605]] the land [[H776]] of Gilead [[H1568]] (the region of Gad, [[H1425]] Reuben, [[H7206]] and Manasseh), [[H4520]] and from Aroer [[H6177]] by [[H5921]] the Arnon [[H769]] Valley [[H5158]] through Gilead [[H1568]] to Bashan. [[H1316]]

###### 34
As for the rest [[H3499]] of the acts [[H1697]] of Jehu, [[H3058]] along with all [[H3605]] his accomplishments [[H834]] and all [[H3605]] his might, [[H1369]] are they not written [[H3789]] in the Book [[H5612]] of the Chronicles [[H1697]] of the Kings [[H4428]] of Israel? [[H3478]]

###### 35
And Jehu [[H3058]] rested [[H7901]] with [[H5973]] his fathers [[H1]] and was buried [[H6912]] in Samaria, [[H8111]] and his son [[H1121]] Jehoahaz [[H3059]] became king [[H4427]] in his place. [[H8478]]

###### 36
So the time [[H3117]] of Jehu’s [[H3058]] reign [[H4427]] over [[H5921]] Israel [[H3478]] in Samaria [[H8111]] [was] twenty-eight [[H6242]] years. [[H8141]]
