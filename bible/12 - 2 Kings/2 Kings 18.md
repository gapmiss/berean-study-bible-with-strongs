### 1
In the third [[H7969]] year [[H8141]] of the reign [[H4428]] of Hoshea [[H1954]] son [[H1121]] of Elah [[H425]] over Israel, [[H3478]] Hezekiah [[H2396]] son [[H1121]] of Ahaz [[H271]] became king [[H4427]] of Judah. [[H3063]]

### 2
He was [[H1961]] twenty-five [[H6242]] years old [[H1121]] when he became king, [[H4427]] and he reigned [[H4427]] in Jerusalem [[H3389]] twenty-nine [[H6242]] years. [[H8141]] His mother’s [[H517]] name [[H8034]] was Abi, [[H21]] the daughter [[H1323]] of Zechariah. [[H2148]]

### 3
And he did [[H6213]] [what was] right [[H3477]] in the eyes [[H5869]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] just as [[H3605]] his father [[H1]] David [[H1732]] had done. [[H6213]]

### 4
He removed [[H5493]] the high places, [[H1116]] shattered [[H7665]] the sacred pillars, [[H4676]] and cut down [[H3772]] the Asherah poles. [[H842]] He also demolished [[H3807]] the bronze [[H5178]] serpent [[H5175]] called [[H7121]] Nehushtan [[H5180]] that [[H834]] Moses [[H4872]] had made, [[H6213]] for [[H3588]] up to [[H5704]] that [[H1992]] time [[H3117]] the Israelites [[H1121]] had burned incense [[H6999]] to it. 

### 5
Hezekiah trusted [[H982]] in the LORD, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of Israel. [[H3478]] No [[H3808]] king [[H4428]] of Judah [[H3063]] was [[H1961]] like him, [[H3644]] either before him [[H6440]] or after him. [[H310]]

### 6
He remained faithful [[H1692]] to the LORD [[H3068]] and did not [[H3808]] turn [[H5493]] from following Him; [[H310]] he kept [[H8104]] the commandments [[H4687]] that [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] had given [[H6680]] Moses. [[H4872]]

### 7
And the LORD [[H3068]] was [[H1961]] with [Hezekiah], [[H5973]] and he prospered [[H7919]] wherever [[H3605]] he went. [[H3318]] He rebelled [[H4775]] against the king [[H4428]] of Assyria [[H804]] and refused [[H3808]] to serve him. [[H5647]]

### 8
He [[H1931]] defeated [[H5221]] the Philistines [[H6430]] as [[H5704]] far as Gaza [[H5804]] and its borders, [[H1366]] from [[H4026]] watchtower [[H5341]] to [[H5704]] fortified [[H4013]] city. [[H5892]]

### 9
In the fourth [[H7243]] year [[H8141]] of Hezekiah's [[H2396]] reign, [[H4428]] which [[H1931]] was the seventh [[H7637]] year [[H8141]] of the reign [[H4428]] of Hoshea [[H1954]] son [[H1121]] of Elah [[H425]] over Israel, [[H3478]] Shalmaneser [[H8022]] king [[H4428]] of Assyria [[H804]] marched [[H5927]] against [[H5921]] Samaria [[H8111]] and besieged [[H6696]] it. [[H5921]]

### 10
And at the end [[H7097]] of three [[H7969]] years, [[H8141]] the Assyrians captured it. [[H3920]] So Samaria [[H8111]] was captured [[H3920]] in the sixth [[H8337]] year [[H8141]] of Hezekiah, [[H2396]] which [[H1931]] was the ninth [[H8672]] year [[H8141]] of Hoshea [[H1954]] king [[H4428]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

### 11
The king [[H4428]] of Assyria [[H804]] exiled [[H1540]] the Israelites [[H3478]] to Assyria [[H804]] and settled them [[H5148]] in Halah, [[H2477]] in Gozan [[H1470]] by the Habor [[H2249]] River, [[H5104]] and in the cities [[H5892]] of the Medes. [[H4074]]

### 12
[This happened] because [[H5921]] they did not [[H3808]] listen [[H8085]] to the voice [[H6963]] of the LORD [[H3069]] their God, [[H430]] but violated [[H5674]] His covenant— [[H1285]] all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] Moses [[H4872]] the servant [[H5650]] of the LORD [[H3069]] had commanded— [[H6680]] and would neither [[H3808]] listen [[H8085]] nor [[H3808]] obey. [[H6213]]

### 13
In the fourteenth [[H702]] year [[H8141]] of the reign [[H4428]] of Hezekiah, [[H2396]] Sennacherib [[H5576]] king [[H4428]] of Assyria [[H804]] attacked [[H5927]] and captured [[H8610]] all [[H3605]] the fortified [[H1219]] cities [[H5892]] of Judah. [[H3063]]

### 14
So Hezekiah [[H2396]] king [[H4428]] of Judah [[H3063]] sent [[H7971]] word to [[H413]] the king [[H4428]] of Assyria [[H804]] at Lachish, [[H3923]] saying, [[H559]] “I have done wrong; [[H2398]] withdraw [[H7725]] from me, [[H5921]] and I will pay [[H5375]] whatever [[H834]] you demand [[H5414]] from me.” [[H5921]] And the king [[H4428]] of Assyria [[H804]] exacted [[H7760]] from [[H5921]] Hezekiah [[H2396]] king [[H4428]] of Judah [[H3063]] three [[H7969]] hundred [[H3967]] talents [[H3603]] of silver [[H3701]] and thirty [[H7970]] talents [[H3603]] of gold. [[H2091]]

### 15
Hezekiah [[H2396]] gave [[H5414]] him all [[H3605]] the silver [[H3701]] that was found [[H4672]] in the house [[H1004]] of the LORD [[H3068]] and in the treasuries [[H214]] of the royal [[H4428]] palace. [[H1004]]

### 16
At that [[H1931]] time [[H6256]] Hezekiah [[H2396]] stripped [the gold] [[H7112]] with which [[H2396]] he had plated [[H6823]] the doors [[H1817]] and [[H853]] doorposts [[H547]] of the temple [[H1964]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] and he gave [[H5414]] it to the king [[H4428]] of Assyria. [[H804]]

### 17
Nevertheless, the king [[H4428]] of Assyria [[H804]] sent [[H7971]] the Tartan, [[H8661]] the Rab-saris, [[H7249]] and the Rab-shakeh, [[H7262]] along with a great army, [[H3515]] from [[H4480]] Lachish [[H3923]] to [[H413]] King [[H4428]] Hezekiah [[H2396]] at Jerusalem. [[H3389]] They advanced up [[H5927]] to Jerusalem [[H3389]] and stationed themselves [[H5975]] by the aqueduct [[H8585]] of the upper [[H5945]] pool, [[H1295]] on the road [[H4546]] to the Launderers [[H3526]] Field. [[H7704]]

### 18
Then they called [[H7121]] for [[H413]] the king; [[H4428]] and Eliakim [[H471]] son [[H1121]] of Hilkiah [[H2518]] the palace [[H1004]] administrator, [[H5921]] Shebnah [[H7644]] the scribe, [[H5608]] and Joah [[H3098]] son [[H1121]] of Asaph [[H623]] the recorder, [[H2142]] went out [[H3318]] to them. [[H413]]

### 19
The Rab-shakeh [[H7262]] said [[H559]] to them, [[H413]] “Tell [[H559]] Hezekiah [[H2396]] that this is what [[H3541]] the great [[H1419]] king, [[H4428]] the king [[H4428]] of Assyria, [[H804]] says: [[H559]] What [[H4100]] is the basis [[H982]] [of] this [[H2088]] confidence [[H986]] of yours? [[H834]]

### 20
You claim [[H559]] [to have] a strategy [[H6098]] and strength [[H1369]] for war, [[H4421]] but [[H389]] [these are] empty [[H8193]] words. [[H1697]] On [[H5921]] whom [[H4310]] are you now [[H6258]] relying, [[H982]] that [[H3588]] you have rebelled [[H4775]] against me? 

### 21
Look [[H2009]] now, [[H6258]] you are trusting [[H982]] in [[H5921]] Egypt, [[H4714]] that splintered [[H7533]] reed [[H7070]] of a staff [[H4938]] that will pierce [[H5344]] the hand [[H3709]] of anyone [[H376]] who [[H834]] leans [[H5564]] on it. [[H5921]] Such is [[H3651]] Pharaoh [[H6547]] king [[H4428]] of Egypt [[H4714]] to all [[H3605]] who trust [[H982]] in him. [[H5921]]

### 22
But if [[H3588]] you say [[H559]] to me: [[H413]] ‘We trust [[H982]] in [[H413]] the LORD [[H3068]] our God,’ [[H430]] is He [[H1931]] not [[H3808]] the One [[H834]] whose high places [[H1116]] and altars [[H4196]] Hezekiah [[H2396]] has removed, [[H5493]] saying [[H559]] to Judah [[H3063]] and Jerusalem: [[H3389]] ‘You must worship [[H7812]] before [[H6440]] this [[H2088]] altar [[H4196]] in Jerusalem’? [[H3389]]

### 23
Now, therefore, [[H6258]] make a bargain [[H6148]] with [[H854]] my master, [[H113]] the king [[H4428]] of Assyria. [[H804]] I will give [[H5414]] you  two thousand [[H505]] horses— [[H5483]] if [[H518]] you can [[H3201]] put [[H5414]] riders [[H7392]] on them! [[H5921]]

### 24
For how [[H349]] can you repel [[H7725]] a single [[H259]] officer [[H6346]] among the least [[H6996]] of my master’s [[H113]] servants [[H5650]] when you depend [[H982]] on [[H5921]] Egypt [[H4714]] for chariots [[H7393]] and horsemen? [[H6571]]

### 25
So now, [[H6258]] was it apart from [[H1107]] the LORD [[H3068]] that I have come up [[H5927]] against [[H5921]] this [[H2088]] place [[H4725]] to destroy it? [[H7843]] The LORD Himself [[H3068]] said [[H559]] to me, [[H413]] ‘Go up [[H5927]] against [[H5921]] this [[H2063]] land [[H776]] and destroy it!’” [[H7843]]

### 26
Then Eliakim [[H471]] son [[H1121]] of Hilkiah, [[H2518]] along with Shebnah [[H7644]] and Joah, [[H3098]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] the Rab-shakeh, [[H7262]] “Please [[H4994]] speak [[H1696]] to [[H413]] your servants [[H5650]] in Aramaic, [[H762]] since [[H3588]] we [[H587]] understand it. [[H8085]] Do not [[H408]] speak [[H1696]] to us [[H5973]] in Hebrew [[H3066]] in the hearing [[H241]] of the people [[H5971]] on [[H5921]] the wall. [[H2346]]

### 27
But the Rab-shakeh [[H7262]] replied, [[H559]] “Has my master [[H113]] sent me [[H7971]] to speak [[H1696]] these [[H428]] words [[H1697]] only to [[H5921]] you and [[H413]] your master, [[H113]] and not [[H3808]] to [[H5921]] the men [[H376]] sitting [[H3427]] on [[H5921]] the wall, [[H2346]] who are destined with you [[H5973]] to eat [[H398]] their own dung [[H2755]] and drink [[H8354]] their own urine? [[H7890]]

### 28
Then the Rab-shakeh [[H7262]] stood [[H5975]] and called out [[H7121]] loudly [[H6963]] in Hebrew: [[H3066]] “Hear [[H8085]] the word [[H1697]] of the great [[H1419]] king, [[H4428]] the king [[H4428]] of Assyria! [[H804]]

### 29
This is what [[H3541]] the king [[H4428]] says: [[H559]] Do not [[H408]] let Hezekiah [[H2396]] deceive you; [[H5377]] he cannot [[H3808]] deliver [[H5337]] you [[H853]] from my hand. [[H3027]]

### 30
Do not [[H408]] let Hezekiah [[H2396]] persuade you to trust [[H982]] in [[H413]] the LORD [[H3068]] when he says, [[H559]] ‘The LORD will surely [[H3068]] deliver [[H5337]] us; [[H5337]] this [[H2063]] city [[H5892]] will not [[H3808]] be given [[H5414]] into the hand [[H3027]] of the king [[H4428]] of Assyria.’ [[H804]]

### 31
Do not [[H408]] listen [[H8085]] to [[H413]] Hezekiah, [[H2396]] for [[H3588]] this is what [[H3541]] the king [[H4428]] of Assyria [[H804]] says: [[H559]] Make [[H6213]] peace [[H1293]] with me [[H854]] and come out [[H3318]] to me. [[H413]] Then every one of you [[H376]] will eat [[H398]] from his own vine [[H1612]] his own fig tree, [[H8384]] [and] [[H376]] drink [[H8354]] water [[H4325]] from his own cistern, [[H953]]

### 32
until [[H5704]] I come [[H935]] and take you away [[H3947]] to [[H413]] a land [[H776]] like your own land— [[H776]] a land [[H776]] of grain [[H1715]] and new wine, [[H8492]] a land [[H776]] of bread [[H3899]] and vineyards, [[H3754]] a land [[H776]] of olive trees [[H2132]] and honey— [[H1706]] so that you may live [[H2421]] and not [[H3808]] die. [[H4191]] But do not [[H408]] listen [[H8085]] to [[H413]] Hezekiah, [[H2396]] for [[H3588]] he misleads you [[H5496]] when he says, [[H559]] The LORD [[H3068]] will deliver us. [[H5337]]

### 33
Has the god [[H430]] of any [[H376]] nation [[H1471]] ever [[H5337]] delivered [[H5337]] his land [[H776]] from the hand [[H3027]] of the king [[H4428]] of Assyria? [[H804]]

### 34
Where [[H346]] are the gods [[H430]] of Hamath [[H2574]] and Arpad? [[H774]] Where [[H346]] are the gods [[H430]] of Sepharvaim, [[H5617]] Hena, [[H2012]] and Ivvah? [[H5755]] Have they delivered [[H5337]] Samaria [[H8111]] from my hand? [[H3027]]

### 35
Who [[H4310]] among all [[H3605]] the gods [[H430]] of these lands [[H776]] has delivered [[H5337]] his land [[H776]] from my hand? [[H3027]] How then can the LORD [[H3068]] deliver [[H5337]] Jerusalem [[H3389]] from my hand?’” [[H3027]]

### 36
But the people [[H5971]] remained silent [[H2790]] and did not [[H3808]] answer [[H6030]] a word, [[H1697]] for [[H3588]] [Hezekiah] [[H4428]] had commanded, [[H4687]] “Do not [[H3808]] answer him.” [[H6030]]

### 37
Then Hilkiah's [[H2518]] son [[H1121]] Eliakim [[H471]] the palace [[H1004]] administrator, [[H5921]] Shebna [[H7644]] the scribe, [[H5608]] and Asaph's [[H623]] son [[H1121]] Joah [[H3098]] the recorder, [[H2142]] came [[H935]] to [[H413]] Hezekiah [[H2396]] with their clothes [[H899]] torn, [[H7167]] and they relayed [[H5046]] to him  the words [[H1697]] of  [the] Rab-shakeh. [[H7262]]
