### 1
In the twelfth [[H8147]] year [[H8141]] of the reign [[H4428]] of Ahaz [[H271]] over Judah, [[H3063]] Hoshea [[H1954]] son [[H1121]] of Elah [[H425]] became king [[H4427]] of [[H5921]] Israel, [[H3478]] [and he reigned] in Samaria [[H8111]] nine [[H8672]] years. [[H8141]]

### 2
And he did [[H6213]] evil [[H7451]] in the sight [[H5869]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] but [[H7535]] not [[H3808]] like the kings [[H4428]] of Israel [[H3478]] who [[H834]] preceded [[H1961]] him. [[H6440]]

### 3
Shalmaneser [[H8022]] king [[H4428]] of Assyria [[H804]] attacked [[H5921]] him, [[H5927]] and Hoshea [[H1954]] became [[H1961]] his vassal [[H5650]] and paid [[H7725]] him tribute. [[H4503]]

### 4
But the king [[H4428]] of Assyria [[H804]] discovered [[H4672]] that Hoshea [[H1954]] had conspired [[H7195]] to send [[H7971]] envoys [[H4397]] to [[H413]] King [[H4428]] So [[H5471]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] and that he had not [[H3808]] paid [[H5927]] tribute [[H4503]] to the king [[H4428]] of Assyria [[H804]] as in previous years. [[H8141]] Therefore the king [[H4428]] of Assyria [[H804]] arrested [Hoshea] [[H6113]] and put him [[H631]] in prison. [[H3608]]

### 5
Then the king [[H4428]] of Assyria [[H804]] invaded [[H5927]] the whole [[H3605]] land, [[H776]] marched up [[H5927]] to Samaria, [[H8111]] and besieged [[H6696]] it [[H5921]] for three [[H7969]] years. [[H8141]]

### 6
In the ninth [[H8671]] year [[H8141]] [of the reign] of Hoshea, [[H1954]] the king [[H4428]] of Assyria [[H804]] captured [[H3920]] Samaria [[H8111]] and carried away [[H1540]] the Israelites [[H3478]] to Assyria, [[H804]] where he settled [[H3427]] them [[H853]] in Halah, [[H2477]] in Gozan [[H1470]] by the Habor [[H2249]] River, [[H5104]] and in the cities [[H5892]] of the Medes. [[H4074]]

### 7
All this happened [[H1961]] because [[H3588]] the people [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] had sinned [[H2398]] against the LORD [[H3068]] their God, [[H430]] who had brought [[H5927]] them [[H853]] out of the land [[H776]] of Egypt [[H4714]] from under [[H8478]] the hand [[H3027]] of Pharaoh [[H6547]] king [[H4428]] of Egypt. [[H4714]] They had worshiped [[H3372]] other [[H312]] gods, [[H430]]

### 8
and they had walked [[H1980]] in the customs [[H2708]] of the nations [[H1471]] whom [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] had driven out [[H3423]] before [[H6440]] the Israelites, [[H1121]] as well as in the practices [[H834]] introduced [[H6213]] by the kings [[H4428]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

### 9
The Israelites [[H1121]] secretly did [[H2644]] things against [[H5921]] the LORD [[H3068]] their God [[H430]] that [were] [[H834]] not [[H3808]] right. [[H3651]] From watchtower [[H4026]] to [[H5704]] fortified [[H4013]] city, [[H5892]] they built [[H1129]] high places [[H1116]] in all [[H3605]] their cities. [[H5892]]

### 10
They set up [[H5324]] for themselves  [sacred] pillars [[H4676]] and Asherah poles [[H842]] on [[H5921]] every [[H3605]] high [[H1364]] hill [[H1389]] and under [[H8478]] every [[H3605]] green [[H7488]] tree. [[H6086]]

### 11
They burned incense [[H6999]] on all [[H3605]] the high places [[H1116]] like the nations [[H1471]] whom [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] had driven out [[H1540]] before them. [[H6440]] They did [[H6213]] wicked [[H7451]] things, [[H1697]] provoking [[H3707]] the LORD {to anger}. [[H3068]]

### 12
They served [[H5647]] idols, [[H1544]] although the LORD [[H3068]] had told them, [[H559]] “You shall not [[H3808]] do [[H6213]] this.” [[H2088]]

### 13
Yet through [[H3027]] all [[H3605]] His prophets [[H5030]] [and] [[H3605]] seers, [[H2374]] the LORD [[H3068]] warned [[H5749]] Israel [[H3478]] and Judah, [[H3063]] saying, [[H559]] “Turn [[H7725]] from your wicked [[H7451]] ways [[H1870]] and keep [[H8104]] My commandments [[H4687]] and statutes, [[H2708]] according to the entire [[H3605]] Law [[H8451]] that [[H834]] I commanded [[H6680]] your forefathers [[H1]] and delivered [[H7971]] to you [[H413]] through [[H3027]] My servants [[H5650]] the prophets. [[H5030]]

### 14
But they would not [[H3808]] listen, [[H8085]] and they stiffened [[H7185]] their necks [[H6203]] like their fathers, [[H1]] who [[H834]] did not [[H3808]] believe [[H539]] the LORD [[H3068]] their God. [[H430]]

### 15
They rejected [[H3988]] His statutes [[H2706]] and the covenant [[H1285]] He had made [[H3772]] with [[H854]] their fathers, [[H1]] as well as the decrees [[H5715]] He had given them. [[H5749]] They pursued [[H1980]] worthless idols [[H1892]] and themselves became worthless, [[H1891]] going after [[H310]] the surrounding [[H5439]] nations [[H1471]] the LORD [[H3068]] had commanded [[H6680]] them not [[H1115]] to imitate. [[H6213]]

### 16
They abandoned [[H5800]] all [[H3605]] the commandments [[H4687]] of the LORD [[H3068]] their God [[H430]] and made [[H6213]] for themselves  two [[H8147]] cast idols [[H4541]] of calves [[H5695]] and an Asherah pole. [[H842]] They bowed down to [[H7812]] all [[H3605]] the host [[H6635]] of heaven [[H8064]] and served [[H5647]] Baal. [[H1168]]

### 17
They sacrificed [[H5674]] their sons [[H1121]] and daughters [[H1323]] in the fire [[H784]] and practiced [[H7080]] divination [[H7081]] and soothsaying. [[H5172]] They devoted themselves [[H4376]] to doing [[H6213]] evil [[H7451]] in the sight [[H5869]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] provoking Him to anger. [[H3707]]

### 18
So the LORD [[H3068]] was very [[H3966]] angry [[H599]] with Israel, [[H3478]] and He removed [[H5493]] them from [[H5921]] His presence. [[H6440]] Only [[H7535]] the tribe [[H7626]] of Judah [[H3063]] remained, [[H7604]]

### 19
and even [[H1571]] Judah [[H3063]] did not [[H3808]] keep [[H8104]] the commandments [[H4687]] of the LORD [[H3068]] their God, [[H430]] but lived [[H1980]] according to the customs [[H2708]] Israel [[H3478]] had introduced. [[H6213]]

### 20
So the LORD [[H3068]] rejected [[H3988]] all [[H3605]] the descendants [[H2233]] of Israel. [[H3478]] He afflicted them [[H6031]] and delivered them [[H5414]] into the hands [[H3027]] of plunderers, [[H8154]] until [[H834]] He had banished them [[H7993]] from His presence. [[H6440]]

### 21
When [[H3588]] [the LORD] had torn [[H7167]] Israel [[H3478]] away from [[H5921]] the house [[H1004]] of David, [[H1732]] they made Jeroboam [[H3379]] son [[H1121]] of Nebat [[H5028]] king, [[H4427]] and Jeroboam [[H3379]] led Israel [[H3478]] away from following [[H310]] the LORD [[H3068]] and caused them to commit [[H2398]] a great [[H1419]] sin. [[H2401]]

### 22
The Israelites [[H1121]] persisted [[H1980]] in all [[H3605]] the sins [[H2403]] that [[H834]] Jeroboam [[H3379]] committed [[H6213]] and did not [[H3808]] turn away [[H5493]] from them. [[H4480]]

### 23
Finally, [[H5704]] the LORD [[H3068]] removed [[H5493]] Israel [[H3478]] from [[H5921]] His presence, [[H6440]] as [[H834]] He had declared [[H1696]] through [[H3027]] all [[H3605]] His servants [[H5650]] the prophets. [[H5030]] So Israel [[H3478]] was exiled [[H1540]] from [[H5921]] their homeland [[H127]] into Assyria, [[H804]] [where they are] to [[H5704]] this [[H2088]] day. [[H3117]]

### 24
Then the king [[H4428]] of Assyria [[H804]] brought [[H935]] people from Babylon, [[H894]] Cuthah, [[H3575]] Avva, [[H5755]] Hamath, [[H2574]] and Sepharvaim [[H5617]] and settled them [[H3427]] in the towns [[H5892]] of Samaria [[H8111]] to replace [[H8478]] the Israelites. [[H1121]] They took possession of [[H3423]] Samaria [[H8111]] and lived [[H3427]] in its towns. [[H5892]]

### 25
Now [[H1961]] when [the settlers] first [[H8462]] lived [[H3427]] there, [[H8033]] they did not [[H3808]] worship [[H3372]] the LORD, [[H3068]] so He [[H3068]] sent [[H7971]] lions among them, [[H738]] which [[H1961]] killed [some] [[H2026]] of them. 

### 26
So they spoke [[H559]] to the king [[H4428]] of Assyria, [[H804]] saying, [[H559]] “The peoples [[H1471]] that [[H834]] you have removed [[H1540]] and placed [[H3427]] in the cities [[H5892]] of Samaria [[H8111]] do not [[H3808]] know [[H3045]] the requirements [[H4941]] of the God [[H430]] of the land. [[H776]] Because of this, [[H834]] He has sent [[H7971]] lions [[H738]] among them,  which are indeed [[H2009]] killing them off. [[H4191]]

### 27
Then the king [[H4428]] of Assyria [[H804]] commanded: [[H6680]] “Send back [[H1980]] one [[H259]] of the priests [[H3548]] you carried off [[H1540]] from [Samaria], [[H8033]] and have him go back [[H1980]] to live [[H3427]] there [[H8033]] and teach [[H3384]] the requirements [[H4941]] of the God [[H430]] of the land.” [[H776]]

### 28
Thus one [[H259]] of the priests [[H3548]] they had carried away [[H1540]] came [[H935]] and lived [[H3427]] in Bethel, [[H1008]] and he began to teach [[H3384]] them how [[H349]] they should worship [[H3372]] the LORD. [[H3068]]

### 29
Nevertheless, [[H1961]] the people of each nation [[H1471]] continued to make [[H6213]] their own gods [[H430]] in the cities [[H5892]] where [[H834]] they [[H1992]] had settled, [[H3427]] and they set them up [[H3240]] in the shrines [[H1004]] that [[H834]] the people [[H1471]] of Samaria [[H8118]] had made [[H6213]] on the high places. [[H1116]]

### 30
The men [[H376]] of Babylon [[H894]] made [[H6213]] Succoth-benoth, [[H5524]] the men [[H376]] of Cuth [[H3575]] made [[H6213]] Nergal, [[H5370]] the men [[H376]] of Hamath [[H2574]] made [[H6213]] Ashima, [[H807]]

### 31
the Avvites [[H5757]] made [[H6213]] Nibhaz [[H5026]] and Tartak, [[H8662]] and the Sepharvites [[H5616]] burned [[H8313]] their children [[H1121]] in the fire [[H784]] to Adrammelech [[H152]] and Anammelech [[H6048]] the gods [[H433]] of the Sepharvaim. [[H5617]]

### 32
So [[H1961]] [the new residents] worshiped [[H3372]] the LORD, [[H3069]] but they also appointed [[H6213]] for themselves [[H1992]] priests [[H3548]] of all sorts [[H7098]] to serve [[H6213]] in the shrines [[H1004]] of the high places. [[H1116]]

### 33
They worshiped [[H3372]] the LORD, [[H3068]] but they also served [[H5647]] their own gods [[H430]] according to the customs [[H4941]] of the nations [[H1471]] from which [[H834]] they had been carried away. [[H1540]]

### 34
To [[H5704]] this [[H2088]] day [[H3117]] they [[H1992]] are still practicing [[H6213]] their former [[H7223]] customs. [[H4941]] None [[H369]] of them worship [[H3372]] the LORD [[H3068]] or observe [[H6213]] the statutes, [[H2708]] ordinances, [[H4941]] laws, [[H8451]] and commandments [[H4687]] that [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] gave [[H6680]] the descendants [[H1121]] of Jacob, [[H3290]] whom He named [[H7760]] Israel. [[H3478]]

### 35
For the LORD [[H3068]] had made [[H3772]] a covenant [[H1285]] with [the Israelites] [[H854]] and commanded them, [[H6680]] “Do not [[H3808]] worship [[H3372]] other [[H312]] gods [[H430]] [or] [[H3808]] bow down to them; [[H7812]] do not [[H3808]] serve them [[H5647]] [or] [[H3808]] sacrifice to them. [[H2076]]

### 36
Instead, [[H3588]] worship [[H3372]] the LORD, [[H3068]] who [[H834]] brought [[H5927]] you [[H853]] out of the land [[H776]] of Egypt [[H4714]] with great [[H1419]] power [[H3581]] and an outstretched [[H5186]] arm. [[H2220]] You are to bow down [[H7812]] to Him  and offer sacrifices to Him. [[H2076]]

### 37
And [[H853]] you must always [[H3605]] be careful [[H8104]] to observe [[H6213]] the statutes, [[H2706]] ordinances, [[H4941]] laws, [[H8451]] and commandments [[H4687]] He wrote [[H3789]] for you.  Do not [[H3808]] worship [[H3372]] other [[H312]] gods. [[H430]]

### 38
Do not [[H3808]] forget [[H7911]] the covenant [[H1285]] I have made [[H3772]] with you. [[H854]] Do not [[H3808]] worship [[H3372]] other [[H312]] gods, [[H430]]

### 39
but [[H3588]] worship [[H3372]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God, [[H430]] and He [[H1931]] will deliver [[H5337]] you [[H853]] from the hands [[H3027]] of all [[H3605]] your enemies.” [[H341]]

### 40
But they would not [[H3808]] listen, [[H8085]] and [[H3588]] they persisted in [[H6213]] their former [[H7223]] customs. [[H4941]]

### 41
So [[H1961]] these [[H428]] nations [[H1471]] worshiped [[H3372]] the LORD [[H3068]] but also served [[H5647]] their idols, [[H6456]] and [[H1961]] to [[H5704]] this [[H2088]] day [[H3117]] their children [[H1121]] and grandchildren [[H1121]] continue to do [[H6213]] as [[H834]] their fathers [[H1]] did. [[H6213]]
