###### 1
In the twenty-third [[H6242]] year [[H8141]] of the reign [[H4428]] of Joash [[H3101]] son [[H1121]] of Ahaziah [[H274]] over Judah, [[H3063]] Jehoahaz [[H3059]] son [[H1121]] of Jehu [[H3058]] became king [[H4427]] of [[H5921]] Israel, [[H3478]] [and he reigned] in Samaria [[H8111]] seventeen [[H7651]] years. [[H8141]]

###### 2
And he did [[H6213]] evil [[H7451]] in the sight [[H5869]] of the LORD [[H3068]] and followed [[H1980]] the sins [[H2403]] that [[H834]] Jeroboam [[H3379]] son [[H1121]] of Nebat [[H5028]] had caused Israel [[H3478]] to commit; [[H2398]] he did not [[H3808]] turn away [[H5493]] from them. [[H4480]]

###### 3
So the anger [[H639]] of the LORD [[H3068]] burned [[H2734]] against Israel, [[H3478]] and He delivered them [[H5414]] continually [[H3605]] into the hands [[H3027]] of Hazael [[H2371]] king [[H4428]] of Aram [[H758]] and his [[H2371]] son [[H1121]] Ben-hadad. [[H1130]]

###### 4
Then Jehoahaz [[H3059]] sought [[H2470]] the favor [[H6440]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] and the LORD [[H3068]] listened [[H8085]] to him [[H413]] because [[H3588]] He saw [[H7200]] the oppression [[H3906]] that the king [[H4428]] of Aram [[H758]] had inflicted [[H3905]] on Israel. [[H3478]]

###### 5
So the LORD [[H3068]] gave [[H5414]] Israel [[H3478]] a deliverer, [[H3467]] and they escaped [[H3318]] the power [[H3027]] of the Arameans. [[H758]] Then the people [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] lived [[H3427]] in their own homes [[H168]] as they had before. [[H8543]]

###### 6
Nevertheless, [[H389]] they did not [[H3808]] turn away [[H5493]] from the sins [[H2403]] that [[H834]] the house [[H1004]] of Jeroboam [[H3379]] had caused Israel [[H3478]] to commit, [[H2398]] [but] they continued to walk in them. [[H1980]] The Asherah [[H842]] even [[H1571]] remained standing [[H5975]] in Samaria. [[H8111]]

###### 7
Jehoahaz [[H3059]] had no [[H3808]] army [[H5971]] left, [[H7604]] except [[H3588]] fifty [[H2572]] horsemen, [[H6571]] ten [[H6235]] chariots, [[H7393]] and ten [[H6235]] thousand [[H505]] foot soldiers, [[H7273]] because [[H3588]] the king [[H4428]] of Aram [[H758]] had destroyed them [[H6]] and made them [[H7760]] like the dust [[H6083]] at threshing. [[H1758]]

###### 8
As for the rest [[H3499]] of the acts [[H1697]] of Jehoahaz, [[H3059]] along with all [[H3605]] his accomplishments [[H834]] and his might, [[H1369]] are they not written [[H3789]] in the Book [[H5612]] of the Chronicles [[H1697]] of the Kings [[H4428]] of Israel? [[H3478]]

###### 9
And Jehoahaz [[H3059]] rested [[H7901]] with [[H5973]] his fathers [[H1]] and was buried [[H6912]] in Samaria. [[H8111]] And his son [[H1121]] Jehoash [[H3101]] became king [[H4427]] in his place. [[H8478]]

###### 10
In the thirty-seventh [[H7970]] year [[H8141]] of the reign [[H4428]] of Joash [[H3101]] over Judah, [[H3063]] Jehoash [[H3060]] son [[H1121]] of Jehoahaz [[H3059]] became king [[H4427]] of [[H5921]] Israel [[H3478]] in Samaria, [[H8111]] [and he reigned] sixteen [[H8337]] years. [[H8141]]

###### 11
And he did [[H6213]] evil [[H7451]] in the sight [[H5869]] of the LORD [[H3068]] and did not [[H3808]] turn away [[H5493]] from all [[H3605]] the sins [[H2403]] that [[H834]] Jeroboam [[H3379]] son [[H1121]] of Nebat [[H5028]] had caused Israel [[H3478]] to commit, [[H2398]] but he walked in them. [[H1980]]

###### 12
As for the rest [[H3499]] of the acts [[H1697]] of Jehoash, [[H3101]] along with all [[H3605]] his accomplishments [[H834]] and his might, [[H1369]] including his war [[H3898]] against [[H5973]] Amaziah [[H558]] king [[H4428]] of Judah, [[H3063]] are they not written [[H3789]] in the Book [[H5612]] of the Chronicles [[H1697]] of the Kings [[H4428]] of Israel? [[H3478]]

###### 13
And Jehoash [[H3101]] rested [[H7901]] with [[H5973]] his fathers, [[H1]] and Jeroboam [[H3379]] succeeded him [[H3427]] on [[H5921]] the throne. [[H3678]] Jehoash [[H3101]] was buried [[H6912]] in Samaria [[H8111]] with [[H5973]] the kings [[H4428]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

###### 14
When Elisha [[H477]] had fallen sick [[H2470]] with the illness [[H2483]] from which [[H834]] he would die, [[H4191]] Jehoash [[H3101]] king [[H4428]] of Israel [[H3478]] came down [[H3381]] to him [[H413]] and wept [[H1058]] over [[H5921]] him, [[H6440]] saying, [[H559]] “My father, [[H1]] my father, [[H1]] the chariots [[H7393]] and horsemen [[H6571]] of Israel!” [[H3478]]

###### 15
Elisha [[H477]] told [[H559]] him,  “Take [[H3947]] a bow [[H7198]] and some arrows.” [[H2671]] So he himself took [[H3947]] a bow [[H7198]] and some arrows. [[H2671]]

###### 16
Then Elisha said [[H559]] to the king [[H4428]] of Israel, [[H3478]] “Put [[H7392]] your hand [[H3027]] on [[H5921]] the bow.” [[H7198]] So the king put [[H7392]] his hand on [the bow], [[H3027]] and Elisha [[H477]] put [[H7760]] his hands [[H3027]] on [[H5921]] the king’s [[H4428]] hands. [[H3027]]

###### 17
“Open [[H6605]] the east [[H6924]] window,” [[H2474]] said Elisha. [[H559]] So he opened [it] [[H6605]] and Elisha [[H477]] said, [[H559]] “Shoot!” [[H3384]] So he shot. [[H3384]] Then Elisha declared, [[H559]] “This is the LORD’s [[H3068]] arrow [[H2671]] of victory, [[H8668]] the arrow [[H2671]] of victory [[H8668]] over Aram, [[H758]] for you shall strike [[H5221]] the Arameans [[H758]] in Aphek [[H663]] until [[H5704]] you have put an end to them.” [[H3615]]

###### 18
Then Elisha said, [[H559]] “Take [[H3947]] the arrows!” [[H2678]] So he took [them], [[H3947]] and Elisha said [[H559]] to the king [[H4428]] of Israel, [[H3478]] “Strike [[H5221]] the ground!” [[H776]] So he struck [[H5221]] the ground three [[H7969]] times [[H6471]] and stopped. [[H5975]]

###### 19
But the man [[H376]] of God [[H430]] was angry [[H7107]] with [[H5921]] him and said, [[H559]] “You should have struck [[H5221]] the ground five [[H2568]] or [[H176]] six [[H8337]] times. [[H6471]] Then [[H227]] you would have struck down [[H5221]] Aram [[H758]] until [[H5704]] you had put an end to it. [[H3615]] But now [[H6258]] you will strike down [[H5221]] Aram [[H758]] [only] three [[H7969]] times.” [[H6471]]

###### 20
And Elisha [[H477]] died [[H4191]] and was buried. [[H6912]] Now the Moabite [[H4124]] raiders [[H1416]] used to come [[H935]] into the land [[H776]] every spring. [[H935]]

###### 21
Once, [[H1961]] as the Israelites [[H1992]] were burying [[H6912]] a man, [[H376]] suddenly [[H2009]] they saw [[H7200]] a band [of raiders], [[H1416]] so they threw [[H7993]] the man's body [[H376]] into Elisha’s [[H477]] tomb. [[H6913]] And when he touched [[H5060]] the bones [[H6106]] of Elisha, [[H477]] the man [[H376]] was revived [[H2421]] and stood [[H6965]] up on his feet. [[H7272]]

###### 22
And Hazael [[H2371]] king [[H4428]] of Aram [[H758]] oppressed [[H3905]] Israel [[H3478]] throughout [[H3605]] the reign [[H3117]] of Jehoahaz. [[H3059]]

###### 23
But the LORD [[H3068]] was gracious to them [[H2603]] and had compassion on them, [[H7355]] and He turned [[H6437]] toward them [[H413]] because of [[H4616]] His covenant [[H1285]] with [[H854]] Abraham, [[H85]] Isaac, [[H3327]] and Jacob. [[H3290]] And to this day, [[H6258]] He has been unwilling [[H14]] to destroy them [[H7843]] or [[H3808]] cast them [[H7993]] from [[H5921]] His presence. [[H6440]]

###### 24
When Hazael [[H2371]] king [[H4428]] of Aram [[H758]] died, [[H4191]] his son [[H1121]] Ben-hadad [[H1130]] became king [[H4427]] in his place. [[H8478]]

###### 25
Then Jehoash [[H3060]] son [[H1121]] of Jehoahaz [[H3059]] took [[H3947]] back [[H7725]] from [[H3027]] Ben-hadad [[H1130]] son [[H1121]] of Hazael [[H2371]] the cities [[H5892]] that [[H834]] Hazael had taken [[H3947]] in battle [[H4421]] from [[H3027]] his father [[H1]] Jehoahaz. [[H3059]] Jehoash [[H3101]] defeated [[H5221]] Ben-hadad three [[H7969]] times, [[H6471]] and so recovered [[H7725]] the cities [[H5892]] of Israel. [[H3478]]
