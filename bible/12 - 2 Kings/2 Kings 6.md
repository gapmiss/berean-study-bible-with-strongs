### 1
Now the sons [[H1121]] of the prophets [[H5030]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Elisha, [[H477]] “Please [[H4994]] take note [[H2009]] that the place [[H4725]] where [[H834]] we [[H587]] meet [[H3427]] with you [[H6440]] is too small [[H6862]] for us. [[H4480]]

### 2
Please [[H4994]] let us go [[H1980]] to [[H5704]] the Jordan, [[H3383]] where [[H8033]] each of us [[H376]] can get [[H3947]] a [[H259]] log [[H6982]] so we can build [[H6213]] ourselves a place [[H4725]] to live [[H3427]] there.” [[H8033]] “Go,” [[H1980]] said [Elisha]. [[H559]]

### 3
Then one of them [[H259]] said, [[H559]] “Please [[H4994]] come [[H1980]] with [[H854]] your servants.” [[H5650]] “I will [[H589]] come,” [[H1980]] he replied. [[H559]]

### 4
So [Elisha] went [[H1980]] with them, [[H854]] and when they came [[H935]] to the Jordan, [[H3383]] they began to cut down [[H1504]] some trees. [[H6086]]

### 5
As one [[H259]] of them was cutting down [[H5307]] a tree, [[H6982]] the iron [axhead] [[H1270]] fell [[H5307]] into [[H413]] the water. [[H4325]] “Oh, [[H162]] my master,” [[H113]] he cried out, [[H6817]] “it [[H1931]] was borrowed!” [[H7592]]

### 6
“Where [[H575]] did it fall?” [[H5307]] asked [[H559]] the man [[H376]] of God. [[H430]] And when he showed [[H7200]] him the place, [[H4725]] the man of God cut [[H7094]] a stick, [[H6086]] threw [[H7993]] it there, [[H8033]] and made the iron [[H1270]] float. [[H6687]]

### 7
“Lift [it] out,” [[H7311]] he said, [[H559]] and [the man] reached out [[H7971]] his hand [[H3027]] and took it. [[H3947]]

### 8
Now the king [[H4428]] of Aram [[H758]] was [[H1961]] at war [[H3898]] against Israel. [[H3478]] After consulting [[H3289]] with [[H413]] his servants, [[H5650]] he said, [[H559]] “My camp [will be] [[H8466]] in [[H413]] such [[H6423]] and such [[H492]] a place.” [[H4725]]

### 9
Then the man [[H376]] of God [[H430]] sent [[H7971]] word to [[H413]] the king [[H4428]] of Israel: [[H3478]] “Be careful [[H8104]] passing by [[H5674]] this [[H2088]] place, [[H4725]] for [[H3588]] the Arameans [[H758]] are going down [[H5181]] there.” [[H8033]]

### 10
So the king [[H4428]] of Israel [[H3478]] sent [[H7971]] word to [[H413]] the place [[H4725]] the man [[H376]] of God [[H430]] had pointed out. [[H559]] Time and again [[H259]] [Elisha] warned the king, [[H2094]] so that he was on his guard [[H8104]] in such places. [[H8033]]

### 11
For [[H5921]] this [[H2088]] reason, [[H1697]] the king [[H4428]] of Aram [[H758]] became enraged [[H5590]] and called [[H7121]] his servants [[H5650]] to demand [[H559]] of them, [[H413]] “Tell me, [[H5046]] which one [[H4310]] of us [[H7945]] [is] on the side [[H413]] of the king [[H4428]] of Israel?” [[H3478]]

### 12
But one [[H259]] of his servants [[H5650]] replied, [[H559]] “No one, [[H3808]] my lord [[H113]] the king. [[H4428]] For [[H3588]] Elisha, [[H477]] the prophet [[H5030]] in Israel, [[H3478]] tells [[H5046]] the king [[H4428]] of Israel [[H3478]] the very words [[H1697]] you speak [[H1696]] in your bedroom.” [[H2315]]

### 13
So the king said, [[H559]] “Go [[H1980]] and see [[H7200]] where [[H351]] he [is], [[H1931]] that I may send [[H7971]] men to capture him.” [[H3947]] On receiving the report, [[H5046]] “Elisha is in Dothan,” [[H1886]]

### 14
[the king of Aram] sent [[H7971]] horses, [[H5483]] chariots, [[H7393]] and a great [[H3515]] army. [[H2428]] They went there [[H935]] by night [[H3915]] and surrounded [[H5362]] the city. [[H5892]]

### 15
When the servant [[H8334]] of the man [[H376]] of God [[H430]] got up [[H6965]] and went out [[H3318]] early in the morning, [[H7925]] an army [[H2428]] with horses [[H5483]] and chariots [[H7393]] had surrounded [[H5437]] the city. [[H5892]] So he [[H5288]] asked Elisha, [[H559]] “Oh, [[H162]] my master, [[H113]] what [[H349]] are we to do?” [[H6213]]

### 16
“Do not [[H408]] be afraid,” [[H3372]] Elisha answered, [[H559]] “for [[H3588]] those who [are] [[H834]] with us [[H854]] [are] more [[H7227]] than those who [are] [[H834]] with them.” [[H854]]

### 17
Then Elisha [[H477]] prayed, [[H6419]] “O LORD, [[H3068]] please [[H4994]] open [[H6491]] his eyes [[H5869]] that he may see.” [[H7200]] And the LORD [[H3068]] opened [[H6491]] the eyes [[H5869]] of the young man, [[H5288]] and he saw that [[H7200]] the hills [[H2022]] were full of [[H4390]] horses [[H5483]] and chariots [[H7393]] of fire [[H784]] all around [[H5439]] Elisha. [[H477]]

### 18
As the Arameans came down [[H3381]] against him, [[H413]] Elisha [[H477]] prayed [[H6419]] to [[H413]] the LORD, [[H3068]] “Please [[H4994]] strike [[H5221]] these [[H2088]] people [[H1471]] with blindness.” [[H5575]] So He struck [[H5221]] them with blindness, [[H5575]] according to the word [[H1697]] of Elisha. [[H477]]

### 19
And Elisha [[H477]] told [[H559]] them, [[H413]] “This [[H2088]] is not [[H3808]] the way, [[H1870]] and this [[H2090]] is not [[H3808]] the city. [[H5892]] Follow [[H1980]] me, [[H310]] and I will take [[H1980]] you to [[H413]] the man [[H376]] you are seeking.” [[H1245]] And he led [[H1980]] them to Samaria. [[H8111]]

### 20
When they had entered [[H935]] Samaria, [[H8111]] Elisha [[H477]] said, [[H559]] “O LORD, [[H3068]] open [[H6491]] the eyes [[H5869]] of these [men] [[H428]] that they may see.” [[H7200]] Then the LORD [[H3068]] opened [[H6491]] their eyes, [[H5869]] and they looked around [[H7200]] and discovered [[H2009]] they were in [[H8432]] Samaria. [[H8111]]

### 21
And when the king [[H4428]] of Israel [[H3478]] saw [[H7200]] them, [[H853]] he asked [[H559]] Elisha, [[H477]] “My father, [[H1]] shall I kill [them]? [[H5221]] Shall I kill [them]?” [[H5221]]

### 22
“Do not [[H3808]] kill them,” [[H5221]] he replied. [[H559]] “Would you [[H859]] kill [[H5221]] those [[H834]] you have captured [[H7617]] with your own sword [[H2719]] or bow? [[H7198]] Set [[H7760]] food [[H3899]] and water [[H4325]] before them, [[H6440]] that they may eat [[H398]] and drink [[H8354]] and then return [[H1980]] to [[H413]] their master.” [[H113]]

### 23
So [the king] prepared a great [[H1419]] feast [[H3739]] for them, [[H3740]] and after they had finished eating [[H398]] and drinking, [[H8354]] he sent them away, [[H7971]] and they returned [[H1980]] to [[H413]] their master. [[H113]] And the Aramean [[H758]] raiders [[H1416]] did not [[H3808]] come [[H935]] into the land [[H776]] of Israel [[H3478]] again. [[H3254]]

### 24
Some time later, [[H310]] Ben-hadad [[H1130]] king [[H4428]] of Aram [[H758]] assembled [[H6908]] his entire [[H3605]] army [[H4264]] and marched up [[H5927]] to besiege [[H6696]] Samaria. [[H8111]]

### 25
So there was [[H1961]] a great [[H1419]] famine [[H7458]] in Samaria. [[H8111]] Indeed, [[H2009]] they besieged [[H6696]] [the city] [[H5921]] so long that [[H5704]] a donkey’s [[H2543]] head [[H7218]] sold [[H1961]] for eighty [shekels] [[H8084]] of silver, [[H3701]] and a quarter [[H7255]] cab [[H6894]] of dove’s dung [[H2755]] sold for five [shekels] [[H2568]] of silver. [[H3701]]

### 26
As the king [[H4428]] of Israel [[H3478]] was passing by [[H5674]] on [[H5921]] the wall, [[H2346]] a woman [[H802]] cried out [[H6817]] to him, [[H413]] “Help me, [[H3467]] my lord [[H113]] the king!” [[H4428]]

### 27
He answered, [[H559]] “If the LORD [[H3068]] does not [[H408]] help you, [[H3467]] where [[H370]] can I find help for you? [[H3467]] From [[H4480]] the threshing floor [[H1637]] or [[H176]] the winepress?” [[H3342]]

### 28
Then the king [[H4428]] asked her, [[H559]] “What is the matter?” [[H4100]] And she answered, [[H559]] “This [[H2063]] woman [[H802]] said [[H559]] to me, [[H413]] ‘Give up [[H5414]] your son, [[H1121]] and we will eat him today, [[H398]] and [[H853]] tomorrow [[H4279]] we will eat [[H398]] my son.’ [[H1121]]

### 29
So we boiled [[H1310]] my son [[H1121]] and ate him, [[H398]] and the next [[H312]] day [[H3117]] I said [[H559]] to her, [[H413]] ‘Give up [[H5414]] your son, [[H1121]] and we will eat him.’ [[H398]] But she has hidden [[H2244]] her son.” [[H1121]]

### 30
When the king [[H4428]] heard [[H8085]] the words [[H1697]] of the woman, [[H802]] he tore [[H7167]] his clothes. [[H899]] And as he [[H1931]] passed by [[H5674]] on [[H5921]] the wall, [[H2346]] the people [[H5971]] saw [[H7200]] the sackcloth [[H8242]] under his clothes [[H1004]] next to [[H5921]] his skin. [[H1320]]

### 31
He announced, [[H559]] “May God [[H430]] punish [[H3541]] me,  and ever so [[H3541]] severely, [[H3254]] if [[H518]] the head [[H7218]] of Elisha [[H477]] son [[H1121]] of Shaphat [[H8202]] remains [[H5975]] on his shoulders [[H5921]] through this day!” [[H3117]]

### 32
Now Elisha [[H477]] was sitting [[H3427]] in his house, [[H1004]] and the elders [[H2205]] were sitting [[H3427]] with him. [[H854]] The king sent [[H7971]] a messenger [[H376]] ahead, [[H6440]] but before [[H2962]] [he] [[H4397]] arrived, [[H935]] Elisha [[H1931]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] the elders, [[H2205]] “Do you see [[H7200]] how [[H3588]] this [[H2088]] murderer [[H1121]] has sent [[H7971]] someone to cut off [[H5493]] my head? [[H7218]] Look, [[H7200]] when the messenger [[H4397]] comes, [[H935]] shut [[H5462]] the door [[H1817]] to keep him out. [[H3905]] Is not [[H3808]] the sound [[H6963]] of his masters [[H113]] footsteps [[H7272]] behind him? [[H310]]

### 33
While Elisha was still [[H5750]] speaking [[H1696]] with them, [[H5973]] the messenger [[H4397]] came down [[H3381]] to him. [[H413]] And [the king] said, [[H559]] “This [[H2063]] calamity [is] [[H7451]] from [[H853]] the LORD. [[H3068]] Why [[H4100]] should I wait [[H3176]] for the LORD [[H3068]] any longer?” [[H5750]]
