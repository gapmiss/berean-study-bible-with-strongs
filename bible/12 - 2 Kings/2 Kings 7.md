### 1
Then Elisha [[H477]] said, [[H559]] “Hear [[H8085]] the word [[H1697]] of the LORD! [[H3068]] This is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] says: [[H559]] ‘About this time [[H6256]] tomorrow [[H4279]] at the gate [[H8179]] of Samaria, [[H8111]] a seah [[H5429]] of fine flour [will sell] [[H5560]] for a shekel, [[H8255]] and two seahs [[H5429]] of barley [[H8184]] will sell for a shekel.’” [[H8255]]

### 2
But the officer [[H7991]] on [[H5921]] whose arm [[H3027]] the king [[H4428]] leaned [[H8172]] answered [[H6030]] the man [[H376]] of God, [[H430]] “Look, [[H2009]] even if the LORD [[H3068]] were to make [[H6213]] windows [[H699]] in heaven, [[H8064]] could this [[H2088]] really happen?” [[H1961]] “You will see [it] [[H7200]] with your own eyes,” [[H5869]] replied [Elisha], [[H559]] “but you will not eat [[H398]] any of it.” [[H8033]]

### 3
Now there were four [[H702]] men [[H376]] with leprosy [[H6879]] at the entrance [[H6607]] to the gate, [[H8179]] and they said [[H559]] to [[H413]] one [[H376]] another, [[H7453]] “Why [[H4100]] just sit [[H3427]] here [[H6311]] until [[H5704]] we die? [[H4191]]

### 4
If [[H518]] we say, [[H559]] ‘Let us go into [[H935]] the city,’ [[H5892]] we will die [[H4191]] there [[H8033]] from the famine [[H7458]] in the city; [[H5892]] but if [[H518]] we sit [[H3427]] here, [[H6311]] we will also die. [[H4191]] So come now, [[H6258]] let us go over [[H5307]] to [[H413]] the camp [[H4264]] of the Arameans. [[H758]] If [[H518]] they let us live, [[H2421]] we will live; [[H2421]] if [[H518]] they kill us, [[H4191]] we will die. [[H4191]]

### 5
So they arose [[H6965]] at twilight [[H5399]] and went [[H935]] to [[H413]] the camp [[H4264]] of the Arameans. [[H758]] But when they came [[H935]] to [[H5704]] the outskirts [[H7097]] of the camp, [[H4264]] there was not [[H369]] a man [[H376]] to be found. [[H2009]]

### 6
For the LORD [[H136]] {had caused} the Arameans [[H758]] to hear [[H8085]] the sound [[H6963]] of chariots, [[H7393]] horses, [[H5483]] and a great [[H1419]] army, [[H2428]] so that they said [[H559]] to [[H413]] each [[H376]] other, [[H251]] “Look, [[H2009]] the king [[H4428]] of Israel [[H3478]] must have hired [[H7936]] the kings [[H4428]] of the Hittites [[H2850]] and [[H853]] Egyptians [[H4714]] to attack [[H935]] us. [[H5921]]

### 7
Thus [the Arameans] had arisen [[H6965]] and fled [[H5127]] at twilight, [[H5399]] abandoning [[H5800]] their tents [[H168]] and [[H853]] horses [[H5483]] and [[H853]] donkeys. [[H2543]] The camp was intact, [[H4264]] and they had run [[H5127]] for [[H413]] their lives. [[H5315]]

### 8
When the [[H428]] lepers [[H6879]] reached [[H935]] the edge [[H7097]] of the camp, [[H4264]] they went [[H935]] into [[H413]] a [[H259]] tent [[H168]] to eat [[H398]] and drink. [[H8354]] Then they carried off [[H5375]] the silver, [[H3701]] gold, [[H2091]] and clothing, [[H899]] and went [[H1980]] and hid [them]. [[H2934]] On returning, [[H7725]] they entered [[H935]] another [[H312]] tent, [[H168]] carried off [some items] [[H5375]] from there, [[H8033]] and hid them. [[H2934]]

### 9
Finally, they said [[H559]] to [[H413]] one [[H376]] another, [[H7453]] “We are [[H587]] not [[H3808]] doing [[H6213]] what is right. [[H3651]] Today [[H3117]] is a day [[H3117]] of good news. [[H1309]] If we [[H587]] are silent [[H2814]] and wait [[H2442]] until [[H5704]] morning [[H1242]] light, [[H216]] our sin [[H5771]] will overtake us. [[H4672]] Now, therefore, [[H6258]] let us go [[H935]] and tell [[H5046]] the kings [[H4428]] household. [[H1004]]

### 10
So they went [[H935]] and called out [[H7121]] to [[H413]] the gatekeepers [[H7778]] of the city, [[H5892]] saying, [[H5046]] “We went [[H935]] to [[H413]] the Aramean [[H758]] camp [[H4264]] and no [[H369]] one [was] [[H376]] there— [[H8033]] not a trace— [[H6963]] only [[H518]] tethered [[H631]] horses [[H5483]] and donkeys, [[H2543]] and the tents [[H168]] were intact.” [[H1992]]

### 11
The gatekeepers [[H7778]] shouted the news, [[H7121]] and it was reported [[H5046]] to the king’s [[H4428]] household. [[H1004]]

### 12
So the king [[H4428]] got up [[H6965]] in the night [[H3915]] and said [[H559]] to [[H413]] his servants, [[H5650]] “Let me tell [[H5046]] you  what [[H834]] the Arameans [[H758]] have done to us. [[H6213]] They know [[H3045]] we [[H587]] are starving, [[H7457]] so they have left [[H3318]] the camp [[H4264]] to hide [[H2247]] in the field, [[H7704]] thinking, [[H559]] ‘When [[H3588]] they come out [[H3318]] of [[H4480]] the city, [[H5892]] we will take them [[H8610]] alive [[H2416]] and enter [[H935]] the city. [[H5892]]

### 13
But one [[H259]] of [[H4480]] his servants [[H5650]] replied, [[H6030]] “Please, [[H4994]] have [scouts] take [[H3947]] five [[H2568]] of the horses [[H5483]] that [[H834]] remain [[H7604]] in the city.  Their plight [[H2009]] will be no worse than all [[H3605]] the Israelites [[H3478]] who [[H834]] are left [[H7604]] here.  You can see [[H2005]] that [[H3605]] all the Israelites [[H3478]] here [[H834]] are doomed. [[H8552]] So let us send them [[H7971]] and find out. [[H7200]]

### 14
Then [the scouts] took [[H3947]] two [[H8147]] chariots [[H7393]] with horses, [[H5483]] and the king [[H4428]] sent [[H7971]] them after [[H310]] the Aramean [[H758]] army, [[H4264]] saying, [[H559]] “Go [[H1980]] and see.” [[H7200]]

### 15
And they tracked [[H1980]] them as [[H5704]] far as the Jordan, [[H3383]] and indeed, [[H2009]] the whole [[H3605]] way [[H1870]] was littered with [[H4392]] the clothing [[H899]] and equipment [[H3627]] the Arameans [[H758]] had thrown off [[H7993]] in haste. [[H2648]] So the scouts [[H4397]] returned [[H7725]] and told [[H5046]] the king. [[H4428]]

### 16
Then the people [[H5971]] went out [[H3318]] and plundered [[H962]] the camp [[H4264]] of the Arameans. [[H758]] It was then that [[H1961]] a seah [[H5429]] of fine flour [[H5560]] [sold] for a shekel, [[H8255]] and two seahs [[H5429]] of barley [[H8184]] [sold] for a shekel, [[H8255]] according to the word [[H1697]] of the LORD. [[H3068]]

### 17
Now the king [[H4428]] had appointed [[H6485]] the officer [[H7991]] on [[H5921]] whose arm [[H3027]] he leaned [[H8172]] to be in charge of [[H5921]] the gate, [[H8179]] but the people [[H5971]] trampled him [[H7429]] in the gateway, [[H8179]] and he died, [[H4191]] just as [[H834]] the man [[H376]] of God [[H430]] had foretold [[H1696]] when the king [[H4428]] had come [[H3381]] to him. [[H413]]

### 18
It happened [[H1961]] just as the man [[H376]] of God [[H430]] had told [[H1696]] the king: [[H4428]] “About this time [[H6256]] tomorrow [[H4279]] at the gate [[H8179]] of Samaria, [[H8111]] two seahs [[H5429]] of barley [[H8184]] will sell for a shekel, [[H8255]] and a seah [[H5429]] of fine flour [[H5560]] will sell [[H1961]] for a shekel.” [[H8255]]

### 19
And the officer [[H7991]] had answered [[H6030]] the man [[H376]] of God, [[H430]] “Look, [[H2009]] even if the LORD [[H3068]] were to make [[H6213]] windows [[H699]] in heaven, [[H8064]] could this [[H2088]] really happen?” [[H1961]] So Elisha had replied, [[H559]] “You will see [it] [[H7200]] with your own eyes, [[H5869]] but you will not [[H3808]] eat [[H398]] any of it.” [[H8033]]

### 20
And this [[H3651]] is just what happened [[H1961]] to him.  The people [[H5971]] trampled [[H7429]] him in the gateway, [[H8179]] and he died. [[H4191]]
