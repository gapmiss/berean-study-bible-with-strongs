### 1
In the second [[H8147]] year [[H8141]] of the reign [[H4428]] of Jehoash [[H3101]] son [[H1121]] of Jehoahaz [[H3099]] over Israel, [[H3478]] Amaziah [[H558]] son [[H1121]] of Joash [[H3101]] became king [[H4427]] of Judah. [[H3063]]

### 2
He was [[H1961]] twenty-five [[H6242]] years old [[H1121]] when he became king, [[H4427]] and he reigned [[H4427]] in Jerusalem [[H3389]] twenty-nine [[H6242]] years. [[H8141]] His mother’s [[H517]] name [[H8034]] was Jehoaddan; [[H3086]] she was from [[H4480]] Jerusalem. [[H3389]]

### 3
And he did [[H6213]] [what was] right [[H3477]] in the eyes [[H5869]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] but [[H7535]] not [[H3808]] as his father [[H1]] David {had done}. [[H1732]] He did [[H6213]] everything [[H3605]] as [[H834]] his father [[H1]] Joash [[H3101]] had done. [[H6213]]

### 4
Nevertheless, [[H7535]] the high places [[H1116]] were not [[H3808]] taken away, [[H5493]] and the people [[H5971]] continued [[H5750]] sacrificing [[H2076]] and burning incense [[H6999]] on the high places. [[H1116]]

### 5
As soon as [[H834]] the kingdom [[H4467]] was firmly [[H2388]] in his grasp, [[H3027]] Amaziah executed [[H5221]] the servants [[H5650]] who had murdered [[H5221]] his father [[H1]] the king. [[H4428]]

### 6
Yet [[H853]] he did not [[H3808]] put the sons [[H1121]] of the murderers [[H5221]] to death, [[H4191]] according to what is written [[H3789]] in the Book [[H5612]] of the Law [[H8451]] of Moses, [[H4872]] where [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] commanded: [[H6680]] “Fathers [[H1]] must not [[H3808]] be put to death [[H4191]] for [[H5921]] their children, [[H1121]] and children [[H1121]] must not [[H3808]] be put to death [[H4191]] for [[H5921]] their fathers; [[H1]] each [[H376]] is to die [[H4191]] for his own sin. [[H2399]]

### 7
Amaziah [[H1931]] struck down [[H5221]] ten [[H6235]] thousand [[H505]] Edomites [[H123]] in the Valley of Salt. [[H1516]] He took [[H8610]] Sela [[H5554]] in battle [[H4421]] and called [[H7121]] it Joktheel, [[H3371]] its name [[H8034]] to [[H5704]] this very [[H2088]] day. [[H3117]]

### 8
Then [[H227]] Amaziah [[H558]] sent [[H7971]] messengers [[H4397]] to [[H413]] the king [[H4428]] of Israel, [[H3478]] Jehoash [[H3060]] son [[H1121]] of Jehoahaz, [[H3059]] the son [[H1121]] of Jehu. [[H3058]] “Come, [[H1980]] let us meet [[H7200]] face to face,” [[H6440]] he said. [[H559]]

### 9
But Jehoash [[H3060]] king [[H4428]] of Israel [[H3478]] replied [[H7971]] to [[H413]] Amaziah [[H558]] king [[H4428]] of Judah: [[H3063]] “A thistle [[H2336]] in Lebanon [[H3844]] sent [[H7971]] a message to [[H413]] a cedar [[H730]] in Lebanon, [[H3844]] saying, [[H559]] ‘Give [[H5414]] your daughter [[H1323]] to my son [[H1121]] in marriage.’ [[H802]] Then a wild [[H7704]] beast [[H2416]] in Lebanon [[H3844]] came along [[H5674]] and trampled [[H7429]] the thistle. [[H2336]]

### 10
You have indeed defeated [[H5221]] Edom, [[H123]] and your heart [[H3820]] has become proud. [[H5375]] Glory [in that] [[H3513]] and stay [[H3427]] at home. [[H1004]] Why [[H4100]] should you stir up [[H1624]] trouble [[H7451]] so that you fall— [[H5307]] you [[H859]] and Judah [[H3063]] with you?” [[H5973]]

### 11
But Amaziah [[H558]] would not [[H3808]] listen, [[H8085]] and Jehoash [[H3060]] king [[H4428]] of Israel [[H3478]] advanced. [[H5927]] He [[H1931]] and King [[H4428]] Amaziah [[H558]] of Judah [[H3063]] faced off [[H7200]] at Beth-shemesh [[H1053]] in Judah. [[H3063]]

### 12
And Judah [[H3063]] was routed [[H5062]] before [[H6440]] Israel, [[H3478]] and every man [[H376]] fled [[H5127]] to his home. [[H168]]

### 13
There at Beth-shemesh, [[H1053]] Jehoash [[H3060]] king [[H4428]] of Israel [[H3478]] captured [[H8610]] Amaziah [[H558]] king [[H4428]] of Judah, [[H3063]] the son [[H1121]] of Joash, [[H3060]] the son [[H1121]] of Ahaziah. [[H274]] Then Jehoash went [[H935]] to Jerusalem [[H3389]] and broke down [[H6555]] the wall [[H2346]] of Jerusalem [[H3389]] from the Ephraim [[H669]] Gate [[H8179]] to [[H5704]] the Corner [[H6438]] Gate [[H8179]] [a section of] four [[H702]] hundred [[H3967]] cubits. [[H520]]

### 14
He took [[H3947]] all [[H3605]] the gold [[H2091]] and silver [[H3701]] and [[H853]] all [[H3605]] the articles [[H3627]] found [[H4672]] in the house [[H1004]] of the LORD [[H3069]] and in the treasuries [[H214]] of the royal [[H4428]] palace, [[H1004]] as well as some hostages. [[H1121]] Then he returned [[H7725]] to Samaria. [[H8111]]

### 15
As for the rest [[H3499]] of the acts [[H1697]] of Jehoash, [[H3060]] along with his accomplishments, [[H834]] his might, [[H1369]] and how [[H834]] he waged war [[H3898]] against [[H5973]] Amaziah [[H558]] king [[H4428]] of Judah, [[H3063]] are they not written [[H3789]] in the Book [[H5612]] of the Chronicles [[H1697]] of the Kings [[H4428]] of Israel? [[H3478]]

### 16
And Jehoash [[H3060]] rested [[H7901]] with [[H5973]] his fathers, [[H1]] and he was buried [[H6912]] in Samaria [[H8111]] with [[H5973]] the kings [[H4428]] of Israel. [[H3478]] And his son [[H1121]] Jeroboam [[H3379]] became king [[H4427]] in his place. [[H8478]]

### 17
Amaziah [[H558]] son [[H1121]] of Joash [[H3101]] king [[H4428]] of Judah [[H3063]] lived [[H2421]] for fifteen [[H2568]] years [[H8141]] after [[H310]] the death [[H4194]] of Joash [[H3060]] son [[H1121]] of Jehoahaz [[H3059]] king [[H4428]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

### 18
As for the rest [[H3499]] of the acts [[H1697]] of Amaziah, [[H558]] are they not [[H3808]] written [[H3789]] in the Book [[H5612]] of the Chronicles [[H1697]] of the Kings [[H4428]] of Judah? [[H3063]]

### 19
And conspirators [[H7195]] plotted [[H7194]] against {Amaziah] [[H5921]] in Jerusalem, [[H3389]] and he fled [[H5127]] to Lachish. [[H3923]] But men were sent [[H7971]] after him [[H310]] to Lachish, [[H3923]] and they killed him [[H4191]] there. [[H8033]]

### 20
They carried him back [[H5375]] on [[H5921]] horses [[H5483]] and buried him [[H6912]] in Jerusalem [[H3389]] with [[H5973]] his fathers [[H1]] in the City [[H5892]] of David. [[H1732]]

### 21
Then all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] of Judah [[H3063]] took [[H3947]] Azariah, [[H5838]] who [[H1931]] [was] sixteen [[H8337]] years old, [[H1121]] and made him king [[H4427]] in place of [[H8478]] his father [[H1]] Amaziah. [[H558]]

### 22
[Azariah was the one] [[H1931]] who rebuilt [[H1129]] Elath [[H359]] and restored it [[H7725]] to Judah [[H3063]] after [[H310]] King [Amaziah] [[H4428]] rested [[H7901]] with [[H5973]] his fathers. [[H1]]

### 23
In the fifteenth [[H2568]] year [[H8141]] of the reign [[H4428]] of Amaziah [[H558]] son [[H1121]] of Joash [[H3101]] over Judah, [[H3063]] Jeroboam [[H3379]] son [[H1121]] of Jehoash [[H3101]] became king [[H4427]] of Israel, [[H3478]] [and he reigned] in Samaria [[H8111]] forty-one [[H705]] years. [[H8141]]

### 24
And he did [[H6213]] evil [[H7451]] in the sight [[H5869]] of the LORD [[H3068]] and did not [[H3808]] turn away [[H5493]] from all [[H3605]] the sins that [[H2403]] Jeroboam [[H3379]] son [[H1121]] of Nebat [[H5028]] had caused Israel [[H3478]] to commit. [[H2398]]

### 25
[This Jeroboam] [[H1931]] restored [[H7725]] the boundary [[H1366]] of Israel [[H3478]] from Lebo-hamath [[H2574]] to [[H5704]] the Sea [[H3220]] of the Arabah, [[H6160]] according to the word [[H1697]] the LORD, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] had spoken [[H1696]] through [[H3027]] His servant [[H5650]] Jonah [[H3124]] son [[H1121]] of Amittai, [[H573]] the prophet [[H5030]] from Gath-hepher. [[H1662]]

### 26
For [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] saw [[H7200]] that the affliction [[H6040]] of the Israelites, [[H3478]] both slave [[H6113]] [and] [[H657]] free, [[H5800]] was very [[H3966]] bitter. [[H4784]] There was no [[H369]] one to help [[H5826]] Israel, [[H3478]]

### 27
and since the LORD [[H3068]] had said [[H1696]] that He would not blot out [[H4229]] the name [[H8034]] of Israel [[H3478]] from under [[H8478]] heaven, [[H8064]] He delivered [[H3467]] them by the hand [[H3027]] of Jeroboam [[H3379]] son [[H1121]] of Jehoash. [[H3101]]

### 28
As for the rest [[H3499]] of the acts [[H1697]] of Jeroboam, [[H3379]] along with all [[H3605]] his accomplishments [[H834]] and might, [[H1369]] and how [[H834]] he waged war [[H3898]] and recovered [[H7725]] both Damascus [[H1834]] and Hamath [[H2574]] for Israel [[H3478]] from Judah, [[H3063]] are they not written [[H3789]] in the Book [[H5612]] of the Chronicles [[H1697]] of the Kings [[H4428]] of Israel? [[H3478]]

### 29
And Jeroboam [[H3379]] rested [[H7901]] with [[H5973]] his fathers, [[H1]] the kings [[H4428]] of Israel. [[H3478]] And his son [[H1121]] Zechariah [[H2148]] became king [[H4427]] in his place. [[H8478]]
