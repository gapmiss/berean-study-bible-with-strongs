###### 1
In the seventh [[H7651]] year [[H8141]] of Jehu, [[H3058]] Joash [[H3060]] became king, [[H4427]] and he reigned [[H4427]] in Jerusalem [[H3389]] forty [[H705]] years. [[H8141]] His mother’s [[H517]] name [[H8034]] was Zibiah; [[H6645]] she was from  Beersheba. [[H884]]

###### 2
And Joash [[H3060]] did [[H6213]] [what was] right [[H3477]] in the eyes [[H5869]] of the LORD [[H3068]] all [[H3605]] the days [[H3117]] he was instructed [[H3384]] by Jehoiada [[H3077]] the priest. [[H3548]]

###### 3
Nevertheless, [[H7535]] the high places [[H1116]] were not [[H3808]] removed; [[H5493]] the people [[H5971]] continued [[H5750]] sacrificing [[H2076]] and burning incense [[H6999]] [there]. [[H1116]]

###### 4
Then Joash [[H3060]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] the priests, [[H3548]] “[Collect] all [[H3605]] the money [[H3701]] brought [[H935]] as sacred gifts [[H6944]] into the house [[H1004]] of the LORD— [[H3068]] the census [[H5674]] money, [[H3701]] the money [[H3701]] from vows, [[H5315]] [and] [[H3605]] the money [[H3701]] brought [[H935]] voluntarily [[H5927]] into the house [[H1004]] of the LORD. [[H3068]]

###### 5
Let every [[H376]] priest [[H3548]] receive [it] [[H3947]] from his constituency, [[H4378]] and let it be used [[H1992]] to repair [[H2388]] any damage [[H919]] found [[H4672]] in the temple.” [[H1004]]

###### 6
But [[H1961]] by the twenty-third [[H6242]] year [[H8141]] of the reign [[H4428]] of Joash, [[H3060]] the priests [[H3548]] had not [[H3808]] repaired [[H2388]] the damage [[H919]] to the temple. [[H1004]]

###### 7
So King [[H4428]] Joash [[H3060]] called [[H7121]] Jehoiada [[H3077]] and the other priests [[H3548]] and said, [[H559]] “Why [[H4069]] have you not [[H369]] repaired [[H2388]] the damage [[H919]] in the temple? [[H1004]] Now, therefore, [[H6258]] take [[H3947]] no more [[H408]] money [[H3701]] from [[H853]] your constituency, [[H4378]] but [[H3588]] hand it over [[H5414]] for the repair [[H919]] of the temple. [[H1004]]

###### 8
So the priests [[H3548]] agreed [[H225]] they would not [[H1115]] receive [[H3947]] money [[H3701]] from [[H853]] the people [[H5971]] and that they would not [[H1115]] repair [[H2388]] the temple {themselves}. [[H1004]]

###### 9
Then Jehoiada [[H3077]] the priest [[H3548]] took [[H3947]] a [[H259]] chest, [[H727]] bored [[H5344]] a hole [[H2356]] in its lid, [[H1817]] and set [[H5414]] it beside [[H681]] the altar [[H4196]] on the right side [[H3225]] as one [[H376]] enters [[H935]] the house [[H1004]] of the LORD. [[H3068]] There [[H8033]] the priests [[H3548]] who guarded [[H8104]] the threshold [[H5592]] put [[H5414]] all [[H3605]] the money [[H3701]] brought [[H935]] into the house [[H1004]] of the LORD. [[H3068]]

###### 10
Whenever they saw [[H7200]] that [[H3588]] [there was] a large amount [[H7227]] of money [[H3701]] in the chest, [[H727]] the royal [[H4428]] scribe [[H5608]] and the high [[H1419]] priest [[H3548]] would go up, [[H5927]] count [[H4487]] the money [[H3701]] brought [[H4672]] into the house [[H1004]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] and tie it up in bags. [[H6696]]

###### 11
Then they would put [[H5414]] the counted [[H8505]] money [[H3701]] into [[H5921]] the hands [[H3027]] of those who [[H6213]] supervised [[H6485]] the work [[H4399]] on the house [[H1004]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] who in turn would pay [[H3318]] those doing the work— [[H6213]] the carpenters, [[H2796]] builders, [[H1129]]

###### 12
masons, [[H1443]] and stonecutters. [[H2672]] They also purchased [[H7069]] timber [[H6086]] and dressed [[H4274]] stone [[H68]] to repair [[H2388]] the damage [[H919]] to the house [[H1004]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] and they paid [[H3318]] the other expenses [[H3605]] of the temple [[H1004]] repairs. [[H2394]]

###### 13
However, [[H389]] the money [[H3701]] brought [[H935]] into the house [[H1004]] of the LORD [[H3068]] was not [used for] [[H3808]] making [[H6213]] silver [[H3701]] basins, [[H5592]] wick trimmers, [[H4212]] sprinkling bowls, [[H4219]] trumpets, [[H2689]] or any [[H3605]] articles [[H3627]] of gold [[H2091]] or silver [[H3701]] for the house [[H1004]] of the LORD. [[H3068]]

###### 14
Instead, [[H3588]] it was paid [[H5414]] to those doing [[H6213]] the work, [[H4399]] and with it  they repaired [[H2388]] the house [[H1004]] of the LORD. [[H3068]]

###### 15
No [[H3808]] accounting was required [[H2803]] from the men [[H582]] who [[H834]] received the money [[H3701]] to pay [[H5414]] the workmen, [[H6213]] because [[H3588]] they [[H1992]] acted [[H6213]] with fidelity. [[H530]]

###### 16
The money [[H3701]] from the guilt offerings [[H817]] and sin offerings [[H2399]] was not [[H3808]] brought [[H935]] into the house [[H1004]] of the LORD; [[H3068]] it belonged to [[H1961]] the priests. [[H3548]]

###### 17
At that time [[H227]] Hazael [[H2371]] king [[H4428]] of Aram [[H758]] marched up [[H5927]] and fought [[H3898]] against [[H5921]] Gath [[H1661]] and captured it. [[H3920]] Then he [[H2371]] decided [[H7760]] to attack [[H5927]] Jerusalem. [[H3389]]

###### 18
So King [[H4428]] Joash [[H3060]] of Judah [[H3063]] took [[H3947]] all [[H3605]] the sacred objects [[H6944]] dedicated [[H6942]] by his fathers— [[H1]] Jehoshaphat, [[H3092]] Jehoram, [[H3088]] and Ahaziah, [[H274]] the kings [[H4428]] of Judah— [[H3063]] along with [[H853]] his own consecrated items [[H6944]] and all [[H3605]] the gold [[H2091]] found [[H4672]] in the treasuries [[H214]] of the house [[H1004]] of the LORD [[H3068]] and the royal [[H4428]] palace, [[H1004]] and he sent [[H7971]] them to Hazael [[H2371]] king [[H4428]] of Aram. [[H758]] So [Hazael] withdrew [[H5927]] from [[H5921]] Jerusalem. [[H3389]]

###### 19
As for the rest [[H3499]] of the acts [[H1697]] of Joash, [[H3101]] along with all [[H3605]] his accomplishments, [[H834]] are they not written [[H3789]] in the Book [[H5612]] of the Chronicles [[H1697]] of the Kings [[H4428]] of Judah? [[H3063]]

###### 20
And the servants [of Joash] [[H5650]] rose up [[H6965]] and formed [[H7194]] a conspiracy [[H7195]] and killed [[H5221]] [him] [[H3101]] at Beth-millo, [[H4407]] on the road down [[H3381]] to Silla. [[H5538]]

###### 21
His servants [[H5650]] Jozabad [[H3107]] son [[H1121]] of Shimeath [[H8100]] and Jehozabad [[H3075]] son [[H1121]] of Shomer [[H7763]] struck him down, [[H5221]] and he died. [[H4191]] And they buried [[H6912]] him with [[H5973]] his fathers [[H1]] in the City [[H5892]] of David, [[H1732]] and his son [[H1121]] Amaziah [[H558]] became king [[H4427]] in his place. [[H8478]]
