### 1
Now Elisha [[H477]] the prophet [[H5030]] summoned [[H7121]] one [[H259]] of the sons [[H1121]] of the prophets [[H5030]] and said [[H559]] to him,  “Tuck your cloak [[H2296]] under your belt, [[H4975]] take [[H3947]] this [[H2088]] flask [[H6378]] of oil, [[H8081]] and go [[H1980]] to Ramoth-gilead. [[H7433]]

### 2
When you arrive, [[H935]] look [[H7200]] for Jehu [[H3058]] son [[H1121]] of Jehoshaphat, [[H3092]] the son [[H1121]] of Nimshi. [[H5250]] Go in, [[H935]] get him away [[H6965]] from [[H8432]] his companions, [[H251]] and take [[H935]] him to an inner room. [[H2315]]

### 3
Then take [[H3947]] the flask [[H6378]] of oil, [[H8081]] pour [[H3332]] it on [[H5921]] his head, [[H7218]] and declare, [[H559]] ‘This is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] says: [[H559]] I anoint [[H4886]] you king [[H4428]] over [[H413]] Israel.’ [[H3478]] Then open [[H6605]] the door [[H1817]] and run. [[H5127]] Do not [[H3808]] delay!” [[H2442]]

### 4
So the young [[H5288]] prophet [[H5030]] went [[H1980]] to Ramoth-gilead, [[H7433]]

### 5
and when he arrived, [[H935]] the army [[H2428]] commanders [[H8269]] were sitting [[H3427]] there. [[H2009]] “I have a message [[H1697]] for you, [[H413]] commander,” [[H8269]] he said. [[H559]] “For [[H413]] which [[H4310]] of us?” [[H3605]] asked [[H559]] Jehu. [[H3058]] “For you, [[H413]] commander,” [[H8269]] he replied. [[H559]]

### 6
So Jehu got up [[H6965]] and went [[H935]] into the house, [[H1004]] where the young prophet poured [[H3332]] the oil [[H8081]] on [[H413]] his head [[H7218]] and declared, [[H559]] “This is what [[H3541]] the LORD, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] says: [[H559]] ‘I anoint you [[H4886]] king [[H4428]] over [[H413]] the LORD’s [[H3068]] people [[H5971]] Israel. [[H3478]]

### 7
And you are to strike down [[H5221]] the house [[H1004]] of your master [[H113]] Ahab, [[H256]] so that I may avenge [[H5358]] the blood [[H1818]] of My servants [[H5650]] the prophets [[H5030]] [and] [[H1818]] all [[H3605]] the servants [[H5650]] of the LORD [[H3068]] [shed] by the hand [[H3027]] of Jezebel. [[H348]]

### 8
The whole [[H3605]] house [[H1004]] of Ahab [[H256]] will perish, [[H6]] and I will cut off [[H3772]] from Ahab [[H256]] all the males [[H8366]] in Israel, [[H3478]] both slave [[H6113]] and free. [[H5800]]

### 9
I will make [[H5414]] the house [[H1004]] of Ahab [[H256]] like the houses [[H1004]] of Jeroboam [[H3379]] son [[H1121]] of Nebat [[H5028]] [and] [[H1004]] Baasha [[H1201]] son [[H1121]] of Ahijah. [[H281]]

### 10
And [[H853]] the dogs [[H3611]] will eat [[H398]] Jezebel [[H348]] on the plot [of ground] at [[H2506]] Jezreel, [[H3157]] and [there will be] no one [[H369]] to bury [her].’” [[H6912]] Then the young prophet opened [[H6605]] the door [[H1817]] and ran away. [[H5127]]

### 11
When Jehu [[H3058]] went out [[H3318]] to [[H413]] the servants [[H5650]] of his master, [[H113]] they asked, [[H559]] “Is everything all right? [[H7965]] Why [[H4069]] did this [[H2088]] madman [[H7696]] come [[H935]] to you?” [[H413]] “You [[H859]] know [[H3045]] the sort [[H376]] and their babble,” [[H7879]] he replied. [[H559]]

### 12
“That is a lie!” [[H8267]] they said. [[H559]] “Tell us!” [[H5046]] So Jehu answered, [[H559]] “He talked [[H559]] to me [[H413]] about this [[H2063]] and that, [[H2063]] and he said, [[H559]] ‘This is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] says: [[H559]] I anoint [[H4886]] you king [[H4428]] over [[H413]] Israel.’” [[H3478]]

### 13
Quickly, [[H4116]] each man [[H376]] took [[H3947]] his garment [[H899]] and put [it] [[H7760]] under [Jehu] [[H8478]] on [[H413]] the bare [[H1634]] steps. [[H4609]] Then they blew [[H8628]] the trumpet [[H7782]] and proclaimed, [[H559]] “Jehu [[H3058]] is king!” [[H4427]]

### 14
Thus Jehu [[H3058]] son [[H1121]] of Jehoshaphat, [[H3092]] the son [[H1121]] of Nimshi, [[H5250]] conspired [[H7194]] against [[H413]] Joram. [[H3141]] (Now Joram [[H3141]] and all [[H3605]] Israel [[H3478]] had been [[H1961]] defending [[H8104]] Ramoth-gilead [[H7433]] against [[H6440]] Hazael [[H2371]] king [[H4428]] of Aram, [[H758]]

### 15
but King [[H4428]] Joram [[H3088]] had returned [[H7725]] to Jezreel [[H3157]] to recover [[H7495]] from [[H4480]] the wounds [[H4347]] he had suffered [[H5221]] [at the hands] of the Arameans [[H761]] in the battle [[H3898]] against [[H854]] Hazael [[H2371]] their king.) [[H4428]] So Jehu [[H3058]] said, [[H559]] “If [[H518]] you commanders wish to make me king, [[H5315]] then do not [[H408]] let anyone [[H3318]] escape [[H6412]] from [[H4480]] the city [[H5892]] to go [[H1980]] and tell [it] [[H5046]] in Jezreel. [[H3157]]

### 16
Then Jehu [[H3058]] got into his chariot [[H7392]] and went [[H1980]] to Jezreel, [[H3157]] because [[H3588]] Joram [[H3141]] was laid up [[H7901]] there [[H8033]] and Ahaziah [[H274]] king [[H4428]] of Judah [[H3063]] had gone down [[H3381]] to see [[H7200]] [him]. [[H3141]]

### 17
Now the watchman [[H6822]] standing [[H5975]] on [[H5921]] the tower [[H4026]] in Jezreel [[H3157]] saw [[H7200]] Jehu’s [[H3058]] troops [[H8229]] approaching, [[H935]] and he called out, [[H559]] “I [[H589]] see [[H7200]] a company of [troops]!” [[H8229]] “Choose [[H3947]] a rider,” [[H7395]] Joram [[H3088]] commanded. [[H559]] “Send him out [[H7971]] to meet them [[H7125]] and ask, [[H559]] Have you come in peace?’” [[H7965]]

### 18
So a horseman [[H7392]] rode off [[H1980]] to meet Jehu [[H7125]] and said, [[H559]] “This is what [[H3541]] the king [[H4428]] asks: [[H559]] ‘Have you come in peace?’” [[H7965]] “What [[H4100]] do you  know about peace?” [[H7965]] Jehu [[H3058]] replied. [[H559]] “Fall in [[H5437]] behind me.” [[H310]] And the watchman [[H6822]] reported, [[H5046]] “The messenger [[H4397]] reached [[H935]] them, [[H1992]] but he is not [[H3808]] coming back.” [[H7725]]

### 19
So [the king] sent out [[H7971]] a second [[H8145]] horseman, [[H7392]] who went [[H935]] to them [[H413]] and said, [[H559]] “This is what [[H3541]] the king [[H4428]] asks: [[H559]] ‘Have you come in peace?’” [[H7965]] “What [[H4100]] do you  know about peace?” [[H7965]] Jehu [[H3058]] replied. [[H559]] “Fall in [[H5437]] behind me.” [[H310]]

### 20
Again the watchman [[H6822]] reported, [[H5046]] “He reached [[H935]] them, [[H413]] but he is not [[H3808]] coming back. [[H7725]] And the charioteer [[H4491]] is driving like [[H4491]] Jehu [[H3058]] son [[H1121]] of Nimshi— [[H5250]] he drives [[H5090]] like a madman.” [[H7697]]

### 21
“Harness!” [[H631]] Joram [[H3088]] shouted, [[H559]] and they harnessed [[H631]] his chariot. [[H7393]] Then Joram [[H3088]] king [[H4428]] of Israel [[H3478]] and Ahaziah [[H274]] king [[H4428]] of Judah [[H3063]] set out, [[H3318]] each [[H376]] in his own chariot, [[H7393]] and met [[H3318]] Jehu [[H3058]] on the property [[H2513]] of Naboth [[H5022]] the Jezreelite. [[H3158]]

### 22
When Joram [[H3088]] saw [[H7200]] Jehu, [[H3058]] he asked, [[H559]] “Have you come in peace, [[H7965]] Jehu?” [[H3058]] “How [[H4100]] can there be [[H5704]] peace,” [[H7965]] he replied, [[H559]] “as long as [[H7227]] the idolatry [[H2183]] and witchcraft [[H3785]] of your mother [[H517]] Jezebel abound?” [[H348]]

### 23
Joram [[H3088]] turned around [[H2015]] and fled, [[H5127]] calling out [[H559]] to [[H413]] Ahaziah, [[H274]] “Treachery, [[H4820]] Ahaziah!” [[H274]]

### 24
Then Jehu [[H3058]] drew [[H4390]] his bow [[H7198]] and shot [[H5221]] Joram [[H3088]] between [[H996]] the shoulders. [[H2220]] The arrow [[H2678]] pierced [[H3318]] his heart, [[H3820]] and he slumped down [[H3766]] in his chariot. [[H7393]]

### 25
And [Jehu] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Bidkar [[H920]] his officer, [[H7991]] “Pick him up [[H5375]] [and] throw him [[H7993]] into the field [[H7704]] of Naboth [[H5022]] the Jezreelite. [[H3158]] For [[H3588]] remember that [[H2142]] when you [[H859]] and I [[H589]] were riding [[H7392]] together [[H6776]] behind [[H310]] his father [[H1]] Ahab, [[H256]] the LORD [[H3069]] lifted up [[H5375]] this [[H2088]] oracle [[H4853]] against him: [[H5921]]

### 26
‘As surely [[H518]] as I saw [[H7200]] the blood [[H1818]] of Naboth [[H5022]] and the blood [[H1818]] of his sons [[H1121]] yesterday, [[H570]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD, [[H3068]] so will I repay [[H7999]] you on this [[H2063]] plot of land, [[H2513]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD.’ [[H3068]] Now then, [[H6258]] according to the word [[H1697]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] pick him up [[H5375]] [and] throw him [[H7993]] on the plot [of land].” [[H2513]]

### 27
When King [[H4428]] Ahaziah [[H274]] of Judah [[H3063]] saw [this], [[H7200]] he fled [[H5127]] up the road [[H1870]] toward Beth-haggan. [[H1588]] And Jehu [[H3058]] pursued him, [[H7291]] shouting, [[H559]] “Shoot [[H5221]] him [[H853]] too!” [[H1571]] [So they shot Ahaziah] in [[H413]] his chariot [[H4818]] on the Ascent [[H4608]] of Gur, [[H1483]] near Ibleam, [[H2991]] and he fled [[H5127]] to Megiddo [[H4023]] and died [[H4191]] there. [[H8033]]

### 28
Then his servants [[H5650]] carried him by chariot [[H7392]] to Jerusalem [[H3389]] and buried [[H6912]] him [[H853]] with his fathers [[H1]] in his tomb [[H6900]] in the City [[H5892]] of David. [[H1732]]

### 29
(In the eleventh [[H259]] year [[H8141]] of Joram [[H3141]] son [[H1121]] of Ahab, [[H256]] Ahaziah [[H274]] had become king [[H4427]] over [[H5921]] Judah.) [[H3063]]

### 30
Now when Jehu [[H3058]] arrived [[H935]] in Jezreel, [[H3157]] Jezebel [[H348]] heard [of it]. [[H8085]] So she painted [[H7760]] her eyes, [[H5869]] adorned [[H3190]] her head, [[H7218]] and looked down [[H8259]] from [[H1157]] a window. [[H2474]]

### 31
And as Jehu [[H3058]] entered [[H935]] the gate, [[H8179]] she asked, [[H559]] “Have you come in peace, [[H7965]] O Zimri, [[H2174]] murderer [[H2026]] of your master?” [[H113]]

### 32
He looked up [[H5375]] at [[H413]] the window [[H2474]] and called out, [[H559]] “Who [[H4310]] is on my side? [[H854]] Who?” [[H4310]] And two [[H8147]] or three [[H7969]] eunuchs [[H5631]] looked down [[H8259]] at him. [[H413]]

### 33
“Throw her down!” [[H8058]] yelled [Jehu]. [[H559]] So they threw her down, [[H8058]] and her blood [[H1818]] splattered [[H5137]] on [[H413]] the wall [[H7023]] and on [[H413]] the horses [[H5483]] as they trampled her underfoot. [[H7429]]

### 34
Then [Jehu] went in [[H935]] and ate [[H398]] and drank. [[H8354]] “Take care of [[H6485]] this [[H2063]] cursed [woman],” [[H779]] he said, [[H559]] “and bury her, [[H6912]] for [[H3588]] she [was] [[H1931]] the daughter [[H1323]] of a king.” [[H4428]]

### 35
But when they went out [[H1980]] to bury her, [[H6912]] they found [[H4672]] nothing but [[H3808]] her skull, [[H1538]] her feet, [[H7272]] and the palms [[H3709]] of her hands. [[H3027]]

### 36
So they went back [[H7725]] and told [[H5046]] [Jehu],  who replied, [[H559]] “This [[H1931]] is the word [[H1697]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] which [[H834]] He spoke [[H1696]] through [[H3027]] His servant [[H5650]] Elijah [[H452]] the Tishbite: [[H8664]] ‘On the plot [of land] [[H2506]] at Jezreel [[H3157]] the dogs [[H3611]] will devour [[H398]] Jezebel’s [[H348]] flesh. [[H1320]]

### 37
And Jezebel’s [[H348]] body [[H5038]] will lie [[H1961]] like dung [[H1828]] in the field [[H7704]] in the plot [[H2506]] at Jezreel, [[H3157]] so that [[H834]] no one [[H3808]] can say: [[H559]] This [[H2063]] is Jezebel.’” [[H348]]
