### 1
In those [[H1992]] days [[H3117]] Hezekiah [[H2396]] became mortally [[H4191]] ill. [[H2470]] The prophet [[H5030]] Isaiah [[H3470]] son [[H1121]] of Amoz [[H531]] came [[H935]] to him [[H413]] and said, [[H559]] “This is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] says: [[H559]] ‘Put your house [[H1004]] in order, [[H6680]] for [[H3588]] you [[H859]] are about to die; [[H4191]] you will not [[H3808]] recover. [[H2421]]

### 2
Then Hezekiah turned [[H5437]] his face [[H6440]] to [[H413]] the wall [[H7023]] and prayed [[H6419]] to [[H413]] the LORD, [[H3068]]

### 3
“Please, [[H577]] O LORD, [[H3068]] remember [[H2142]] how [[H834]] I have walked [[H1980]] before You [[H6440]] faithfully [[H571]] and with wholehearted [[H3824]] devotion; [[H8003]] I have done [[H6213]] [what is] good [[H2896]] in Your sight.” [[H5869]] And Hezekiah [[H2396]] wept [[H1058]] bitterly. [[H1419]]

### 4
Before [[H3808]] Isaiah [[H3470]] had left [[H3318]] the middle [[H8484]] courtyard, [[H5892]] the word [[H1697]] of the LORD [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] to him, [[H413]] saying, [[H559]]

### 5
“Go back [[H7725]] and tell [[H559]] Hezekiah, [[H2396]] the leader [[H5057]] of My people, [[H5971]] ‘This is what [[H3541]] the LORD, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of your father [[H1]] David, [[H1732]] says: [[H559]] I have heard [[H8085]] your prayer; [[H8605]] I have seen [[H7200]] your tears. [[H1832]] I will surely heal you. [[H7495]] On the third [[H7992]] day from now [[H3117]] you will go up [[H5927]] to the house [[H1004]] of the LORD. [[H3068]]

### 6
I will add [[H3254]] fifteen [[H2568]] years [[H8141]] to [[H5921]] your life, [[H3117]] and I will deliver you [[H5337]] and [[H853]] this [[H2063]] city [[H5892]] from the hand [[H3709]] of the king [[H4428]] of Assyria. [[H804]] I will defend [[H1598]] this [[H2063]] city [[H5892]] for My sake [[H4616]] and for the sake of [[H4616]] My servant [[H5650]] David.’” [[H1732]]

### 7
Then Isaiah [[H3470]] said, [[H559]] “Prepare [[H3947]] a poultice [[H1690]] of figs.” [[H8384]] So they brought it [[H3947]] and applied [[H7760]] it to [[H5921]] the boil, [[H7822]] and he recovered. [[H2421]]

### 8
Now Hezekiah [[H2396]] had asked [[H559]] Isaiah, [[H3470]] “What [[H4100]] is the sign [[H226]] that [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] will heal [[H7495]] me and that I will go up [[H5927]] to the house [[H1004]] of the LORD [[H3068]] on the third [[H7992]] day?” [[H3117]]

### 9
And Isaiah [[H3470]] replied, [[H559]] “This [[H2088]] will be a sign [[H226]] to you  from [[H853]] the LORD [[H3068]] that [[H3588]] He [[H3068]] will do [[H6213]] what [[H834]] He has promised: [[H1696]] [Would you like] the shadow [[H6738]] to go [[H1980]] forward ten [[H6235]] steps, [[H4609]] or [[H518]] back [[H7725]] ten [[H6235]] steps?” [[H4609]]

### 10
“It is easy [[H7043]] for the shadow [[H6738]] to lengthen [[H5186]] ten [[H6235]] steps,” [[H4609]] answered [[H559]] Hezekiah, [[H2396]] “but not [[H3808]] for it [[H6738]] to go [[H7725]] back [[H322]] ten [[H6235]] steps.” [[H4609]]

### 11
So Isaiah [[H3470]] the prophet [[H5030]] called out [[H7121]] to [[H413]] the LORD, [[H3068]] and He brought [[H7725]] the shadow [[H6738]] back [[H322]] the ten [[H6235]] steps [[H4609]] it had descended [[H3381]] on the stairway [[H4609]] of Ahaz. [[H271]]

### 12
At that [[H1931]] time [[H6256]] Merodach-baladan [[H1255]] son [[H1121]] of Baladan [[H1081]] king [[H4428]] of Babylon [[H894]] sent [[H7971]] letters [[H5612]] and a gift [[H4503]] to [[H413]] Hezekiah, [[H2396]] for [[H3588]] he had heard [[H8085]] about [[H3588]] Hezekiah’s [[H2396]] illness. [[H2470]]

### 13
And Hezekiah [[H2396]] received [[H8085]] the messengers [[H5921]] and showed them [[H7200]] all that was [[H3605]] in his treasure [[H5238]] house— [[H1004]] the silver, [[H3701]] the gold, [[H2091]] the spices, [[H1314]] and the precious [[H2896]] oil— [[H8081]] along with his armory [[H1004]] and everything [[H3605]] that [[H834]] was found [[H4672]] in his storehouses. [[H214]] There was [[H1961]] nothing [[H3808]] in his palace [[H1004]] or in all [[H3605]] his dominion [[H4474]] that [[H834]] Hezekiah [[H2396]] did not [[H3808]] show them. [[H7200]]

### 14
Then the prophet [[H5030]] Isaiah [[H3470]] went [[H935]] to [[H413]] King [[H4428]] Hezekiah [[H2396]] and asked, [[H559]] “From where [[H370]] did those [[H428]] men [[H376]] come, [[H935]] and what [[H4100]] did they say [[H559]] to you?” [[H413]] “They came [[H935]] from a distant [[H7350]] land,” [[H776]] Hezekiah [[H2396]] replied, [[H559]] “from Babylon.” [[H894]]

### 15
“What [[H4100]] have they seen [[H7200]] in your palace?” [[H1004]] Isaiah asked. [[H559]] “They have seen [[H7200]] everything [[H3605]] in my palace,” [[H1004]] answered [[H559]] Hezekiah. [[H2396]] “There is nothing [[H3808]] among my treasures [[H214]] that [[H834]] I did not [[H3808]] show them.” [[H7200]]

### 16
Then Isaiah [[H3470]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Hezekiah, [[H2396]] “Hear [[H8085]] the word [[H1697]] of the LORD: [[H3068]]

### 17
The time [[H3117]] will surely [[H2009]] come [[H935]] when everything [[H3605]] in your palace [[H1004]] and all that [[H834]] your fathers [[H1]] have stored up [[H686]] until [[H5704]] this [[H2088]] day [[H3117]] will be carried off [[H5375]] to Babylon. [[H894]] Nothing [[H3808]] will be left, [[H3498]] says [[H559]] the LORD. [[H3068]]

### 18
And some of [[H4480]] your descendants, [[H1121]] your own [[H834]] flesh and blood, [[H3318]] will be taken away [[H3947]] to be [[H1961]] eunuchs [[H5631]] in the palace [[H1964]] of the king [[H4428]] of Babylon.” [[H894]]

### 19
But Hezekiah [[H2396]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Isaiah, [[H3470]] “The word [[H1697]] of the LORD [[H3068]] that [[H834]] you have spoken [[H1696]] is good.” [[H2896]] For he thought, [[H559]] “Will there not [[H3808]] at least [[H518]] be [[H1961]] peace [[H7965]] and security [[H571]] in my lifetime?” [[H3117]]

### 20
As for the rest [[H3499]] of the acts [[H1697]] of Hezekiah, [[H2396]] along with all [[H3605]] his might [[H1369]] and how [[H834]] he constructed [[H6213]] the pool [[H1295]] and the tunnel [[H8585]] to bring [[H935]] water [[H4325]] into the city, [[H5892]] are they not written [[H3789]] in the Book [[H5612]] of the Chronicles [[H1697]] of the Kings [[H4428]] of Judah? [[H3063]]

### 21
And Hezekiah [[H2396]] rested [[H7901]] with [[H5973]] his fathers, [[H1]] and his son [[H1121]] Manasseh [[H4519]] became king [[H4427]] in his place. [[H8478]]
