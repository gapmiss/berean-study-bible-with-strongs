###### 1
Therefore, [[G3767]] since [[G1487]] you have been raised with [[G4891]] Christ, [[G5547]] strive for [[G2212]] the things [[G3588]] above, [[G507]] where [[G3757]] Christ [[G5547]] is [[G1510]] seated [[G2521]] at [[G1722]] [the] right hand [[G1188]] of God. [[G2316]]

###### 2
Set [your] minds on [[G5426]] things [[G3588]] above, [[G507]] not [[G3361]] on [[G1909]] earthly [[G1093]] things. [[G3588]]

###### 3
For [[G1063]] you died, [[G599]] and [[G2532]] your [[G4771]] life [[G2222]] is now hidden [[G2928]] with [[G4862]] Christ [[G5547]] in [[G1722]] God. [[G2316]]

###### 4
When [[G3752]] Christ, [[G5547]] who is [[G3588]] your [[G4771]] life, [[G2222]] appears, [[G5319]] then [[G5119]] you [[G4771]] also [[G2532]] will appear [[G5319]] with [[G4862]] Him [[G846]] in [[G1722]] glory. [[G1391]]

###### 5
Put to death, [[G3499]] therefore, [[G3767]] the [[G3588]] components [[G3196]] of your [[G3588]] earthly nature: [[G1093]] sexual immorality, [[G4202]] impurity, [[G167]] lust, [[G3806]] evil [[G2556]] desires, [[G1939]] and [[G2532]] greed, [[G4124]] which [[G3748]] is [[G1510]] idolatry. [[G1495]]

###### 6
Because of [[G1223]] these, [[G3739]] the [[G3588]] wrath [[G3709]] of God [[G2316]] is coming [[G2064]] on [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] sons [[G5207]] of [[G3588]] disobedience. [[G543]]

###### 7
When [[G3753]] you lived [[G2198]] among [[G1722]] them, [[G3778]] you [[G4771]] also [[G2532]] used to [[G4218]] walk [[G4043]] in [[G1722]] these ways. [[G3739]]

###### 8
But [[G1161]] now [[G3570]] you [[G4771]] must put aside [[G659]] all such things as these: [[G3956]] anger, [[G3709]] rage, [[G2372]] malice, [[G2549]] slander, [[G988]] [and] filthy language [[G148]] from [[G1537]] your [[G4771]] mouth. [[G4750]]

###### 9
{Do} not [[G3361]] lie [[G5574]] to [[G1519]] one another, [[G240]] since you have taken off [[G554]] the [[G3588]] old [[G3820]] self [[G444]] with [[G4862]] [its] [[G846]] practices, [[G4234]]

###### 10
and [[G2532]] have put on [[G1746]] the [[G3588]] new [self], [[G3501]] which is [[G3588]] being renewed [[G341]] in [[G1519]] knowledge [[G1922]] in [[G2596]] [the] image [[G1504]] of [[G3588]] [its] [[G846]] Creator. [[G2936]]

###### 11
Here [[G3699]] there is [[G1762]] no [[G3756]] Greek [[G1672]] [or] [[G2532]] Jew, [[G2453]] circumcised [[G4061]] [or] [[G2532]] uncircumcised, [[G203]] barbarian, [[G915]] Scythian, [[G4658]] slave, [[G1401]] [or] free, [[G1658]] but [[G235]] Christ [is] [[G5547]] all [[G3956]] and [[G2532]] [is] in [[G1722]] all. [[G3956]]

###### 12
Therefore, [[G3767]] as [[G5613]] [the] elect [[G1588]] of God, [[G2316]] holy [[G40]] and [[G2532]] beloved, [[G25]] clothe yourselves with [[G1746]] compassion, [[G3628]] kindness, [[G5544]] humility, [[G5012]] gentleness, [[G4240]] [and] patience. [[G3115]]

###### 13
Bear with [[G430]] each other [[G240]] and [[G2532]] forgive [[G5483]] [any] [[G5100]] complaint [[G3437]] you may have [[G2192]] against [[G4314]] one another. [[G5100]] Forgive [[G4771]] as [[G2531]] the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] forgave [[G5483]] you. [[G4771]]

###### 14
And [[G1161]] over [[G1909]] all [[G3956]] these [virtues] [[G3778]] [put on] love, [[G26]] which [[G3739]] is [[G1510]] [the] bond [[G4886]] of perfect unity. [[G5047]]

###### 15
{Let] the [[G3588]] peace [[G1515]] of Christ [[G5547]] rule [[G1018]] in [[G1722]] your [[G4771]] hearts, [[G2588]] [for] to [[G1519]] this [[G3739]] you were called [[G2564]] as members of [[G1722]] one [[G1520]] body. [[G4983]] And [[G2532]] be [[G1096]] thankful. [[G2170]]

###### 16
{Let} the [[G3588]] word [[G3056]] of Christ [[G5547]] richly [[G4146]] dwell [[G1774]] within [[G1722]] you [[G4771]] as you teach [[G1321]] and [[G2532]] admonish [[G3560]] one another [[G1438]] with [[G1722]] all [[G3956]] wisdom, [[G4678]] [and] as you sing [[G103]] psalms, [[G5568]] hymns, [[G5215]] [and] spiritual [[G4152]] songs [[G5603]] with [[G1722]] gratitude [[G5485]] in [[G1722]] your [[G4771]] hearts [[G2588]] to [[G3588]] God. [[G2316]]

###### 17
And [[G2532]] whatever [[G3956]] you do, [[G4160]] in [[G1722]] word [[G3056]] or [[G2228]] deed, [[G2041]] [do it] all [[G3956]] in [[G1722]] [the] name [[G3686]] of [the] Lord [[G2962]] Jesus, [[G2424]] giving thanks [[G2168]] to God [[G2316]] [the] Father [[G3962]] through [[G1223]] Him. [[G846]]

###### 18
Wives, [[G1135]] submit [[G5293]] to [your] [[G3588]] husbands, [[G435]] as [[G5613]] is fitting [[G433]] in [[G1722]] [the] Lord. [[G2962]]

###### 19
Husbands, [[G435]] love [[G25]] [your] [[G3588]] wives [[G1135]] and [[G2532]] {do} not [[G3361]] be harsh [[G4087]] with [[G4314]] them. [[G846]]

###### 20
Children, [[G5043]] obey [[G5219]] [your] [[G3588]] parents [[G1118]] in [[G2596]] everything, [[G3956]] for [[G1063]] this [[G3778]] is [[G1510]] pleasing [[G2101]] to [[G1722]] [the] Lord. [[G2962]]

###### 21
Fathers, [[G3962]] {do} not [[G3361]] provoke [[G2042]] your [[G4771]] children, [[G5043]] so [[G2443]] they will not become discouraged. [[G120]]

###### 22
Slaves, [[G1401]] obey [[G5219]] [your] [[G3588]] earthly [[G2596]] masters [[G2962]] in [[G2596]] everything, [[G3956]] not [only] [[G3361]] to please them [[G441]] while they are watching, [[G3787]] but [[G235]] with [[G1722]] sincerity [[G572]] of heart [[G2588]] [and] fear [[G5399]] of the [[G3588]] Lord. [[G2962]]

###### 23
Whatever [[G3739]] you do, [[G4160]] work at it [[G2038]] with your whole being, [[G5590]] for [[G5613]] the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] and [[G2532]] not [[G3756]] for men, [[G444]]

###### 24
because you know [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] you will receive [[G618]] an inheritance [[G2817]] from [[G575]] [the] Lord [[G2962]] [as your] [[G3588]] reward. [[G469]] [It is] the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] Christ [[G5547]] you are serving. [[G1398]]

###### 25
Whoever [[G3588]] does wrong [[G91]] will be repaid [for] [[G2865]] his wrong, [[G91]] and [[G2532]] there is [[G1510]] no [[G3756]] favoritism. [[G4382]]
