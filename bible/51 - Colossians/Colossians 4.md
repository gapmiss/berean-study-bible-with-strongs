###### 1
Masters, [[G2962]] supply [[G3930]] [your] [[G3588]] slaves [[G1401]] with what [[G3588]] [is] right [[G1342]] and [[G2532]] fair, [[G2471]] since you know [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] you [[G4771]] also [[G2532]] have [[G2192]] a Master [[G2962]] in [[G1722]] heaven. [[G3772]]

###### 2
Devote yourselves [[G4342]] to [[G3588]] prayer, [[G4335]] being watchful [[G1127]] [and] [[G1722]] thankful, [[G2169]]

###### 3
as [[G260]] you pray [[G4336]] also [[G2532]] for [[G4012]] us, [[G1473]] that [[G2443]] God [[G2316]] may open [[G455]] to us [[G1473]] a door [[G2374]] for the [[G3588]] word, [[G3056]] so that we may proclaim [[G2980]] the [[G3588]] mystery [[G3466]] of Christ, [[G5547]] for [[G1223]] which [[G3739]] I am in chains. [[G1210]]

###### 4
[Pray] that [[G2443]] I may declare it clearly, [[G5319]] as [[G5613]] I [[G1473]] should. [[G1163]]

###### 5
Act [[G4043]] wisely [[G4678]] toward [[G4314]] outsiders, [[G1854]] redeeming [[G1805]] the [[G3588]] time. [[G2540]]

###### 6
[Let] your [[G4771]] speech [[G3056]] always [be] [[G3842]] gracious, [[G5485]] seasoned [[G741]] with salt, [[G217]] so that you may know [[G1492]] how [[G4459]] to answer [[G611]] everyone. [[G1538]]

###### 7
Tychicus [[G5190]] will tell [[G1107]] you [[G4771]] all [[G3956]] the news [[G3588]] about [[G2596]] me. [[G1473]] [He is] [[G3588]] a beloved [[G27]] brother, [[G80]] a faithful [[G4103]] minister, [[G1249]] and [[G2532]] a fellow servant [[G4889]] in [[G1722]] [the] Lord. [[G2962]]

###### 8
I have sent [[G3992]] him [[G3739]] to [[G4314]] you [[G4771]] for [[G1519]] this very [[G846]] purpose, [[G3778]] that [[G2443]] you may know [[G1097]] about [[G4012]] us, [[G1473]] and that [[G2532]] he may encourage [[G3870]] your [[G4771]] hearts. [[G2588]]

###### 9
With him [I am sending] [[G4862]] Onesimus, [[G3682]] [our] [[G3588]] faithful [[G4103]] and [[G2532]] beloved [[G27]] brother, [[G80]] who [[G3739]] is [[G1510]] [one] of [[G1537]] you. [[G4771]] They will tell [[G1107]] you {about} [[G4771]] everything [[G3956]] here. [[G5602]]

###### 10
My [[G1473]] fellow prisoner [[G4869]] Aristarchus [[G708]] sends you greetings, [[G782]] as does [[G2532]] Mark [[G3138]] the [[G3588]] cousin [[G431]] of Barnabas. [[G921]] You have [already] received [[G2983]] instructions [[G1785]] about [[G4012]] [him]: [[G3739]] If [[G1437]] he comes [[G2064]] to [[G4314]] you, [[G4771]] welcome [[G1209]] him. [[G846]]

###### 11
Jesus, [[G2424]] who is called [[G3004]] Justus, [[G2459]] also [sends greetings]. [[G2532]] These [[G3778]] are [[G1510]] [the] only [[G3441]] Jews [[G4061]] among [[G1537]] [my] [[G3588]] fellow workers [[G4904]] for [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] of God, [[G2316]] [and] they [[G3748]] have been [[G1096]] a comfort [[G3931]] to me. [[G1473]]

###### 12
Epaphras, [[G1889]] who [is] [[G3588]] [one] of [[G1537]] you [[G4771]] [and] a servant [[G1401]] of Christ [[G5547]] Jesus, [[G2424]] sends you greetings. [[G782]] [He is] always [[G3842]] wrestling [[G75]] in [[G1722]] prayer [[G4335]] for [[G5228]] you, [[G4771]] so that [[G2443]] you may stand [[G2476]] mature [[G5046]] and [[G2532]] fully assured [[G4135]] in [[G1722]] [the] full [[G3956]] will [[G2307]] of God. [[G2316]]

###### 13
For [[G1063]] I testify [[G3140]] about him [[G846]] that [[G3754]] he goes to [[G2192]] great [[G4183]] pains [[G4192]] for [[G5228]] you [[G4771]] and [[G2532]] for those [[G3588]] at [[G1722]] Laodicea [[G2993]] and [[G2532]] Hierapolis. [[G2413]]

Greet [[G782]] the [[G3588]] brothers [[G80]] in [[G1722]] Laodicea, [[G2993]] as well as [[G2532]] Nympha [[G3564]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] church [[G1577]] [that meets] at [[G2596]] her [[G846]] house. [[G3624]]

###### 16
After [[G3752]] [this] [[G3588]] letter [[G1992]] has been read [[G314]] among [[G3844]] you, [[G4771]] make sure [[G4160]] that [[G2443]] it is also read [[G314]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] church [[G1577]] of [the] Laodiceans, [[G2994]] and [[G2532]] that [[G2443]] you [[G4771]] in turn [[G2532]] read [[G314]] the [letter] [[G3588]] from [[G1537]] Laodicea. [[G2993]]

###### 17
Tell [[G2036]] Archippus: [[G751]] “See to it [[G991]] that [[G2443]] you complete [[G4137]] the [[G3588]] ministry [[G1248]] you have received [[G3880]] in [[G1722]] [the] Lord.” [[G2962]]

###### 18
This [[G3588]] greeting [[G783]] [is in my] [[G3588]] own [[G1699]] hand— [[G5495]] Paul. [[G3972]] Remember [[G3421]] my [[G1473]] chains. [[G1199]] Grace [be] [[G5485]] with [[G3326]] you. [[G4771]]
