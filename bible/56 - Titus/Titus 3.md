[[Titus 2|←]] • [[Philemon 1|→]]

### 1
Remind [[G5279]] [the believers] [[G846]] to be subject [[G5293]] to rulers [[G746]] [and] authorities, [[G1849]] to be obedient [[G3980]] [and] [[G1510]] ready [[G2092]] for [[G4314]] every [[G3956]] good [[G18]] work, [[G2041]]

### 2
to malign [[G987]] no one, [[G3367]] [and] to be [[G1510]] peaceable [[G269]] [and] gentle, [[G1933]] showing [[G1731]] full [[G3956]] consideration [[G4240]] to [[G4314]] everyone. [[G3956]]

### 3
For [[G1063]] at one time [[G4218]] we [[G1473]] too [[G2532]] were [[G1510]] foolish, [[G453]] disobedient, [[G545]] misled, [[G4105]] enslaved [[G1398]] to all sorts [[G4164]] of desires [[G1939]] and [[G2532]] pleasures, [[G2237]] living [[G1236]] in [[G1722]] malice [[G2549]] and [[G2532]] envy, [[G5355]] hateful, [[G4767]] [and] hating [[G3404]] one another. [[G240]]

### 4
But [[G1161]] when [[G3753]] the [[G3588]] kindness [[G5544]] of [[G3588]] God [[G2316]] our [[G1473]] Savior [[G4990]] and [[G2532]] [His] [[G3588]] love for mankind [[G5363]] appeared, [[G2014]]

### 5
He saved [[G4982]] us, [[G1473]] not [[G3756]] by [[G1537]] [the] righteous [[G1343]] deeds [[G2041]] we [[G1473]] had done, [[G4160]] but [[G235]] according to [[G2596]] His [[G846]] mercy, [[G1656]] through [[G1223]] [the] washing [[G3067]] of new birth [[G3824]] and [[G2532]] renewal [[G342]] by [the] Holy [[G40]] Spirit. [[G4151]]

### 6
[ This is the Spirit ] [[G3739]] He poured out [[G1632]] on [[G1909]] us [[G1473]] abundantly [[G4146]] through [[G1223]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ [[G5547]] our [[G1473]] Savior, [[G4990]]

### 7
so that, [[G2443]] having been justified [[G1344]] by [His] [[G1565]] grace, [[G5485]] we would become [[G1096]] heirs [[G2818]] with [[G2596]] [the] hope [[G1680]] of eternal [[G166]] life. [[G2222]]

### 8
[This] [[G3588]] saying [[G3056]] [is] trustworthy. [[G4103]] And [[G2532]] I want [[G1014]] you [[G4771]] to emphasize [[G1226]] these things, [[G3778]] so that [[G2443]] those who [[G3588]] have believed [[G4100]] God [[G2316]] will take care [[G5431]] to devote themselves to [[G4291]] good [[G2570]] deeds. [[G2041]] These things [[G3778]] are [[G1510]] excellent [[G2570]] and [[G2532]] profitable [[G5624]] for the [[G3588]] people. [[G444]]

### 9
But [[G1161]] avoid [[G4026]] foolish [[G3474]] controversies, [[G2214]] genealogies, [[G1076]] arguments, [[G2054]] and [[G2532]] quarrels [[G3163]] about [the] Law, [[G3544]] because [[G1063]] [these things] are [[G1510]] pointless [[G512]] and [[G2532]] worthless. [[G3152]]

### 10
Reject [[G3868]] a divisive [[G141]] man [[G444]] after [[G3326]] a first [[G1520]] and [[G2532]] second [[G1208]] admonition, [[G3559]]

### 11
knowing [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] such a man [[G5108]] is corrupt [[G1612]] and [[G2532]] sinful; [[G264]] he is [[G1510]] self-condemned. [[G843]]

### 12
As soon as [[G3752]] I send [[G3992]] Artemas [[G734]] or [[G2228]] Tychicus [[G5190]] to [[G4314]] you, [[G4771]] make every effort [[G4704]] to come [[G2064]] to [[G4314]] me [[G1473]] at [[G1519]] Nicopolis, [[G3533]] because [[G1063]] I have decided [[G2919]] to winter [[G3914]] there. [[G1563]]

### 13
Do your best [[G4709]] to equip [[G4311]] Zenas [[G2211]] the [[G3588]] lawyer [[G3544]] and [[G2532]] Apollos, [[G625]] so that [[G2443]] they [[G846]] will have everything they need. [[G3007]]

### 14
And [[G1161]] our [people] [[G2251]] must also learn [[G3129]] to devote themselves to [[G4291]] good [[G2570]] works [[G2041]] in order to meet [[G1519]] [the] pressing [[G316]] needs [of others], [[G5532]] so that [[G2443]] they will not be [[G1510]] unfruitful. [[G175]]

### 15
All [[G3956]] who [are] [[G3588]] with [[G3326]] me [[G1473]] send you greetings. [[G782]] Greet [[G782]] those who [[G3588]] love [[G5368]] us [[G1473]] in [[G1722]] [the] faith. [[G4102]] Grace [be] [[G5485]] with [[G3326]] all [[G3956]] of you. [[G4771]]
