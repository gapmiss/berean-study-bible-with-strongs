###### 1
Finally, [[G3063]] my [[G1473]] brothers, [[G80]] rejoice [[G5463]] in [[G1722]] [the] Lord. [[G2962]] [It is] no [[G3756]] trouble [[G3636]] for me [[G1473]] to write [[G1125]] the [[G3588]] same things [[G846]] to you [[G4771]] again, [[G3303]] and [[G1161]] [it is] a safeguard [[G804]] for you. [[G4771]]

###### 2
Watch out for [[G991]] those [[G3588]] dogs, [[G2965]] those [[G3588]] workers [[G2040]] of evil, [[G2556]] those [[G3588]] mutilators of the flesh! [[G2699]]

###### 3
For [[G1063]] [it is] we [[G1473]] [who] are [[G1510]] the [[G3588]] circumcision, [[G4061]] we who [[G3588]] worship [[G3000]] by [the] Spirit [[G4151]] of God, [[G2316]] who [[G2532]] glory [[G2744]] in [[G1722]] Christ [[G5547]] Jesus, [[G2424]] and [who] [[G2532]] put no confidence [[G3982]] in [[G1722]] [the] flesh— [[G4561]]

###### 4
though [[G2539]] I myself [[G1473]] could have [[G2192]] such confidence. [[G4006]] If [[G1487]] anyone [[G5100]] else [[G243]] thinks [[G1380]] he has grounds for confidence [[G3982]] in [[G1722]] [the] flesh, [[G4561]] I [[G1473]] [have] more: [[G3123]]

###### 5
circumcised [[G4061]] on [the] eighth day, [[G3637]] of [[G1537]] [the] people [[G1085]] of Israel, [[G2474]] of [the] tribe [[G5443]] of Benjamin; [[G958]] a Hebrew [[G1445]] of [[G1537]] Hebrews; [[G1445]] as to [[G2596]] [the] Law, [[G3551]] a Pharisee; [[G5330]]

###### 6
as to [[G2596]] zeal, [[G2205]] persecuting [[G1377]] the [[G3588]] church; [[G1577]] as to [[G2596]] righteousness [[G1343]] under [[G1722]] [the] Law, [[G3551]] faultless. [[G273]]

###### 7
But [[G235]] whatever [[G3748]] was [[G1510]] an asset [[G2771]] to me [[G1473]] I count as [[G2233]] loss [[G2209]] for the sake of [[G1223]] Christ. [[G5547]]

###### 8
More than that, [[G235]] I count [[G2233]] all things [[G3956]] as [[G1510]] loss [[G2209]] compared to [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] surpassing excellence [[G5242]] of [[G3588]] knowing [[G1108]] Christ [[G5547]] Jesus [[G2424]] my [[G1473]] Lord, [[G2962]] for [[G1223]] whom [[G3739]] I have lost [[G2210]] all things. [[G3956]] I consider [them] [[G2233]] rubbish, [[G4657]] that [[G2443]] I may gain [[G2770]] Christ [[G5547]]

###### 9
and [[G2532]] be found [[G2147]] in [[G1722]] Him, [[G846]] not [[G3361]] having [[G2192]] my own [[G1699]] righteousness [[G1343]] from [[G1537]] [the] Law, [[G3551]] but [[G235]] that which [[G3588]] [is] through [[G1223]] faith [[G4102]] in Christ, [[G5547]] the [[G3588]] righteousness [[G1343]] from [[G1537]] God [[G2316]] on the basis of [[G1909]] faith. [[G4102]]

###### 10
[I want] to know [[G1097]] [Christ] [[G846]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] power [[G1411]] of [[G3588]] His [[G846]] resurrection [[G386]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] fellowship [[G2842]] of [[G3588]] His [[G846]] sufferings, [[G3804]] being conformed [[G4833]] to [Him] [[G3588]] in His [[G846]] death, [[G2288]]

###### 11
and so, [[G1487]] somehow, [[G4459]] to attain [[G2658]] to [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] resurrection [[G1815]] from [[G1537]] [the] dead. [[G3498]]

###### 12
Not [[G3756]] that [[G3754]] I have already obtained [all this], [[G2983]] or [[G2228]] have already been perfected, [[G5048]] but [[G1161]] I press on [[G1377]] to take hold of [[G2638]] that for which [[G1909]] Christ [[G5547]] Jesus [[G2424]] took hold of me. [[G2638]]

###### 13
Brothers, [[G80]] I [[G1473]] {do} not [[G3756]] consider [[G3049]] myself [[G1683]] yet to have laid hold [of it]. [[G2638]] But [[G1161]] one thing [I do]: [[G1520]] Forgetting [[G1950]] what is [[G3588]] behind [[G3694]] and [[G1161]] straining toward [[G1901]] what [is] [[G3588]] ahead, [[G1715]]

###### 14
I press on [[G1377]] toward [[G2596]] [the] goal [[G4649]] to [win] [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] prize [[G1017]] of [[G3588]] God’s [[G2316]] heavenly [[G507]] calling [[G2821]] in [[G1722]] Christ [[G5547]] Jesus. [[G2424]]

###### 15
All of us who [[G3745]] [are] mature [[G5046]] should embrace this point of view. [[G5426]] And [[G2532]] if [[G1487]] you think [[G5426]] differently [[G2088]] about some issue, [[G5100]] God [[G2316]] will reveal [[G601]] this [[G3778]] to you [[G4771]] as well. [[G2532]]

###### 16
Nevertheless, [[G4133]] we must live up [[G4748]] to [[G1519]] what [[G3739]] we have already attained. [[G5348]]

###### 17
Join one another in following [[G4831]] my [example], [[G1473]] brothers, [[G80]] and [[G2532]] carefully observe [[G4648]] those who [[G3588]] live [[G4043]] according to [[G2531]] the pattern [[G5179]] we set for you. [[G2192]]

###### 18
For [[G1063]] [as] [[G3739]] I have often told [[G2036]] you {before}, [[G4771]] and [[G1161]] now [[G3568]] declare [[G3004]] even [[G2532]] with tears: [[G2799]] Many [[G4183]] live [[G4043]] [as] enemies [[G2190]] of the [[G3588]] cross [[G4716]] of Christ. [[G5547]]

###### 19
[Their] [[G3739]] end [is] [[G5056]] destruction, [[G684]] [their] [[G3739]] god [is] [[G2316]] [their] [[G3588]] belly, [[G2836]] and [[G2532]] [their] [[G3588]] glory [[G1391]] [is] in [[G1722]] their [[G846]] shame. [[G152]] Their [[G3588]] minds are set on [[G5426]] earthly [[G1919]] things. [[G3588]]

###### 20
But [[G1063]] our [[G1473]] citizenship [[G4175]] is [[G5225]] in [[G1722]] heaven, [[G3772]] and [[G2532]] we eagerly await [[G553]] a Savior [[G4990]] from [[G1537]] [there], [[G3739]] [the] Lord [[G2962]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ, [[G5547]]

###### 21
who, [[G3739]] by [[G2596]] the [[G3588]] power [[G1753]] that enables Him [[G1410]] to subject [[G5293]] all things [[G3956]] to Himself, [[G848]] will transform [[G3345]] our [[G1473]] lowly [[G5014]] bodies [[G4983]] to be like [[G4832]] His [[G846]] glorious [[G1391]] body. [[G4983]]
