### 1
Therefore [[G3767]] if [you have] [[G1487]] any [[G5100]] encouragement [[G3874]] in [[G1722]] Christ, [[G5547]] if [[G1487]] any [[G5100]] comfort [[G3890]] from [His] love, [[G26]] if [[G1487]] any [[G5100]] fellowship [[G2842]] with [the] Spirit, [[G4151]] if [[G1487]] any [[G5100]] affection [[G4698]] and [[G2532]] compassion, [[G3628]]

### 2
[then] {make} my [[G1473]] joy [[G5479]] complete [[G4137]] by being of one mind, [[G5426]] having [[G2192]] the [[G3588]] same [[G846]] love, [[G26]] being united in spirit [and] [[G4861]] purpose. [[G1520]]

### 3
[Do] nothing [[G3367]] out of [[G2596]] selfish ambition [[G2052]] or [[G3366]] empty pride, [[G2754]] but [[G235]] in humility [[G5012]] consider [[G2233]] others [[G240]] more important than [[G5242]] yourselves. [[G1438]]

### 4
Each [of you] [[G1538]] should look [[G4648]] not only {to} [[G3361]] your own [[G1438]] interests, [[G3588]] but [[G235]] also [[G2532]] to the interests [[G3588]] of others. [[G2087]]

### 5
Let this mind be [[G5426]] in [[G1722]] you [[G4771]] which [[G3739]] [was] also [[G2532]] in [[G1722]] Christ [[G5547]] Jesus: [[G2424]]

### 6
Who, [[G3739]] existing [[G5225]] in [[G1722]] [the] form [[G3444]] of God, [[G2316]] {did} not [[G3756]] consider [[G2233]] equality [[G2470]] with God [[G2316]] something to be grasped, [[G725]]

### 7
but [[G235]] emptied [[G2758]] Himself, [[G1438]] taking [[G2983]] [the] form [[G3444]] of a servant, [[G1401]] being made [[G1096]] in [[G1722]] human likeness. [[G3667]]

### 8
And [[G2532]] being found [[G2147]] in appearance [[G4976]] as [[G5613]] a man, [[G444]] He humbled [[G5013]] Himself [[G1438]] [and] became [[G1096]] obedient [[G5255]] to [[G3360]] death— [[G2288]] even [[G1161]] death [[G2288]] on [a] cross. [[G4716]]

### 9
Therefore [[G1352]] God [[G2316]] exalted [[G5251]] Him {to the highest place} [[G846]] and [[G2532]] gave [[G5483]] Him [[G846]] the [[G3588]] name [[G3686]] above [[G5228]] all [[G3956]] names, [[G3686]]

### 10
that [[G2443]] at [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] name [[G3686]] of Jesus [[G2424]] every [[G3956]] knee [[G1119]] should bow, [[G2578]] in heaven [[G2032]] and [[G2532]] on earth [[G1919]] and [[G2532]] under the earth, [[G2709]]

### 11
and [[G2532]] every [[G3956]] tongue [[G1100]] confess [[G1843]] that [[G3754]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ [[G5547]] [is] Lord, [[G2962]] to [[G1519]] [the] glory [[G1391]] of God [[G2316]] [the] Father. [[G3962]]

### 12
Therefore, [[G5620]] my [[G1473]] beloved, [[G27]] just as [[G2531]] you have always obeyed, [[G5219]] not [[G3361]] only [[G3440]] in [[G1722]] my [[G1473]] presence, [[G3952]] but [[G235]] now [[G3568]] even [[G4183]] more [[G3123]] in [[G1722]] my [[G1473]] absence, [[G666]] continue to work out [[G2716]] your [[G1438]] salvation [[G4991]] with [[G3326]] fear [[G5401]] and [[G2532]] trembling. [[G5156]]

### 13
For [[G1063]] it is [[G1510]] God [[G2316]] who [[G3588]] works [[G1754]] in [[G1722]] you [[G4771]] to will [[G2309]] and [[G2532]] to act [[G1754]] on behalf of [[G5228]] [His] [[G3588]] good pleasure. [[G2107]]

### 14
Do [[G4160]] everything [[G3956]] without [[G5565]] complaining [[G1112]] [or] [[G2532]] arguing, [[G1261]]

### 15
so that [[G2443]] you may be [[G1096]] blameless [[G273]] and [[G2532]] pure, [[G185]] children [[G5043]] of God [[G2316]] without fault [[G299]] in [[G3319]] a crooked [[G4646]] and [[G2532]] perverse [[G1294]] generation, [[G1074]] in [[G1722]] which [[G3739]] you shine [[G5316]] as [[G5613]] lights [[G5458]] in [[G1722]] [the] world [[G2889]]

### 16
as you hold forth [[G1907]] [the] word [[G3056]] of life, [[G2222]] in order that [[G1519]] I [[G1473]] may boast [[G2745]] on [[G1519]] [the] day [[G2250]] of Christ [[G5547]] that [[G3754]] I did not run [[G5143]] [or] [[G3761]] labor [[G2872]] in [[G1519]] vain. [[G2756]]

### 17
But [[G235]] even [[G2532]] if [[G1487]] I am being poured out like a drink offering [[G4689]] on [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] sacrifice [[G2378]] and [[G2532]] service [[G3009]] of [[G3588]] your [[G4771]] faith, [[G4102]] I am glad [[G5463]] and [[G2532]] rejoice with [[G4796]] all [[G3956]] of you. [[G4771]]

### 18
So [[G846]] you [[G4771]] too [[G2532]] should be glad [[G5463]] and [[G2532]] rejoice with [[G4796]] me. [[G1473]]

### 19
Now [[G1161]] I hope [[G1679]] in [[G1722]] [the] Lord [[G2962]] Jesus [[G2424]] to send [[G3992]] Timothy [[G5095]] to you [[G4771]] soon, [[G5030]] that [[G2443]] I also [[G2504]] may be cheered [[G2174]] when I learn [[G1097]] how [[G4012]] you {are doing}. [[G4771]]

### 20
I have [[G2192]] nobody else [[G3762]] like him [[G2473]] who [[G3748]] {will} genuinely [[G1104]] care for [[G3309]] your [[G4771]] needs. [[G3588]]

### 21
For [[G1063]] all [[G3956]] the others [[G3588]] look after [[G2212]] their own [[G1438]] interests, [[G3588]] not [[G3756]] those [[G3588]] of Jesus [[G2424]] Christ. [[G5547]]

### 22
But [[G1161]] you know [[G1097]] [Timothy’s] [[G846]] proven worth, [[G1382]] that [[G3754]] as [[G5613]] a child [[G5043]] [with his] father [[G3962]] he has served [[G1398]] with [[G4862]] me [[G1473]] to [advance] [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] gospel. [[G2098]]

### 23
So [[G3767]] I hope [[G1679]] to send [[G3992]] him [[G3778]] as soon as [[G1824]] I see [[G872]] what happens [[G3588]] with [[G4012]] me. [[G1473]]

### 24
And [[G1161]] I trust [[G3982]] in [[G1722]] [the] Lord [[G2962]] that [[G3754]] I myself [[G846]] will come [[G2064]] soon. [[G5030]]

### 25
But [[G1161]] I thought [it] [[G2233]] necessary [[G316]] to send back [[G3992]] to [[G4314]] you [[G4771]] Epaphroditus, [[G1891]] my [[G1473]] brother, [[G80]] fellow worker, [[G4904]] and [[G2532]] fellow soldier, [[G4961]] [who is] also [[G1161]] your [[G4771]] messenger [[G652]] and [[G2532]] minister [[G3011]] to my [[G1473]] needs. [[G5532]]

### 26
For [[G1894]] he has been [[G1510]] longing for [[G1971]] all [[G3956]] of you [[G4771]] and [[G2532]] is distressed [[G85]] because [[G1360]] you heard [[G191]] he was ill. [[G770]]

### 27
He was sick [[G770]] indeed, [[G2532]] nearly [[G3897]] unto death. [[G2288]] But [[G235]] God [[G2316]] had mercy on [[G1653]] him, [[G846]] and [[G1161]] not [[G3756]] only [[G3441]] on him [[G846]] but [[G235]] also [[G2532]] on me, [[G1473]] to [[G2443]] spare me [[G2192]] sorrow [[G3077]] upon [[G1909]] sorrow. [[G3077]]

### 28
Therefore [[G3767]] {I am} all the more eager [[G4708]] to send [[G3992]] him, [[G846]] so that [[G2443]] when you see [[G3708]] him [[G846]] again [[G3825]] you may rejoice, [[G5463]] and I [[G2504]] may be [[G1510]] less anxious. [[G253]]

### 29
Welcome [[G4327]] him [[G846]] in [[G1722]] [the] Lord [[G2962]] with [[G3326]] great [[G3956]] joy, [[G5479]] and [[G2532]] honor [[G1784]] men [like him], [[G5108]]

### 30
because [[G3754]] he nearly [[G1448]] died [[G2288]] for [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] work [[G2041]] of Christ, [[G5547]] risking [[G3851]] [his] [[G3588]] life [[G5590]] to make up for [[G378]] your [[G4771]] deficit [[G5303]] of [[G3588]] service [[G3009]] to [[G4314]] me. [[G1473]]
