###### 1
Now the serpent [[H5175]] was [[H1961]] more crafty [[H6175]] than any [[H3605]] beast [[H2416]] of the field [[H7704]] that [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] God [[H430]] had made. [[H6213]] And he said [[H559]] to [[H413]] the woman, [[H802]] “Did God [[H430]] really [[H3588]] say, [[H559]] ‘You must not [[H3808]] eat [[H398]] of any [[H3605]] tree [[H6086]] in the garden?’” [[H1588]]

###### 2
The woman [[H802]] answered [[H559]] the serpent, [[H5175]] “We may eat [[H398]] the fruit [[H6529]] of the trees [[H6086]] of the garden, [[H1588]]

###### 3
but of the fruit [[H6529]] of the tree [[H6086]] in the middle [[H8432]] of the garden, [[H1588]] God [[H430]] has said, [[H559]] ‘You must not [[H3808]] eat [[H398]] of it [[H4480]] [or] [[H3808]] touch [[H5060]] it,  [or] [[H6435]] you will die.’” [[H4191]]

###### 4
“You will not [[H3808]] surely [[H4191]] die,” [[H4191]] the serpent [[H5175]] told [[H559]] [her]. [[H802]]

###### 5
“For [[H3588]] God [[H430]] knows [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] in the day [[H3117]] you eat [[H398]] of it, [[H4480]] your eyes [[H5869]] will be [[H1961]] opened [[H6491]] and you will be like God, [[H430]] knowing [[H3045]] good [[H2896]] and evil.” [[H7451]]

###### 6
When the woman [[H802]] saw [[H7200]] that [[H3588]] the tree [[H6086]] [was] good [[H2896]] for food [[H3978]] and [[H3588]] pleasing [[H8378]] to the eyes, [[H5869]] [and that it was] [[H6086]] desirable [[H2530]] for obtaining wisdom, [[H7919]] she took [[H3947]] the fruit [[H6529]] and ate it. [[H398]] She also gave [some] [[H5414]] to her husband, [[H582]] and he ate it. [[H398]]

###### 7
And the eyes [[H5869]] of both of them [[H8147]] were opened, [[H6491]] and they [[H1992]] knew [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] they [were] naked; [[H5903]] so they sewed together [[H8609]] fig [[H8384]] leaves [[H5929]] and made [[H6213]] coverings [[H2290]] for themselves. 

###### 8
Then the man [[H120]] and his wife [[H802]] heard [[H8085]] the voice [[H6963]] of the LORD [[H3068]] God [[H430]] walking [[H1980]] in the garden [[H1588]] in the breeze [[H7307]] of the day, [[H3117]] and they hid themselves [[H2244]] from the presence [[H6440]] of the LORD [[H3068]] God [[H430]] among [[H8432]] the trees [[H6086]] of the garden. [[H1588]]

###### 9
So the LORD [[H3068]] God [[H430]] called out [[H7121]] to [[H413]] the man, [[H120]] “Where [are] you?” [[H335]]

###### 10
“I heard [[H8085]] Your voice [[H6963]] in the garden,” [[H1588]] he replied, [[H559]] “and I was afraid [[H3372]] because [[H3588]] I [[H595]] [was] naked; [[H5903]] so I hid myself.” [[H2244]]

###### 11
“Who [[H4310]] told [[H5046]] you [[H859]] that [[H3588]] you [were] naked?” [[H5903]] asked the LORD God. [[H559]] “Have you eaten [[H398]] of [[H4480]] the tree [[H6086]] from which [[H834]] I commanded you [[H6680]] not to [[H1115]] eat?” [[H398]]

###### 12
And the man [[H120]] answered, [[H559]] “The woman [[H802]] whom [[H834]] You gave [[H5414]] me, [[H5978]] she [[H1931]] gave [[H5414]] me [fruit] from [[H4480]] the tree, [[H6086]] and I ate it.” [[H398]]

###### 13
Then the LORD [[H3068]] God [[H430]] said [[H559]] to the woman, [[H802]] “What [[H4100]] [is] this [[H2063]] you have done?” [[H6213]] “The serpent [[H5175]] deceived me,” [[H5377]] [she] [[H802]] replied, [[H559]] “and I ate.” [[H398]]

###### 14
So the LORD [[H3068]] God [[H430]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] the serpent: [[H5175]] “Because [[H3588]] you have done [[H6213]] this, [[H2063]] cursed [[H779]] are you [[H859]] above all [[H3605]] livestock [[H929]] and every [[H3605]] beast [[H2416]] of the field! [[H7704]] On [[H5921]] your belly [[H1512]] {will} you go, [[H1980]] and dust [[H6083]] you {will} eat, [[H398]] all [[H3605]] the days [[H3117]] of your life. [[H2416]]

###### 15
And [[H996]] I will put [[H7896]] enmity [[H342]] between [you] [[H996]] and the woman, [[H802]] and between [[H996]] your seed [[H2233]] and her seed. [[H2233]] He [[H1931]] {will} crush [[H7779]] your head, [[H7218]] and you [[H859]] {will} strike [[H7779]] his heel.” [[H6119]]

###### 16
To [[H413]] the woman [[H802]] He said: [[H559]] “I will sharply [[H7235]] increase [[H7235]] your pain [[H6093]] in childbirth; [[H2032]] in pain [[H6089]] you will bring forth [[H3205]] children. [[H1121]] Your desire [[H8669]] [will be] for [[H413]] your husband, [[H376]] and he [[H1931]] {will} rule [[H4910]] over you.” 

###### 17
And to Adam [[H121]] He said: [[H559]] “Because [[H3588]] you have listened [[H8085]] to the voice [[H6963]] of [[H4480]] your wife [[H802]] and have eaten [[H398]] of the tree [[H6086]] from which [[H834]] I commanded [[H6680]] you not [[H3808]] to eat, [[H398]] cursed [[H779]] [is] the ground [[H127]] because of you; [[H5668]] through toil [[H6093]] you will eat [of] it [[H398]] all [[H3605]] the days [[H3117]] of your life. [[H2416]]

###### 18
Both thorns [[H6975]] and thistles [[H1863]] it {will} yield [[H6779]] you,  and you {will} eat [[H398]] the plants [[H6212]] of the field. [[H7704]]

###### 19
By the sweat [[H2188]] of your brow [[H639]] you will eat [[H398]] [your] bread, [[H3899]] until [[H5704]] you return [[H7725]] to [[H413]] the ground— [[H127]] because [[H3588]] out of it [[H4480]] were you taken. [[H3947]] For [[H3588]] dust [[H6083]] you [are], [[H859]] and to [[H413]] dust [[H6083]] you {shall} return.” [[H7725]]

###### 20
And Adam [[H120]] named [[H8034]] his wife [[H802]] Eve, [[H2332]] because [[H3588]] she [[H1931]] would become [[H1961]] the mother [[H517]] of all [[H3605]] the living. [[H2416]]

###### 21
The LORD [[H3068]] God [[H430]] made [[H6213]] garments [[H3801]] of skin [[H5785]] and clothed [[H3847]] Adam [[H120]] and his wife. [[H802]]

###### 22
Then the LORD [[H3068]] God [[H430]] said, [[H559]] “Behold, [[H2005]] the man [[H120]] has become [[H1961]] like one [[H259]] of Us, [[H4480]] knowing [[H3045]] good [[H2896]] and evil. [[H7451]] And now, [[H6258]] lest [[H6435]] he reach out [[H7971]] his hand [[H3027]] and take [[H3947]] also [[H1571]] from the tree [[H6086]] of life, [[H2416]] and eat, [[H398]] and live [[H2425]] forever... [[H5769]]

###### 23
Therefore the LORD [[H3068]] God [[H430]] banished him [[H7971]] from the Garden [[H1588]] of Eden [[H5731]] to work [[H5647]] the ground [[H127]] from which [[H834]] he had been taken. [[H3947]]

###### 24
So He drove out [[H1644]] the man [[H120]] and [[H853]] stationed [[H7931]] cherubim [[H3742]] to the east [[H6924]] of the Garden [[H1588]] of Eden, [[H5731]] with [[H853]] a whirling [[H2015]] sword [[H2719]] of flame [[H3858]] to guard [[H8104]] the way [[H1870]] to the tree [[H6086]] of life.
