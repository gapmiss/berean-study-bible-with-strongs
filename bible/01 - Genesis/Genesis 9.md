### 1
And God [[H430]] blessed [[H1288]] Noah [[H5146]] and his sons [[H1121]] and said [[H559]] to them,  “Be fruitful [[H6509]] and multiply [[H7235]] and fill [[H4390]] the earth. [[H776]]

### 2
The fear [[H4172]] and dread of you [[H2844]] will fall [[H1961]] on [[H5921]] every [[H3605]] living creature [[H2416]] on the earth, [[H776]] every [[H3605]] bird [[H5775]] of the sky, [[H8064]] every [[H3605]] creature that [[H834]] crawls [[H7430]] on the ground, [[H127]] and all [[H3605]] the fish [[H1709]] of the sea. [[H3220]] They are delivered [[H5414]] into your hand. [[H3027]]

### 3
Every [[H3605]] living [[H2416]] creature [[H7431]] will be [[H1961]] food for you; [[H402]] just as I gave you the green [[H3418]] plants, [[H6212]] I now give [[H5414]] you [[H853]] all things. [[H3605]]

### 4
But [[H389]] you must not [[H3808]] eat [[H398]] meat [[H1320]] with its lifeblood [[H5315]] [still] in it. [[H1818]]

### 5
And surely [[H389]] I will require [[H1875]] the life of any [[H3605]] man [[H120]] or beast [[H2416]] by whose hand [[H3027]] your lifeblood [is shed]. [[H5315]] I will demand an accounting [[H1875]] from anyone [[H120]] [who takes] the life [[H5315]] of his fellow man: [[H376]]

### 6
Whoever sheds [[H8210]] the blood [[H1818]] of man, [[H120]] by man [[H120]] his blood [[H1818]] will be shed; [[H8210]] for [[H3588]] in His own [[H430]] image [[H6754]] God has made [[H6213]] mankind. [[H120]]

### 7
But as for you, [[H859]] be fruitful [[H6509]] and multiply; [[H7235]] spread out [[H8317]] across the earth [[H776]] and multiply upon it.” [[H7235]]

### 8
Then God [[H430]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Noah [[H5146]] and his sons [[H1121]] with him, [[H854]]

### 9
“Behold, [[H2005]] I now [[H589]] establish [[H6965]] My covenant [[H1285]] with you [[H854]] and your [[H854]] descendants [[H2233]] after you, [[H310]]

### 10
and with [[H854]] every [[H3605]] living [[H2416]] creature [[H5315]] that [[H834]] [was] with you— [[H854]] the birds, [[H5775]] the livestock, [[H929]] and every [[H3605]] beast [[H2416]] of the earth— [[H776]] every [[H3605]] living thing [[H2416]] that came out [[H3318]] of the ark. [[H8392]]

### 11
And I establish [[H6965]] My covenant [[H1285]] with you: [[H854]] Never [[H3808]] again [[H5750]] will all [[H3605]] life [[H1320]] be cut off [[H3772]] by the waters [[H4325]] of a flood; [[H3999]] never [[H3808]] again [[H5750]] will there be [[H1961]] a flood [[H3999]] to destroy [[H7843]] the earth.” [[H776]]

### 12
And God [[H430]] said, [[H559]] “This [[H2063]] is the sign [[H226]] of the covenant [[H1285]] I [[H589]] am making [[H5414]] between Me and you [[H996]] and every [[H3605]] living [[H2416]] creature [[H5315]] with you, [[H854]] [a covenant] for all generations [[H1755]] to come: [[H5769]]

### 13
I have set [[H5414]] My rainbow [[H7198]] in the clouds, [[H6051]] and it will be [[H1961]] a sign [[H226]] of the covenant [[H1285]] between [[H996]] Me [[H996]] and the earth. [[H776]]

### 14
Whenever I form [[H6049]] clouds [[H6051]] over [[H5921]] the earth [[H776]] and the rainbow [[H7198]] appears [[H7200]] in the clouds, [[H6051]]

### 15
I will remember [[H2142]] My covenant [[H1285]] between Me and you [[H996]] and all [[H3605]] living [[H2416]] creatures: [[H5315]] Never [[H3808]] again [[H5750]] will the waters [[H4325]] become [[H1961]] a flood [[H3999]] to destroy [[H7843]] all [[H3605]] life. [[H1320]]

### 16
And whenever the rainbow [[H7198]] appears [[H1961]] in the clouds, [[H6051]] I will see it [[H7200]] and remember [[H2142]] the everlasting [[H5769]] covenant [[H1285]] between [[H996]] God [[H430]] and [[H996]] every [[H3605]] living [[H2416]] creature [[H5315]] of every [[H3605]] kind [[H1320]] that [is] [[H834]] on [[H5921]] the earth.” [[H776]]

### 17
So God [[H430]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Noah, [[H5146]] “This [[H2063]] is the sign [[H226]] of the covenant [[H1285]] that [[H834]] I have established [[H6965]] between [[H996]] Me [[H996]] and all [[H3605]] living things [[H1320]] on [[H5921]] the earth.” [[H776]]

### 18
The sons [[H1121]] of Noah [[H5146]] who came out [[H3318]] of [[H4480]] the ark [[H8392]] were [[H1961]] Shem, [[H8035]] Ham, [[H2526]] and Japheth. [[H3315]] And Ham [[H2526]] was the father [[H1]] of Canaan. [[H3667]]

### 19
These [[H428]] three [[H7969]] were the sons [[H1121]] of Noah, [[H5146]] and from them [[H428]] the whole [[H3605]] earth [[H776]] was populated. [[H5310]]

### 20
Now Noah, [[H5146]] a man [[H582]] of the soil, [[H127]] proceeded [[H2490]] to plant [[H5193]] a vineyard. [[H3754]]

### 21
But when he drank [[H8354]] some of [[H4480]] its wine, [[H3196]] he became drunk [[H7937]] and uncovered himself [[H1540]] inside [[H8432]] his tent. [[H168]]

### 22
Ham, [[H2526]] the father [[H1]] of Canaan, [[H3667]] saw [[H7200]] his father’s [[H1]] nakedness [[H6172]] and told [[H5046]] his two [[H8147]] brothers [[H251]] outside. [[H2351]]

### 23
Then Shem [[H8035]] and Japheth [[H3315]] took [[H3947]] a garment [[H8071]] and placed [[H7760]] it across [[H5921]] their shoulders, [[H7926]] and walking [[H1980]] backward, [[H322]] they covered [[H3680]] their father’s [[H1]] nakedness. [[H6172]] Their faces [[H6440]] were turned away [[H322]] so that they did not [[H3808]] see [[H7200]] their father’s [[H1]] nakedness. [[H6172]]

### 24
When Noah [[H5146]] awoke [[H3364]] from his drunkenness [[H3196]] and learned [[H3045]] what [[H834]] his youngest [[H6996]] son [[H1121]] had done [[H6213]] to him, 

### 25
he said, [[H559]] “Cursed be [[H779]] Canaan! [[H3667]] A servant [[H5650]] of servants [[H5650]] shall he be [[H1961]] to his brothers.” [[H251]]

### 26
He also declared: [[H559]] “Blessed [[H1288]] [be] the LORD, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of Shem! [[H8035]] May Canaan [[H3667]] be [[H1961]] the servant [[H5650]] of [Shem]. [[H3926]]

### 27
{May} God [[H430]] expand the territory [[H6601]] of Japheth, [[H3315]] may he dwell [[H7931]] in the tents [[H168]] of Shem, [[H8035]] and may Canaan [[H3667]] be [[H1961]] his servant.” [[H5650]]

### 28
After [[H310]] the flood, [[H3999]] Noah [[H5146]] lived [[H2421]] 350 [[H7969]] years. [[H8141]]

### 29
So Noah [[H5146]] lived [[H3117]] a total of [[H1961]] 950 [[H8672]] years, [[H8141]] and then he died. [[H4191]]
