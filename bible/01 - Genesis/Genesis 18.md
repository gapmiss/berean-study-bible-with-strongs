### 1
Then the LORD [[H3068]] appeared [[H7200]] to [[H413]] Abraham by the oaks [[H436]] of Mamre [[H4471]] in the heat [[H2527]] of the day, [[H3117]] while he [[H1931]] was sitting [[H3427]] at the entrance [[H6607]] to his tent. [[H168]]

### 2
And [Abraham] lifted up [[H5375]] his eyes [[H5869]] and saw [[H7200]] three [[H7969]] men [[H376]] standing [[H5324]] nearby. [[H5921]] When he saw them, [[H7200]] he ran from [[H7323]] the entrance [[H6607]] of his tent [[H168]] to meet them [[H7125]] and bowed low [[H7812]] to the ground. [[H776]]

### 3
“My lord,” [[H113]] said [Abraham], [[H559]] “if [[H518]] I have found [[H4672]] favor [[H2580]] in your sight, [[H5869]] please [[H4994]] do not [[H408]] pass [[H5674]] your servant {by}. [[H5650]]

### 4
Let a little [[H4592]] water [[H4325]] be brought, [[H3947]] that you may wash [[H7364]] your feet [[H7272]] and rest [[H8172]] yourselves under [[H8478]] the tree. [[H6086]]

### 5
And I will bring [[H3947]] a bit [[H6595]] of bread [[H3899]] so that you may refresh [[H5582]] yourselves. [[H3820]] This is why [[H3588]] you have passed [[H5674]] your servant’s way. [[H5650]] After that, [[H310]] you may continue on your way.” [[H5674]] “Yes,” [[H3651]] they replied, [[H559]] “you may do [[H6213]] as [[H834]] you have said.” [[H1696]]

### 6
So Abraham [[H85]] hurried [[H4116]] into the tent [[H168]] and said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Sarah, [[H8283]] “Quick! Prepare [[H4116]] three [[H7969]] seahs [[H5429]] of fine [[H5560]] flour, [[H7058]] knead it, [[H3888]] and bake [[H6213]] some bread.” [[H5692]]

### 7
Meanwhile, Abraham [[H85]] ran [[H7323]] to [[H413]] the herd, [[H1241]] selected [[H3947]] a tender, [[H7390]] choice [[H2896]] calf, [[H1121]] and gave [[H5414]] it to [[H413]] a servant, [[H5288]] who hurried [[H4116]] to prepare it. [[H6213]]

### 8
Then Abraham brought [[H3947]] curds [[H2529]] and milk [[H2461]] and the calf [[H1121]] that [[H834]] had been prepared, [[H6213]] and he set [[H5414]] them before the men [[H6440]] and [[H1931]] stood [[H5975]] by them [[H5921]] under [[H8478]] the tree [[H6086]] as they ate. [[H398]]

### 9
“Where [[H346]] is your wife [[H802]] Sarah?” [[H8283]] they asked. [[H559]] “There, [[H2009]] in the tent,” [[H168]] he replied. [[H559]]

### 10
Then the LORD said, [[H559]] “I will surely [[H7725]] return [[H7725]] to you [[H413]] at this time next year, [[H6256]] and your wife [[H802]] Sarah [[H8283]] will have a son!” [[H1121]] Now Sarah [[H8283]] was behind him, [[H310]] listening [[H8085]] at the entrance [[H6607]] to the tent. [[H168]]

### 11
And Abraham [[H85]] and Sarah [[H8283]] were already old [[H2205]] and well along [[H935]] in years. [[H3117]] Sarah [[H8283]] had passed [[H2308]] the age of childbearing. [[H734]]

### 12
So [she] [[H8283]] laughed [[H6711]] to herself, [[H7130]] saying, [[H559]] “After [[H310]] I am worn out [[H1086]] and my master [[H113]] is old, [[H2204]] will I now have [[H1961]] this pleasure?” [[H5730]]

### 13
And the LORD [[H3068]] asked [[H559]] Abraham, [[H85]] “Why [[H4100]] did Sarah [[H8283]] laugh [[H6711]] and say, [[H559]] ‘Can I really [[H637]] bear a child [[H3205]] when I am [[H589]] old?’ [[H2204]]

### 14
Is anything [[H1697]] too difficult [[H6381]] for the LORD? [[H3068]] At the appointed time [[H4150]] I will return [[H7725]] to you— [[H413]] in about a year— [[H6256]] and Sarah [[H8283]] will have a son.” [[H1121]]

### 15
But Sarah [[H8283]] denied it, [[H3584]] saying, [[H559]] “I did not [[H3808]] laugh.” [[H6711]] For [[H3588]] she was afraid. [[H3372]] “No,” [[H3808]] replied [the LORD], [[H559]] “but you did [[H3588]] laugh.” [[H6711]]

### 16
When [the men] got up [[H6965]] to leave [[H8033]] [they] [[H582]] looked out [[H8259]] over [[H5921]] Sodom, [[H5467]] and Abraham [[H85]] walked along [[H1980]] with [[H5973]] them to see them off. [[H7971]]

### 17
And the LORD [[H3068]] said, [[H559]] “Shall I [[H589]] hide [[H3680]] from Abraham [[H85]] what [[H834]] I [[H589]] am about to do? [[H6213]]

### 18
Abraham [[H85]] {will} surely [[H1961]] become [[H1961]] a great [[H1419]] and powerful [[H6099]] nation, [[H1471]] and through him  all [[H3605]] the nations [[H1471]] of the earth [[H776]] {will} be blessed. [[H1288]]

### 19
For [[H3588]] I have chosen [[H3045]] him, [[H4616]] so that [[H834]] he will command [[H6680]] his children [[H1121]] and [[H853]] his household [[H1004]] after [[H310]] him to keep [[H8104]] the way [[H1870]] of the LORD [[H3068]] by doing [[H6213]] what is right [[H6666]] and just, [[H4941]] in order that [[H4616]] the LORD [[H3068]] may bring [[H935]] upon [[H5921]] Abraham [[H85]] what [[H834]] He has promised. [[H1696]]

### 20
Then the LORD [[H3068]] said, [[H559]] “The outcry [[H2201]] against Sodom [[H5467]] and Gomorrah [[H6017]] is great. [[H7227]] Because [[H3588]] their sin [[H2403]] is so [[H3966]] grievous, [[H3513]]

### 21
I will go down [[H3381]] to see [[H7200]] if their actions [[H6213]] fully [[H3617]] justify the outcry [[H6818]] that has reached [[H935]] Me. [[H413]] If [[H518]] not, [[H3808]] I will find out.” [[H3045]]

### 22
And [the two] men [[H376]] turned [[H6437]] away [[H8033]] and went [[H1980]] toward Sodom, [[H5467]] but Abraham [[H85]] remained [[H5750]] standing [[H5975]] before [[H6440]] the LORD. [[H3068]]

### 23
Abraham [[H85]] stepped forward [[H5066]] and said, [[H559]] “Will You really [[H637]] sweep away [[H5595]] the righteous [[H6662]] with [[H5973]] the wicked? [[H7563]]

### 24
What if [[H194]] there are [[H3426]] fifty [[H2572]] righteous [[H6662]] ones in [[H8432]] the city? [[H5892]] Will You really [[H637]] sweep it away [[H5595]] and not [[H3808]] spare [[H5375]] the place [[H4725]] for the sake of [[H4616]] the fifty [[H2572]] righteous [[H6662]] ones [[H834]] who are there? [[H7130]]

### 25
Far be it from You [[H2486]] to do [[H6213]] such [[H2088]] a thing— [[H1697]] to kill [[H4191]] the righteous [[H6662]] with [[H5973]] the wicked, [[H7563]] so that the righteous [[H6662]] and the wicked [[H7563]] are treated alike. [[H1961]] Far be it from You! [[H2486]] Will not [[H3808]] the Judge [[H8199]] of all [[H3605]] the earth [[H776]] do [[H6213]] what is right?” [[H4941]]

### 26
So the LORD [[H3068]] replied, [[H559]] “If [[H518]] I find [[H4672]] fifty [[H2572]] righteous ones [[H6662]] within [[H8432]] the city [[H5892]] of Sodom, [[H5467]] on their account [[H5668]] I will spare [[H5375]] the whole [[H3605]] place.” [[H4725]]

### 27
Then Abraham [[H85]] answered, [[H6030]] “Now that [[H2009]] I have ventured [[H2974]] to speak [[H1696]] to [[H413]] the Lord— [[H136]] though I [[H595]] am but dust [[H6083]] and ashes— [[H665]]

### 28
suppose [[H194]] the fifty [[H2572]] righteous ones [[H6662]] lack [[H2637]] five. [[H2568]] Will you destroy [[H7843]] the whole [[H3605]] city [[H5892]] for the lack of five?” [[H2568]] He replied, [[H559]] “If [[H518]] I find [[H4672]] forty-five [[H705]] there, [[H8033]] I will not [[H3808]] destroy [it].” [[H7843]]

### 29
Once again [[H3254]] [Abraham] spoke [[H1696]] to [the LORD], [[H413]] “Suppose [[H194]] forty [[H705]] are found [[H4672]] there?” [[H8033]] He answered, [[H559]] “On account [[H5668]] of the forty, [[H705]] I will not [[H3808]] do it.” [[H6213]]

### 30
Then [Abraham] said, [[H559]] “May the Lord [[H136]] not [[H408]] be angry, [[H2734]] but let me speak [further]. [[H1696]] Suppose [[H194]] thirty [[H7970]] are found [[H4672]] there?” [[H8033]] He answered, [[H559]] “If [[H518]] I find [[H4672]] thirty [[H7970]] there, [[H8033]] I will not [[H3808]] do it.” [[H6213]]

### 31
And [Abraham] said, [[H559]] “Now that [[H2009]] I have ventured [[H2974]] to speak [[H1696]] to [[H413]] the Lord, [[H136]] suppose [[H194]] twenty [[H6242]] are found [[H4672]] there?” [[H8033]] He replied, [[H559]] “On account [[H5668]] of the twenty, [[H6242]] I will not [[H3808]] destroy [it].” [[H7843]]

### 32
Finally, [Abraham] said, [[H559]] “May the Lord [[H136]] not [[H408]] be angry, [[H2734]] but let me speak [[H1696]] once more. [[H6471]] Suppose [[H194]] ten [[H6235]] are found [[H4672]] there?” [[H8033]] And He answered, [[H559]] “On account [[H5668]] of the ten, [[H6235]] I will not [[H3808]] destroy [it].” [[H7843]]

### 33
When [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] had finished [[H3615]] speaking [[H1696]] with [[H413]] Abraham, [[H85]] He departed, [[H1980]] and Abraham [[H85]] returned [[H7725]] home. [[H4725]]
