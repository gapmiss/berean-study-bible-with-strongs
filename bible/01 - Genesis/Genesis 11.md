### 1
Now the whole [[H3605]] world [[H776]] had [[H1961]] one [[H259]] language [[H8193]] and a common [[H259]] form of speech. [[H1697]]

### 2
And [[H1961]] as people journeyed [[H5265]] eastward, [[H6924]] they found [[H4672]] a plain [[H1237]] in the land [[H776]] of Shinar [[H8152]] and settled [[H3427]] there. [[H8033]]

### 3
And they said [[H559]] to [[H413]] one [[H376]] another, [[H7453]] “Come, [[H3051]] let us make [[H3835]] bricks [[H3843]] and bake [[H8313]] them thoroughly.” [[H8316]] So they used [[H1961]] brick [[H3843]] instead of stone, [[H68]] and tar [[H2564]] instead of mortar. [[H2563]]

### 4
“Come,” [[H3051]] they said, [[H559]] “let us build [[H1129]] for ourselves  a city [[H5892]] with a tower [[H4026]] that reaches [[H7218]] to the heavens, [[H8064]] that we may make [[H6213]] a name for ourselves [[H8034]] and not [[H6435]] be scattered [[H6327]] over [[H5921]] the face [[H6440]] of the whole [[H3605]] earth.” [[H776]]

### 5
Then the LORD [[H3068]] came down [[H3381]] to see [[H7200]] the city [[H5892]] and the tower [[H4026]] that [[H834]] the sons [[H1121]] of men [[H120]] were building. [[H1129]]

### 6
And the LORD [[H3068]] said, [[H559]] “If [[H2005]] they have begun [[H2490]] to do [[H6213]] this [[H2088]] as one [[H259]] people [[H5971]] speaking the same [[H3605]] language, [[H8193]] then [[H6258]] nothing [[H3808]] they devise [[H2161]] will be beyond [[H1219]] them. [[H1992]]

### 7
Come, [[H3051]] let Us go down [[H3381]] and confuse [[H1101]] their language, [[H8193]] so that [[H834]] they will not [[H3808]] understand [[H8085]] one [[H582]] another’s [[H7453]] speech.” [[H8193]]

### 8
So the LORD [[H3068]] scattered them [[H6327]] from there [[H8033]] over [[H5921]] the face [[H6440]] of the whole [[H3605]] earth, [[H776]] and they stopped [[H2308]] building [[H1129]] the city. [[H5892]]

### 9
That is why [[H5921]] it [[H8034]] is called [[H7121]] Babel, [[H894]] for [[H3588]] there [[H8033]] the LORD [[H3068]] confused [[H1101]] the language [[H8193]] of the whole [[H3605]] world, [[H776]] and from that place [[H8033]] the LORD [[H3068]] scattered [[H6327]] them over [[H5921]] the face [[H6440]] of the whole [[H3605]] earth. [[H776]]

### 10
