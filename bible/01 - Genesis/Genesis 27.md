### 1
When [[H3588]] Isaac [[H3327]] was [[H1961]] old [[H2204]] and his eyes [[H5869]] were so weak [[H3543]] he could no longer see, [[H7200]] he called [[H7121]] his older [[H1419]] son [[H1121]] Esau [[H6215]] and said [[H559]] to him, [[H413]] “My son.” [[H1121]] “Here I am,” [[H2009]] [Esau] replied. [[H559]]

### 2
“Look,” [[H2009]] said [Isaac], [[H559]] “I am now [[H4994]] old [[H2204]] and do not [[H3808]] know [[H3045]] the day [[H3117]] of my death. [[H4194]]

### 3
Take [[H5375]] your weapons— [[H3627]] your quiver [[H8522]] and bow— [[H7198]] and go out [[H3318]] in the field [[H7704]] to hunt [[H6679]] some game [[H6720]] for me. 

### 4
Then prepare [[H6213]] a tasty dish [[H4303]] that [[H834]] I love [[H157]] and bring [[H935]] it to me  to eat, [[H398]] so that [[H5668]] I [[H5315]] may bless [[H1288]] you before [[H2962]] I die.” [[H4191]]

### 5
Now Rebekah [[H7259]] was listening [[H8085]] to what Isaac [[H3327]] told [[H1696]] his son [[H1121]] Esau. [[H6215]] So when Esau [[H6215]] went [[H1980]] into the field [[H7704]] to hunt [[H6679]] game [[H6718]] [and] bring [it back], [[H935]]

### 6
Rebekah [[H7259]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] her son [[H1121]] Jacob, [[H3290]] “Behold, [[H2009]] I overheard [[H8085]] your father [[H1]] saying [[H1696]] to [[H413]] your brother [[H251]] Esau, [[H6215]]

### 7
‘Bring [[H935]] me some game [[H6718]] and prepare [[H6213]] me  a tasty dish [[H4303]] to eat, [[H398]] so that I may bless you [[H1288]] in the presence [[H6440]] of the LORD [[H3068]] before [[H6440]] I die.’ [[H4194]]

### 8
Now, [[H6258]] my son, [[H1121]] listen to [[H8085]] my voice [[H6963]] and do exactly as [[H834]] I [[H589]] tell [[H6680]] you. [[H853]]

### 9
Go out [[H1980]] to [[H413]] the flock [[H6629]] and bring [[H3947]] me two [[H8147]] choice [[H2896]] young goats, [[H1423]] so that I can make [[H6213]] them [[H853]] into a tasty dish [[H4303]] for your father— [[H1]] the kind [[H834]] he loves. [[H157]]

### 10
Then take [[H935]] it to your father [[H1]] to eat, [[H398]] so that [[H5668]] he may bless [[H1288]] you before [[H6440]] he dies.” [[H4194]]

### 11
Jacob [[H3290]] answered [[H559]] his mother [[H517]] Rebekah, [[H7259]] “Look, [[H2005]] my brother [[H251]] Esau [[H6215]] is a hairy [[H8163]] man, [[H376]] but I am [[H595]] smooth-skinned. [[H2509]]

### 12
What if [[H194]] my father [[H1]] touches me? [[H4959]] Then I would be revealed [[H1961]] to him [[H5869]] as a deceiver, [[H8591]] and I would bring [[H935]] upon myself [[H5921]] a curse [[H7045]] rather than [[H3808]] a blessing.” [[H1293]]

### 13
His mother [[H517]] replied, [[H559]] “Your curse [[H7045]] be on me, [[H5921]] my son. [[H1121]] Just [[H389]] obey [[H8085]] my voice [[H6963]] and go [[H1980]] get them [[H3947]] for me.” 

### 14
So [Jacob] went [[H1980]] and got [two goats] [[H3947]] and brought [[H935]] them to his mother, [[H517]] who [[H517]] made [[H6213]] the tasty food [[H4303]] his father [[H1]] loved. [[H157]]

### 15
And Rebekah [[H7259]] took [[H3947]] the finest [[H2532]] clothes [[H899]] in the house [[H1004]] that [[H834]] belonged [[H854]] to her older [[H1419]] son [[H1121]] Esau, [[H6215]] and she put them on [[H3847]] her younger [[H6996]] son [[H1121]] Jacob. [[H3290]]

### 16
She also put [[H3847]] the skins [[H5785]] of the young [[H1423]] goats [[H5795]] on [[H5921]] his hands [[H3027]] and on [[H5921]] the smooth part [[H2513]] of his neck. [[H6677]]

### 17
Then [[H853]] she handed [[H5414]] her son [[H1121]] Jacob [[H3290]] the tasty food [[H4303]] and bread [[H3899]] she had made. [[H6213]]

### 18
So [Jacob] went [[H935]] to [[H413]] his father [[H1]] and said, [[H559]] “My father.” [[H1]] “Here I am!” [[H2009]] he answered. [[H559]] “Which one [[H4310]] are you, [[H859]] my son?” [[H1121]]

### 19
Jacob [[H3290]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] his father, [[H1]] “I [[H595]] am Esau, [[H6215]] your firstborn. [[H1060]] I have done [[H6213]] as [[H834]] you told me. [[H1696]] Please [[H4994]] sit up [[H3427]] and eat [[H398]] some of my game, [[H6718]] so that [[H5668]] you [[H5315]] may bless me.” [[H1288]]

### 20
But Isaac [[H3327]] asked [[H559]] his son, [[H1121]] “How [[H4100]] did you ever find [[H4672]] it so [[H2088]] quickly, [[H4116]] my son?” [[H1121]] “Because [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] brought [it] [[H7136]] to me,” [[H6440]] he replied. [[H559]]

### 21
Then Isaac [[H3327]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Jacob, [[H3290]] “Please [[H4994]] come closer [[H5066]] so I can touch you, [[H4184]] my son. [[H1121]] Are you [[H859]] really [[H2088]] my son [[H1121]] Esau [[H6215]] or [[H518]] not?” [[H3808]]

### 22
So Jacob [[H3290]] came close [[H5066]] to [[H413]] his father [[H1]] Isaac, [[H3327]] who touched him [[H4959]] and said, [[H559]] “The voice [[H6963]] is the voice [[H6963]] of Jacob, [[H3290]] but the hands [[H3027]] are the hands [[H3027]] of Esau.” [[H6215]]

### 23
[Isaac] did not [[H3808]] recognize him, [[H5234]] because [[H3588]] his hands [[H3027]] were [[H1961]] hairy [[H8163]] like those [[H3027]] of his brother [[H251]] Esau; [[H6215]] so he blessed him. [[H1288]]

### 24
Again he asked, [[H559]] “Are you [[H859]] really [[H2088]] my son [[H1121]] Esau?” [[H6215]] And he replied, [[H559]] “I am.” [[H589]]

### 25
“Serve me,” [[H5066]] said [Isaac], [[H559]] “and let me eat [[H398]] some of my son’s [[H1121]] game, [[H6718]] so that [[H4616]] I [[H5315]] may bless you.” [[H1288]] Jacob brought it to him, [[H5066]] and he ate; [[H398]] then he brought [[H935]] him  wine, [[H3196]] and he drank. [[H8354]]

### 26
Then his father [[H1]] Isaac [[H3327]] said [[H559]] to him, [[H413]] “Please [[H4994]] come near [[H5066]] and kiss me, [[H5401]] my son.” [[H1121]]

### 27
So he came near [[H5066]] and kissed him. [[H5401]] When Isaac smelled [[H7306]] his clothing, [[H899]] he blessed [[H1288]] him and said: [[H559]] “Ah, [[H7200]] the smell [[H7381]] of my son [[H1121]] is like the smell [[H7381]] of a field [[H7704]] that [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] has blessed. [[H1288]]

### 28
May God [[H430]] give [[H5414]] to you  the dew [[H2919]] of heaven [[H8064]] and the richness [[H4924]] of the earth— [[H776]] an abundance [[H7230]] of grain [[H1715]] and new wine. [[H8492]]

### 29
May peoples [[H5971]] serve you [[H5647]] and nations [[H3816]] bow down to you. [[H7812]] May you be [[H1933]] the master [[H1376]] of your brothers, [[H251]] and may the sons [[H1121]] of your mother [[H517]] bow down to you. [[H7812]] May those who curse you [[H779]] be cursed, [[H779]] and those who bless you [[H1288]] be blessed.” [[H1288]]

### 30
As soon as [[H834]] Isaac [[H3327]] had finished [[H3615]] blessing [[H1288]] [him] [[H3290]] and Jacob [[H3290]] had left [[H3318]] his father’s [[H1]] presence, [[H6440]] his brother [[H251]] Esau [[H6215]] returned [[H935]] from the hunt. [[H6718]]

### 31
He [[H1931]] too [[H1571]] made [[H6213]] some tasty food, [[H4303]] brought [[H935]] it to his father, [[H1]] and said [[H559]] to [him], [[H1]] “My father, [[H1]] sit up [[H6965]] and eat [[H398]] of your son’s [[H1121]] game, [[H6718]] so that [[H5668]] you [[H5315]] may bless me.” [[H1288]]

### 32
But his father [[H1]] Isaac [[H3327]] replied, [[H559]] “Who [[H4310]] are you?” [[H859]] “I [[H589]] am Esau, [[H6215]] your firstborn [[H1060]] son,” [[H1121]] he answered. [[H559]]

### 33
Isaac [[H3327]] began to tremble violently [[H2729]] and said, [[H559]] “Who [[H4310]] was it, [[H1931]] then, [[H645]] who hunted [[H6679]] the game [[H6718]] and brought it [[H935]] to me?  Before [[H2962]] you came in, [[H935]] I ate [[H398]] it all [[H3605]] and blessed him— [[H1288]] and indeed, [[H1571]] he will be [[H1961]] blessed!” [[H1288]]

### 34
When Esau [[H6215]] heard [[H8085]] his father’s [[H1]] words, [[H1697]] he let out [[H6817]] a loud [[H1419]] and bitter [[H4751]] cry [[H6818]] and said [[H559]] to his father, [[H1]] “Bless [[H1288]] me too, [[H1571]] O my father!” [[H1]]

### 35
But [Isaac] replied, [[H559]] “Your brother [[H251]] came [[H935]] deceitfully [[H4820]] and took [[H3947]] your blessing.” [[H1293]]

### 36
So [Esau] declared, [[H559]] “Is he not rightly [[H3588]] named [[H7121]] Jacob? [[H3290]] For he has cheated [[H6117]] me twice. [[H6471]] He took [[H3947]] my birthright, [[H1062]] and [[H2009]] now [[H6258]] he has taken [[H3947]] my blessing.” [[H1293]] Then he asked, [[H559]] “Haven’t [[H3808]] you saved [[H680]] a blessing for me?” [[H1293]]

### 37
But Isaac [[H3327]] answered [[H6030]] Esau: [[H6215]] “Look, [[H2005]] I have made him [[H7760]] your master [[H1376]] and [[H853]] given [[H5414]] him  all [[H3605]] his relatives [[H251]] as servants; [[H5650]] I have sustained [[H5564]] him with grain [[H1715]] and new wine. [[H8492]] What [[H4100]] is left [[H645]] that I can do for you, [[H6213]] my son?” [[H1121]]

### 38
Esau [[H6215]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] his father, [[H1]] “Do you have only one [[H259]] blessing, [[H1293]] my father? [[H1]] Bless [[H1288]] me too, [[H1571]] O my father!” [[H1]] Then Esau [[H6215]] wept [[H1058]] aloud. [[H5375]]

### 39
His father [[H1]] Isaac [[H3327]] answered him: [[H6030]] “Behold, [[H2009]] your dwelling place [[H4186]] shall be [[H1961]] away from the richness [[H4924]] of the land, [[H776]] away from the dew [[H2919]] of heaven [[H8064]] above. [[H5921]]

### 40
You shall live [[H2421]] by [[H5921]] the sword, [[H2719]] and serve [[H5647]] your brother. [[H251]] But when [[H834]] you rebel, [[H7300]] you will tear [[H6561]] his yoke [[H5923]] from [[H5921]] your neck.” [[H6677]]

### 41
Esau [[H6215]] held a grudge [[H7852]] against Jacob [[H3290]] because of [[H5921]] the blessing [[H1293]] his father [[H1]] had given him. [[H1288]] And Esau [[H6215]] said [[H559]] in his heart: [[H3820]] “The days [[H3117]] of mourning [[H60]] for my father [[H1]] are at hand; [[H7126]] then I will kill [[H2026]] my brother [[H251]] Jacob.” [[H3290]]

### 42
When the words [[H1697]] of her older [[H1419]] son [[H1121]] Esau [[H6215]] were relayed [[H5046]] to Rebekah, [[H7259]] she sent for [[H7971]] her younger [[H6996]] son [[H1121]] Jacob [[H3290]] and told [[H559]] him, [[H413]] “Look, [[H2009]] your brother [[H251]] Esau [[H6215]] is consoling [[H5162]] himself by  plotting to kill you. [[H2026]]

### 43
So now, [[H6258]] my son, [[H1121]] obey [[H8085]] my voice [[H6963]] and flee [[H1272]] at once [[H6965]] to [[H413]] my brother [[H251]] Laban [[H3837]] in Haran. [[H2771]]

### 44
Stay [[H3427]] with [[H5973]] him for a while, [[H259]] until [[H5704]] your brother’s [[H251]] fury [[H2534]] subsides— [[H7725]]

### 45
until [[H5704]] your brother’s [[H251]] rage [[H639]] against you [[H4480]] wanes [[H7725]] and he forgets [[H7911]] what [[H834]] you have done [[H6213]] to him.  Then I will send for you [[H7971]] and bring you back [[H3947]] from there. [[H8033]] Why [[H4100]] should I lose [[H7921]] both [[H1571]] of you [[H8147]] in one [[H259]] day?” [[H3117]]

### 46
Then Rebekah [[H7259]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Isaac, [[H3327]] “I am weary [[H6973]] of my life [[H2416]] because of [[H6440]] these Hittite [[H2845]] women. [[H1323]] If [[H518]] Jacob [[H3290]] takes [[H3947]] a Hittite [[H2845]] wife [[H802]] from [[H1323]] among them, [[H428]] what good [[H4100]] is my  life?” [[H2416]]
