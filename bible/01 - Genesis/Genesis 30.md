### 1
When Rachel [[H7354]] saw [[H7200]] that [[H3588]] she was not [[H3808]] bearing [[H3205]] any children [[H7354]] for Jacob, [[H3290]] she envied [[H7065]] her sister. [[H269]] “Give [[H3051]] me  children, [[H1121]] or [[H518]] I [[H595]] will die!” [[H4191]] she said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Jacob. [[H3290]]

### 2
Jacob [[H3290]] became angry [[H2734]] with Rachel [[H7354]] and said, [[H559]] “Am I [[H595]] in the place [[H8478]] of God, [[H430]] who [[H834]] has withheld [[H4513]] children [[H6529]] from you?” [[H4480]]

### 3
Then she said, [[H559]] “Here [[H2009]] is my maidservant [[H519]] Bilhah. [[H1090]] Sleep with [[H935]] her, [[H413]] and she will bear children [[H3205]] [for me], [[H1290]] so that through her [[H4480]] I [[H595]] too [[H1571]] can build a family.” [[H1129]]

### 4
So Rachel gave [[H5414]] [Jacob] [[H853]] her servant [[H8198]] Bilhah [[H1090]] as his wife, [[H802]] and [he] [[H3290]] slept with [[H935]] her, [[H413]]

### 5
and Bilhah [[H1090]] conceived [[H2029]] and bore [[H3205]] [him] [[H3290]] a son. [[H1121]]

### 6
Then Rachel [[H7354]] said, [[H559]] “God [[H430]] has vindicated me; [[H1777]] He has heard [[H8085]] my plea [[H6963]] and given [[H5414]] me  a son.” [[H1121]] So she named [[H7121]] him Dan. [[H1835]]

### 7
And Rachel’s [[H7354]] servant [[H8198]] Bilhah [[H1090]] conceived [[H2029]] again [[H5750]] and bore [[H3205]] Jacob [[H3290]] a second [[H8145]] son. [[H1121]]

### 8
Then Rachel [[H7354]] said, [[H559]] “In my great struggles, [[H5319]] I have wrestled [[H6617]] with [[H5973]] my sister [[H269]] and [[H1571]] won.” [[H3201]] So she named [[H7121]] him [[H8034]] Naphtali. [[H5321]]

### 9
When Leah [[H3812]] saw [[H7200]] that [[H3588]] she had stopped [[H5975]] having children, [[H3205]] she gave [[H5414]] her servant [[H8198]] Zilpah [[H2153]] to Jacob [[H3290]] as a wife. [[H802]]

### 10
And Leah’s [[H3812]] servant [[H8198]] Zilpah [[H2153]] bore [[H3205]] Jacob [[H3290]] a son. [[H1121]]

### 11
Then Leah [[H3812]] said, [[H559]] “How fortunate!” [[H1409]] So she named [[H7121]] him Gad. [[H1410]]

### 12
When Leah’s [[H3812]] servant [[H8198]] Zilpah [[H2153]] bore [[H3205]] Jacob [[H3290]] a second [[H8145]] son, [[H1121]]

### 13
Leah [[H3812]] said, [[H559]] “How happy I am, [[H837]] for [[H3588]] the women [[H1323]] will call me happy.” [[H833]] So she named [[H7121]] him [[H8034]] Asher. [[H836]]

### 14
Now during the wheat [[H2406]] harvest, [[H7105]] Reuben [[H7205]] went out [[H1980]] and found [[H4672]] some mandrakes [[H1736]] in the field. [[H7704]] When he brought [[H935]] them to [[H413]] his mother, [[H517]] Rachel [[H7354]] begged [[H559]] Leah, [[H3812]] “Please [[H4994]] give me [[H5414]] some of  your son’s [[H1121]] mandrakes.” [[H1736]]

### 15
But Leah replied, [[H559]] “Is it not enough [[H4592]] that you have taken away [[H3947]] my husband? [[H582]] Now you [[H1571]] want to take [[H3947]] my son’s [[H1121]] mandrakes [as well]?” [[H1736]] “Very well,” [[H3651]] said [[H559]] Rachel, [[H7354]] “he may sleep [[H7901]] with you [[H5973]] tonight [[H3915]] in exchange for [[H8478]] your son’s [[H1121]] mandrakes.” [[H1736]]

### 16
When Jacob [[H3290]] came in [[H935]] from [[H4480]] the field [[H7704]] that evening, [[H6153]] Leah [[H3812]] went out [[H3318]] to meet him [[H7125]] and said, [[H559]] “You must come [[H935]] with me, [[H413]] for [[H3588]] I have hired you [[H7936]] with my son’s [[H1121]] mandrakes.” [[H1736]] So [he] slept [[H7901]] with [[H5973]] her that [[H1931]] night. [[H3915]]

### 17
And God [[H430]] listened [[H8085]] to [[H413]] Leah, [[H3812]] and she conceived [[H2029]] and bore [[H3205]] a fifth [[H2549]] son [[H1121]] to Jacob. [[H3290]]

### 18
Then Leah [[H3812]] said, [[H559]] “God [[H430]] has rewarded [[H5414]] me for [[H834]] giving [[H5414]] my maidservant [[H8198]] to my husband.” [[H376]] So she named him [[H7121]] Issachar. [[H3485]]

### 19
Again [[H5750]] Leah [[H3812]] conceived [[H2029]] and bore [[H3205]] a sixth [[H8345]] son [[H1121]] to Jacob. [[H3290]]

### 20
“God [[H430]] has given [[H2064]] me a good [[H2896]] gift,” [[H2065]] [she] [[H3812]] said. [[H559]] “This time [[H6471]] my husband [[H376]] will honor me, [[H2082]] because [[H3588]] I have borne [[H3205]] him  six [[H8337]] sons.” [[H1121]] And she named [[H7121]] him Zebulun. [[H2074]]

### 21
After that, [[H310]] Leah gave birth to [[H3205]] a daughter [[H1323]] and named [[H7121]] her Dinah. [[H1783]]

### 22
Then God [[H430]] remembered [[H2142]] Rachel. [[H7354]] He [[H430]] listened [[H8085]] to [[H413]] her and opened [[H6605]] her womb, [[H7358]]

### 23
and she conceived [[H2029]] and gave birth to [[H3205]] a son. [[H1121]] “God [[H430]] has taken away [[H622]] my shame,” [[H2781]] she said. [[H559]]

### 24
She named [[H7121]] him Joseph, [[H3130]] and said, [[H559]] “May the LORD [[H3068]] add [[H3254]] to me  another [[H312]] son.” [[H1121]]

### 25
Now [[H1961]] after [[H834]] Rachel [[H7354]] had given birth to [[H3205]] Joseph, [[H3130]] Jacob [[H3290]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Laban, [[H3837]] “Send me on my way [[H7971]] so I can return [[H1980]] to [[H413]] my homeland. [[H4725]]

### 26
Give [[H5414]] [me] [[H853]] my wives [[H802]] and [[H853]] children, [[H3206]] for whom [[H834]] I have served you, [[H5647]] and I will go on my way. [[H1980]] You [[H859]] know [[H3045]] how [[H834]] hard I have worked [[H5656]] for you.” [[H5647]]

### 27
But Laban [[H3837]] replied, [[H559]] “If [[H518]] I have found [[H4672]] favor [[H2580]] in your eyes, [[H5869]] please stay. [[H4994]] I have learned by divination [[H5172]] that the LORD [[H3068]] has blessed [[H1288]] me because of you.” [[H1558]]

### 28
And he added, [[H559]] “Name [[H5344]] your wages, [[H7939]] and I will pay them.” [[H5414]]

### 29
Then [Jacob] answered, [[H559]] “You [[H859]] know [[H3045]] how [[H834]] I have served you [[H5647]] and [[H853]] how [well] [[H834]] your livestock [[H4735]] has fared [[H1961]] under my care. [[H854]]

### 30
Indeed, [[H3588]] you had [[H1961]] very little [[H4592]] before my arrival, [[H6440]] but now your wealth [[H7230]] has increased many times over. [[H6555]] The LORD [[H3068]] has blessed [[H1288]] you [[H853]] wherever I set foot. [[H7272]] But now, [[H6258]] when [[H4970]] may I [[H595]] also [[H1571]] provide [[H6213]] for my own household?” [[H1004]]

### 31
“What [[H4100]] can I give [[H5414]] you?”  Laban asked. [[H559]] “You do not [[H3808]] need to give [[H5414]] me  anything,” [[H3972]] Jacob replied. [[H3290]] “If [[H518]] you do [[H6213]] this [[H2088]] one thing [[H1697]] for me,  I will keep on [[H7725]] shepherding [[H7462]] and keeping [[H8104]] your flock. [[H6629]]

### 32
Let me go [[H5674]] through all [[H3605]] your flocks [[H6629]] today [[H3117]] and remove [[H5493]] from them [[H8033]] every [[H3605]] speckled [[H5348]] or spotted [[H2921]] sheep, [[H7716]] every [[H3605]] dark-colored [[H2345]] lamb, [[H3775]] and every spotted [[H2921]] or speckled [[H5348]] goat. [[H5795]] These will be [[H1961]] my wages. [[H7939]]

### 33
So my honesty [[H6666]] will testify [[H6030]] for me  when [[H3588]] you come to check [[H935]] on [[H5921]] my wages [[H7939]] in the future. [[H3117]] If I have [[H854]] any [[H3605]] goats [[H5795]] that [[H834]] are not [[H369]] speckled [[H5348]] or spotted, [[H2921]] or any lambs [[H3775]] that are not dark-colored, [[H2345]] they [[H1931]] will be considered stolen.” [[H1589]]

### 34
“Agreed,” [[H2005]] said [[H559]] Laban. [[H3837]] “Let it be [[H1961]] as you have said.” [[H1697]]

### 35
That very [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] Laban removed [[H5493]] all the streaked [[H6124]] or spotted [[H2921]] male goats [[H8495]] and [[H853]] every [[H3605]] speckled [[H5348]] or spotted [[H2921]] female goat— [[H5795]] every one [[H3605]] that [[H834]] had any white [[H3836]] on it—  and every [[H3605]] dark-colored [[H2345]] lamb, [[H3775]] and he placed them [[H5414]] under the care [[H3027]] of his sons. [[H1121]]

### 36
Then he put [[H7760]] a three-day [[H7969]] journey [[H1870]] between [[H996]] himself and Jacob, [[H3290]] while Jacob [[H3290]] was shepherding [[H7462]] the rest [[H3498]] of Laban’s [[H3837]] flocks. [[H6629]]

### 37
Jacob, however, [[H3290]] took [[H3947]] fresh [[H3892]] branches [[H4731]] of poplar, [[H3839]] almond, [[H3869]] and plane trees, [[H6196]] and peeled [[H6478]] [the bark],  exposing [[H4286]] the white [[H3836]] inner wood [[H6479]] of [[H5921]] the branches. [[H4731]]

### 38
Then he set [[H3322]] the peeled [[H6478]] branches [[H4731]] in the watering [[H4325]] troughs [[H8268]] in front of [[H5227]] the flocks [[H6629]] coming in [[H935]] to drink. [[H8354]] So when the flocks [[H6629]] were in heat [[H3179]] and came [[H935]] to drink, [[H8354]]

### 39
they [[H6629]] mated [[H3179]] in front of [[H413]] the branches. [[H4731]] And they bore [[H3205]] young [that were] [[H6629]] streaked [[H6124]] or speckled [[H5348]] or spotted. [[H2921]]

### 40
Jacob [[H3290]] set apart [[H6504]] the young, [[H3775]] but made [[H5414]] the [rest] [[H6629]] face [[H6440]] the streaked [[H6124]] dark-colored [[H2345]] sheep in Laban’s [[H3837]] flocks. [[H6629]] Then he set [[H7896]] his own stock [[H5739]] apart [[H905]] and did not [[H3808]] put [[H7896]] them with [[H5921]] Laban’s [[H3837]] animals. [[H6629]]

### 41
Whenever [[H3605]] the stronger females [[H7194]] of the flock [[H6629]] were in heat, [[H3179]] Jacob [[H3290]] would place [[H7760]] the branches [[H4731]] in the troughs, [[H7298]] in full view [[H5869]] of the animals, [[H6629]] so they would breed [[H3179]] in front of the branches. [[H4731]]

### 42
But if the animals [[H6629]] were weak, [[H5848]] he did not [[H3808]] set out the branches. [[H7760]] So the weaker animals [[H5848]] went to [[H1961]] Laban [[H3837]] and the stronger ones [[H7194]] to Jacob. [[H3290]]

### 43
Thus [Jacob] [[H376]] became [[H3966]] exceedingly [[H3966]] prosperous. [[H6555]] He owned [[H1961]] large [[H7227]] flocks, [[H6629]] maidservants [[H8198]] and menservants, [[H5650]] and camels [[H1581]] and donkeys. [[H2543]]
