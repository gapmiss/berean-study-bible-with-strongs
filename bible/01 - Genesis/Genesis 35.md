###### 1
Then God [[H430]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Jacob, [[H3290]] “Arise, [[H6965]] go up [[H5927]] to  Bethel, [[H1008]] and settle [[H3427]] there. [[H8033]] Build [[H6213]] an altar [[H4196]] there [[H8033]] to the God [[H410]] who appeared [[H7200]] to [[H413]] you when you fled [[H1272]] from [[H6440]] your brother [[H251]] Esau.” [[H6215]]

###### 2
So Jacob [[H3290]] told [[H559]] his household [[H1004]] and all [[H3605]] who [[H834]] were with him, [[H5973]] “Get rid of [[H5493]] the foreign [[H5236]] gods [[H430]] that [[H834]] are among you. [[H8432]] Purify yourselves [[H2891]] and change [[H2498]] your garments. [[H8071]]

###### 3
Then let us arise [[H6965]] and go [[H5927]] to  Bethel. [[H1008]] I will build [[H6213]] an altar [[H4196]] there [[H8033]] to the God [[H410]] who answered [[H6030]] me in my day [[H3117]] of distress. [[H6869]] He has been [[H1961]] with me [[H5978]] wherever [[H1870]] I have gone.” [[H1980]]

###### 4
So they gave [[H5414]] Jacob [[H3290]] all [[H3605]] their [[H834]] foreign [[H5236]] gods [[H430]] and [all their] earrings, [[H5141]] and Jacob [[H3290]] buried [[H2934]] them under [[H8478]] the oak [[H424]] near [[H5973]] Shechem. [[H7927]]

###### 5
As they set out, [[H5265]] a terror [[H2847]] from God [[H430]] fell [[H1961]] over [[H5921]] the surrounding [[H5439]] cities, [[H5892]] so that they did not [[H3808]] pursue [[H7291]] Jacob’s [[H3290]] sons. [[H1121]]

###### 6
So Jacob [[H3290]] and everyone [[H3605]] with him [[H5973]] arrived [[H935]] in Luz [[H3870]] (that is, [[H1931]] Bethel) [[H1008]] in the land [[H776]] of Canaan. [[H3667]]

###### 7
There [[H8033]] Jacob built [[H1129]] an altar, [[H4196]] and he called [[H7121]] that place [[H4725]] El-bethel, [[H410]] because [[H3588]] it was there [[H8033]] that God [[H430]] had revealed Himself [[H1540]] to him [[H413]] as he fled [[H1272]] from [[H6440]] his brother. [[H251]]

###### 8
Now Deborah, [[H1683]] Rebekah’s [[H7259]] nurse, [[H3243]] died [[H4191]] and was buried [[H6912]] under [[H8478]] the oak [[H437]] below [[H8478]] Bethel. [[H1008]] So [Jacob] named [[H7121]] [it] [[H8034]] Allon-bachuth. [[H439]]

###### 9
After [Jacob] had returned [[H935]] from  Paddan-aram, [[H6307]] God [[H430]] appeared [[H7200]] to [[H413]] [him] [[H3290]] again [[H5750]] and blessed [[H1288]] him. [[H853]]

###### 10
And God [[H430]] said [[H559]] to him,  “Your name [[H8034]] is Jacob; [[H3290]] you will no [[H3808]] longer [[H5750]] be called [[H7121]] Jacob, [[H3290]] but [[H3588]] your name [[H8034]] will be [[H1961]] Israel.” [[H3478]] So [God] named [[H7121]] him Israel. [[H3478]]

###### 11
And God [[H430]] told [[H559]] him,  “I [[H589]] am God [[H410]] Almighty. [[H7706]] Be fruitful [[H6509]] and multiply. [[H7235]] A nation— [[H1471]] even a company [[H6951]] of nations— [[H1471]] shall come [[H1961]] from you, [[H4480]] and kings [[H4428]] shall descend [[H3318]] from you. [[H2504]]

###### 12
The land [[H776]] that [[H834]] I gave [[H5414]] to Abraham [[H85]] and Isaac [[H3327]] I will give [[H5414]] to you,  and I will give [[H5414]] this land [[H776]] to your descendants [[H2233]] after you.” [[H310]]

###### 13
Then God [[H430]] went up [[H5927]] from him [[H5921]] at the place [[H4725]] where [[H834]] He had spoken [[H1696]] with him. [[H854]]

###### 14
So Jacob [[H3290]] set up [[H5324]] a pillar [[H4676]] in the place [[H4725]] where [[H834]] [God] had spoken [[H1696]] to him— [[H854]] a stone [[H68]] marker— [[H4678]] and he poured out [[H5258]] a drink offering [[H5262]] on it [[H5921]] and anointed it [[H3332]] with oil. [[H8081]]

###### 15
Jacob [[H3290]] called [[H7121]] the place [[H4725]] where [[H834]] God [[H430]] had spoken [[H1696]] with [[H854]] him Bethel. [[H1008]]

###### 16
Later, they set out [[H5265]] from  Bethel, [[H1008]] and while they were [[H1961]] still [[H5750]] some distance [[H3530]] from Ephrath, [[H672]] Rachel [[H7354]] began to give birth, [[H3205]] and her labor [[H3205]] was difficult. [[H7185]]

###### 17
During [[H1961]] her severe [[H7185]] labor, [[H3205]] the midwife [[H3205]] said [[H559]] to her,  “Do not [[H408]] be afraid, [[H3372]] for [[H3588]] you  are having [[H2088]] another [[H1571]] son.” [[H1121]]

###### 18
And [[H1961]] with her last breath— [[H3318]] for [[H3588]] she was dying— [[H4191]] she named [[H7121]] him Ben-oni. [[H1126]] But his father [[H1]] called [[H7121]] him  Benjamin. [[H1144]]

###### 19
So Rachel [[H7354]] died [[H4191]] and was buried [[H6912]] on the way [[H1870]] to Ephrath [[H672]] (that is, [[H1931]] Bethlehem). [[H1035]]

###### 20
Jacob [[H3290]] set up [[H5324]] a pillar [[H4676]] on her [[H5921]] grave; [[H6900]] it [[H1931]] marks [[H4678]] Rachel’s [[H7354]] tomb [[H6900]] to [[H5704]] this day. [[H3117]]

###### 21
Israel again [[H3478]] set out [[H5265]] and pitched [[H5186]] his tent [[H168]] beyond [[H1973]] the Tower of Eder. [[H4029]]

###### 22
While [[H1961]] Israel [[H3478]] was living [[H7931]] in that [[H1931]] region, [[H776]] Reuben [[H7205]] went in [[H1980]] and slept with [[H7901]] his father’s [[H1]] concubine [[H6370]] Bilhah, [[H1090]] and Israel [[H3478]] heard about it. [[H8085]] Jacob had [[H3290]] twelve [[H8147]] sons: [[H1121]]

###### 23
The sons [[H1121]] of Leah [[H3812]] were Reuben [[H7205]] the firstborn [[H1060]] of Jacob, [[H3290]] Simeon, [[H8095]] Levi, [[H3878]] Judah, [[H3063]] Issachar, [[H3485]] and Zebulun. [[H2074]]

###### 24
The sons [[H1121]] of Rachel [were] [[H7354]] Joseph [[H3130]] and Benjamin. [[H1144]]

###### 25
The sons [[H1121]] of Rachel’s [[H7354]] maidservant [[H8198]] Bilhah [were] [[H1090]] Dan [[H1835]] and Naphtali. [[H5321]]

###### 26
And the sons [[H1121]] of Leah’s [[H3812]] maidservant [[H8198]] Zilpah [[H2153]] [were] Gad [[H1410]] and Asher. [[H836]] These [[H428]] are the sons [[H1121]] of Jacob, [[H3290]] who [[H834]] were born [[H3205]] to him  in  Paddan-aram. [[H6307]]

###### 27
Jacob [[H3290]] returned [[H935]] to [[H413]] his father [[H1]] Isaac [[H3327]] at Mamre, [[H4471]] near Kiriath-arba [[H7153]] (that is, [[H1931]] Hebron), [[H2275]] where [[H834]] Abraham [[H85]] and Isaac [[H3327]] had dwelt. [[H1481]]

###### 28
And Isaac [[H3327]] lived [[H1961]] 180 [[H3967]] years. [[H8141]]

###### 29
Then [he] [[H3327]] breathed his last [[H1478]] and died [[H4191]] and was gathered [[H622]] to [[H413]] his people, [[H5971]] old [[H2205]] and full [[H7649]] of years. [[H3117]] And his sons [[H1121]] Esau [[H6215]] and Jacob [[H3290]] buried him. [[H6912]]
