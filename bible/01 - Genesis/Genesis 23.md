### 1
Now [[H1961]] Sarah [[H8283]] lived to be [[H2416]] 127 [[H3967]] years [[H8141]] old. [[H8141]]

### 2
[She] [[H8283]] died [[H4191]] in Kiriath-arba [[H7153]] (that is, [[H1931]] Hebron) [[H2275]] in the land [[H776]] of Canaan, [[H3667]] and Abraham [[H85]] went out [[H935]] to mourn [[H5594]] and to weep [[H1058]] for [her]. [[H8283]]

### 3
Then Abraham [[H85]] got up [[H6965]] from [[H5921]] beside [[H6440]] his dead wife [[H4191]] and said [[H1696]] to [[H413]] the Hittites, [[H1121]]

### 4
“I [[H595]] am a stranger [[H1616]] and an outsider [[H8453]] among you. [[H5973]] Give [[H5414]] me  a burial [[H6913]] site [[H272]] among you [[H5973]] so that I can bury [[H6912]] my dead.” [[H4191]]

### 5
The Hittites [[H1121]] replied [[H6030]] to Abraham, [[H85]]

### 6
“Listen to us, [[H8085]] sir. [[H113]] You [[H859]] are God’s [[H430]] chosen one [[H5387]] among us. [[H8432]] Bury [[H6912]] your dead [[H4191]] in the finest [[H4005]] of our tombs. [[H6913]] None [[H3808]] of us [[H4480]] will withhold [[H3607]] his tomb [[H6913]] for burying [[H6912]] your dead.” [[H4191]]

### 7
Then Abraham [[H85]] rose [[H6965]] and bowed down [[H7812]] before the people [[H5971]] of the land, [[H776]] the Hittites. [[H1121]]

### 8
“If [[H518]] you are willing [[H5315]] for me to bury [[H6912]] my dead,” [[H4191]] he said [[H1696]] to them, [[H854]] “listen to me, [[H8085]] and approach [[H6293]] Ephron [[H6085]] son [[H1121]] of Zohar [[H6714]] on my behalf 

### 9
to sell [[H5414]] me  the cave [[H4631]] of Machpelah [[H4375]] that belongs to him; [[H834]] it [[H834]] is at the end [[H7097]] of his field. [[H7704]] Let him sell it [[H5414]] to me  in your presence [[H8432]] for full [[H4392]] price, [[H3701]] so that [I may have] a burial [[H6913]] site.” [[H272]]

### 10
Now Ephron [[H6085]] was sitting [[H3427]] among [[H8432]] the sons [[H1121]] of Heth. [[H2845]] So in the presence [[H241]] of all [[H3605]] the Hittites [[H1121]] who had come [[H935]] to the gate [[H8179]] of his city, [[H5892]] Ephron [[H6085]] the Hittite [[H2850]] answered [[H6030]] Abraham, [[H85]]

### 11
“No, [[H3808]] my lord. [[H113]] Listen to me. [[H8085]] I give [[H5414]] you the field, [[H7704]] and I give [[H5414]] you the cave [[H4631]] that is in it. [[H834]] I give it [[H5414]] to you  in the presence [[H5869]] of my people. [[H1121]] Bury [[H6912]] your dead.” [[H4191]]

### 12
Again Abraham [[H85]] bowed down [[H7812]] before [[H6440]] the people [[H5971]] of the land [[H776]]

### 13
and said [[H1696]] to [[H413]] Ephron [[H6085]] in their presence, [[H241]] “If [[H518]] you [[H859]] will please [[H3863]] listen to me, [[H8085]] I will pay you [[H5414]] the price [[H3701]] of the field. [[H7704]] Accept [[H3947]] it from me, [[H4480]] so that I may bury [[H6912]] my dead [[H4191]] there.” [[H8033]]

### 14
Ephron [[H6085]] answered [[H6030]] Abraham, [[H85]]

### 15
“Listen to me, [[H8085]] my lord. [[H113]] The land [[H776]] [is worth] four [[H702]] hundred [[H3967]] shekels [[H8255]] of silver, [[H3701]] but what [[H4100]] is that [[H1931]] between you and me? [[H996]] Bury [[H6912]] your dead.” [[H4191]]

### 16
Abraham [[H85]] agreed [[H8085]] to [[H413]] Ephron’s terms [[H6085]] and [[H85]] weighed out [[H8254]] [for him] [[H6085]] the price [[H3701]] he had named [[H1696]] in the hearing [[H241]] of the Hittites: [[H1121]] four [[H702]] hundred [[H3967]] shekels [[H8255]] of silver, [[H3701]] according to the standard [[H5674]] of the merchants. [[H5503]]

### 17
So Ephron’s [[H6085]] field [[H7704]] at Machpelah [[H4375]] near [[H6440]] Mamre, [[H4471]] the cave [[H4631]] that was [[H834]] in it,  and all [[H3605]] the trees [[H6086]] within [[H3605]] the boundaries [[H1366]] of the field, [[H7704]] were deeded over [[H6965]]

### 18
to Abraham’s [[H85]] possession [[H4736]] in the presence [[H5869]] of all [[H3605]] the Hittites [[H1121]] who had come [[H935]] to the gate [[H8179]] of his city. [[H5892]]

### 19
After [[H310]] this, [[H3651]] Abraham [[H85]] buried [[H6912]] his wife [[H802]] Sarah [[H8283]] in [[H413]] the cave [[H4631]] of the field [[H7704]] at Machpelah [[H4375]] near [[H5921]] Mamre [[H4471]] (that is, [[H1931]] Hebron) [[H2275]] in the land [[H776]] of Canaan. [[H3667]]

### 20
So the field [[H7704]] and its [[H834]] cave [[H4631]] were deeded [[H6965]] by the Hittites [[H1121]] to Abraham [[H85]] as a burial [[H6913]] site. [[H272]]
