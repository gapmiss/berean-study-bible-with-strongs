###### 1
Jacob also [[H3290]] went [[H1980]] on his way, [[H1870]] and the angels [[H4397]] of God [[H430]] met him. [[H6293]]

###### 2
When [[H834]] [Jacob] saw them, [[H7200]] [he] [[H3290]] said, [[H559]] “This [[H2088]] is the camp [[H4264]] of God.” [[H430]] So he named [[H7121]] that [[H1931]] place [[H4725]] Mahanaim. [[H4266]]

###### 3
Jacob [[H3290]] sent [[H7971]] messengers [[H4397]] ahead of [[H6440]] him to [[H413]] his brother [[H251]] Esau [[H6215]] in the land [[H776]] of Seir, [[H8165]] the country [[H7704]] of Edom. [[H123]]

###### 4
He instructed them, [[H6680]] “You are to say [[H559]] to my master [[H113]] Esau, [[H6215]] ‘Your servant [[H5650]] Jacob [[H3290]] says: [[H559]] I have been staying [[H1481]] with [[H5973]] Laban [[H3837]] and have remained there [[H309]] until [[H5704]] now. [[H6258]]

###### 5
I have [[H1961]] oxen, [[H7794]] donkeys, [[H2543]] flocks, [[H6629]] menservants, [[H5650]] and maidservants. [[H8198]] I have sent [[H7971]] this message to inform [[H5046]] my master, [[H113]] so that I may find [[H4672]] favor [[H2580]] in your sight.’” [[H5869]]

###### 6
When the messengers [[H4397]] returned [[H7725]] to [[H413]] Jacob, [[H3290]] they said, [[H559]] “We went [[H935]] to [[H413]] your brother [[H251]] Esau; [[H6215]] he is coming [[H1980]] to meet you— [[H7125]] he and four [[H702]] hundred [[H3967]] men [[H376]] with him.” [[H5973]]

###### 7
In great [[H3966]] fear [[H3372]] and distress, [[H3334]] Jacob [[H3290]] divided [[H2673]] his [[H854]] people [[H5971]] into two [[H8147]] camps, [[H4264]] as well as the flocks [[H6629]] and herds [[H1241]] and camels. [[H1581]]

###### 8
He thought, [[H559]] “If [[H518]] Esau [[H6215]] comes [[H935]] and attacks [[H5221]] one [[H259]] camp, [[H4264]] then [[H1961]] the other [[H7604]] camp [[H4264]] can escape.” [[H6413]]

###### 9
Then Jacob [[H3290]] declared, [[H559]] “O God [[H430]] of my father [[H1]] Abraham, [[H85]] God [[H430]] of my father [[H1]] Isaac, [[H3327]] the LORD [[H3068]] who told [[H559]] me, [[H413]] ‘Go back [[H7725]] to your country [[H776]] and to your kindred, [[H4138]] and I will make you prosper,’ [[H3190]]

###### 10
I am unworthy [[H6994]] of all [[H3605]] the kindness [[H2617]] and faithfulness [[H571]] You have shown [[H6213]] Your servant. [[H5650]] Indeed, [[H3588]] with only my staff [[H4731]] I came across [[H5674]] the [[H2088]] Jordan, [[H3383]] but now [[H6258]] I have become [[H1961]] two [[H8147]] camps. [[H4264]]

###### 11
Please [[H4994]] deliver me [[H5337]] from the hand [[H3027]] of my brother [[H251]] Esau, [[H6215]] for [[H3588]] I [[H595]] am afraid that [[H3373]] he may come [[H935]] and attack me, [[H5221]] and also the mothers [[H517]] and [[H5921]] their children [with me]. [[H1121]]

###### 12
But You [[H859]] have said, [[H559]] ‘I will surely [[H3190]] make you prosper, [[H3190]] and I will make [[H7760]] your offspring [[H2233]] like the sand [[H2344]] of the sea, [[H3220]] too numerous [[H7230]] to count.’” [[H5608]]

###### 13
[Jacob] spent [[H3885]] the [[H1931]] night [[H3915]] there, [[H8033]] and from what he had brought [[H935]] with him, [[H3027]] he selected [[H3947]] a gift [[H4503]] for his brother [[H251]] Esau: [[H6215]]

###### 14
200 [[H3967]] female goats, [[H5795]] 20 [[H6242]] male goats, [[H8495]] 200 [[H3967]] ewes, [[H7353]] 20 [[H6242]] rams, [[H352]]

###### 15
30 [[H7970]] milk [[H3243]] camels [[H1581]] with their young, [[H1121]] 40 [[H705]] cows, [[H6510]] 10 [[H6235]] bulls, [[H6499]] 20 [[H6242]] female donkeys, [[H860]] and 10 [[H6235]] male donkeys. [[H5895]]

###### 16
He entrusted them to [[H5414]] his servants [[H5650]] in separate [[H905]] herds [[H5739]] and told [[H559]] them, [[H5650]] “Go on [[H5674]] ahead of me, [[H6440]] and keep [[H7760]] some distance [[H7305]] between [[H996]] the herds.” [[H5739]]

###### 17
He instructed [[H6680]] the one in the lead, [[H7223]] “When [[H3588]] my brother [[H251]] Esau [[H6215]] meets [[H6298]] you and asks, [[H7592]] ‘To whom [[H4310]] do you belong, [[H859]] where [[H575]] are you going, [[H1980]] and whose [[H4310]] animals are these [[H428]] before you?’ [[H6440]]

###### 18
then you are to say, [[H559]] ‘They belong to your servant [[H5650]] Jacob. [[H3290]] They [[H1931]] are a gift, [[H4503]] sent [[H7971]] to my lord [[H113]] Esau. [[H6215]] And behold, [[H2009]] [Jacob] [[H1931]] is behind us.’” [[H310]]

###### 19
He also [[H1571]] instructed [[H6680]] the second, [[H8145]] the third, [[H7992]] and [[H1571]] all those [[H3605]] following [[H1980]] behind [[H310]] the herds: [[H5739]] “When you meet [[H4672]] Esau, [[H6215]] you are to say [[H1696]] the same [[H2088]] thing [[H1697]] to [[H413]] him. [[H853]]

###### 20
You are also [[H1571]] to say, [[H559]] ‘Look, [[H2009]] your servant [[H5650]] Jacob [[H3290]] is right behind us.’” [[H310]] For [[H3588]] he thought, [[H559]] “I will appease [[H3722]] [Esau] [[H6440]] with the gift [[H4503]] that is going [[H1980]] before me. [[H6440]] After [[H310]] that [[H3651]] I can face [[H7200]] him, [[H6440]] and perhaps [[H194]] he will accept [[H5375]] me.” [[H6440]]

###### 21
So [Jacob’s] gifts [[H4503]] went [[H5674]] on before [[H5921]] him, [[H6440]] while he [[H1931]] spent [[H3885]] the [[H1931]] night [[H3915]] in the camp. [[H4264]]

###### 22
During the night [[H3915]] Jacob got up [[H6965]] and took [[H3947]] his two [[H8147]] wives, [[H802]] his two [[H8147]] maidservants, [[H8198]] and his eleven [[H259]] sons, [[H3206]] and crossed [[H5674]] the ford [[H4569]] of Jabbok. [[H2999]]

###### 23
He took [[H3947]] them and sent them across [[H5674]] the stream, [[H5158]] along with all his possessions. [[H834]]

###### 24
So Jacob [[H3290]] was left [[H3498]] all alone, [[H905]] and [there] a man [[H582]] wrestled [[H79]] with him [[H5973]] until [[H5704]] daybreak. [[H5927]]

###### 25
When the man saw [[H7200]] that [[H3588]] He could not [[H3808]] overpower [Jacob], [[H3201]] He struck [[H5060]] the socket [[H3709]] of Jacob’s hip [[H3409]] and dislocated [[H3363]] [it] [[H3290]] as they [[H5973]] wrestled. [[H79]]

###### 26
Then [the man] said, [[H559]] “Let Me go, [[H7971]] for [[H3588]] it is daybreak.” [[H5927]] But Jacob replied, [[H559]] “I will not [[H3808]] let You go [[H7971]] unless [[H3588]] You bless me.” [[H1288]]

###### 27
“What [[H4100]] is your name?” [[H8034]] the man asked. [[H559]] “Jacob,” [[H3290]] he replied. [[H559]]

###### 28
Then [the man] said, [[H559]] “Your name [[H8034]] will no [[H3808]] longer [[H5750]] be [[H559]] Jacob, [[H3290]] but Israel, [[H3478]] because [[H3588]] you have struggled [[H8280]] with [[H5973]] God [[H430]] and with [[H5973]] men, [[H376]] and you have prevailed.” [[H3201]]

###### 29
Then Jacob [[H3290]] asked him, [[H7592]] “Please [[H4994]] tell [[H5046]] me Your name.” [[H8034]] “Why [[H4100]] do you ask [[H7592]] My name?” [[H8034]] he replied. [[H559]] And He blessed [[H1288]] [Jacob] there. [[H8033]]

###### 30
So Jacob [[H3290]] named [[H7121]] the place [[H4725]] Peniel, [[H6439]] saying, “Indeed, [[H3588]] I have seen [[H7200]] God [[H430]] face [[H6440]] to [[H413]] face, [[H6440]] and yet my life [[H5315]] was spared.” [[H5337]]

###### 31
The sun [[H8121]] rose [[H2224]] above him  as [[H834]] he passed by [[H5674]] Penuel, [[H6439]] and he [[H1931]] was limping [[H6760]] because of [[H5921]] his hip. [[H3409]]

###### 32
Therefore [[H5921]] to [[H5704]] this [[H2088]] day [[H3117]] the Israelites [[H1121]] do not [[H3808]] eat [[H398]] the tendon [[H1517]] at [[H5921]] the hip [[H3409]] socket, [[H3709]] because [[H3588]] [the man] struck [[H5060]] Jacob’s [[H3290]] hip [[H3409]] socket [[H3709]] near that tendon.
