###### 1
Some time later, [[H310]] the king’s [[H4428]] cupbearer [[H4945]] and baker [[H644]] offended [[H2398]] their master, [[H113]] the king [[H4428]] of Egypt. [[H4714]]

###### 2
Pharaoh [[H6547]] was angry [[H7107]] with [[H5921]] his two [[H8147]] officers, [[H5631]] the chief [[H8269]] cupbearer [[H4945]] and the chief [[H8269]] baker, [[H644]]

###### 3
and imprisoned them [[H5414]] in the house [[H1004]] of the captain [[H8269]] of the guard, [[H2876]] the same prison [[H1004]] where [[H834]] Joseph [[H3130]] was confined. [[H631]]

###### 4
The captain [[H8269]] of the guard [[H2876]] assigned [[H6485]] them [[H854]] to Joseph, [[H3130]] and he became their personal attendant. [[H8334]] After they had been [[H1961]] in custody [[H4929]] for some time, [[H3117]]

###### 5
both [[H8147]] of these men— [[H582]] the Egyptian [[H4714]] king’s [[H4428]] cupbearer [[H4945]] and baker, [[H644]] who [[H834]] were being held [[H631]] in the prison— [[H1004]] had a dream [[H2492]] on the same [[H259]] night, [[H3915]] and each dream [[H2472]] had its own meaning. [[H6623]]

###### 6
When Joseph [[H3130]] came [[H935]] to [[H413]] them in the morning, [[H1242]] he saw [[H7200]] that they looked distraught. [[H2196]]

###### 7
So he asked [[H7592]] Pharaoh’s [[H6547]] officials [[H5631]] who [[H834]] were in custody [[H4929]] with him [[H854]] in his master’s [[H113]] house, [[H1004]] “Why [[H4069]] are your faces [[H6440]] so downcast [[H7451]] today?” [[H3117]]

###### 8
“We both had dreams,” [[H2472]] they replied, [[H559]] “but there is no one [[H369]] to interpret them.” [[H6622]] Then Joseph [[H3130]] said [[H559]] to them, [[H413]] “Don’t [[H3808]] interpretations [[H6623]] belong to God? [[H430]] Tell me your dreams.” [[H5608]]

###### 9
So the chief [[H8269]] cupbearer [[H4945]] told [[H5608]] Joseph [[H3130]] his dream: [[H2472]] “In my dream [[H2472]] there [[H2009]] was a vine [[H1612]] before me, [[H6440]]

###### 10
and on the vine [[H1612]] were three [[H7969]] branches. [[H8299]] As it [[H1931]] budded, [[H6524]] its blossoms [[H5322]] opened [[H5927]] and its clusters [[H811]] ripened [[H1310]] into grapes. [[H6025]]

###### 11
Pharaoh’s [[H6547]] cup [[H3563]] was in my hand, [[H3027]] and I took [[H3947]] the grapes, [[H6025]] squeezed [[H7818]] them into [[H413]] [his] [[H6547]] cup, [[H3563]] and placed [[H5414]] the cup [[H3563]] into [[H5921]] [his] [[H6547]] hand.” [[H3709]]

###### 12
Joseph [[H3130]] replied, [[H559]] “This [is] [[H2088]] the interpretation: [[H6623]] The three [[H7969]] branches [[H8299]] are three [[H7969]] days. [[H3117]]

###### 13
Within [[H5750]] three [[H7969]] days [[H3117]] Pharaoh [[H6547]] will lift up [[H5375]] your head [[H7218]] and restore [[H7725]] your [[H5921]] position. [[H3653]] You will put [[H5414]] Pharaoh’s [[H6547]] cup [[H3563]] into his hand, [[H3027]] just as [[H4941]] you did [[H7223]] when [[H834]] you were [[H1961]] his cupbearer. [[H4945]]

###### 14
But [[H3588]] when [[H834]] it goes well [[H3190]] for you,  please [[H4994]] remember [[H2142]] me [[H854]] and show [[H6213]] me [[H5978]] kindness [[H2617]] by mentioning [[H2142]] me to [[H413]] Pharaoh, [[H6547]] that he might bring me out [[H3318]] of [[H4480]] this [[H2088]] prison. [[H1004]]

###### 15
For [[H3588]] I was kidnapped [[H1589]] from the land [[H776]] of the Hebrews, [[H5680]] and even [[H1571]] here [[H6311]] I have done [[H6213]] nothing [[H3808]] for which [[H3588]] they should have put [[H7760]] me [[H853]] in this dungeon.” [[H953]]

###### 16
When the chief [[H8269]] baker [[H644]] saw [[H7200]] that [[H3588]] the interpretation [[H6622]] was favorable, [[H2896]] he said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Joseph, [[H3130]] “I [[H589]] too [[H637]] had a dream: [[H2472]] There were [[H2009]] three [[H7969]] baskets [[H5536]] of white bread [[H2751]] on [[H5921]] my head. [[H7218]]

###### 17
In the top [[H5945]] basket [[H5536]] were all sorts of [[H3605]] baked [[H644]] goods [[H3978]] for Pharaoh, [[H6547]] but the birds [[H5775]] were eating [[H398]] them out of [[H4480]] the basket [[H5536]] on [[H5921]] my head.” [[H7218]]

###### 18
Joseph [[H3130]] replied, [[H6030]] “This [[H2088]] is the interpretation: [[H6623]] The three [[H7969]] baskets [[H5536]] are three [[H7969]] days. [[H3117]]

###### 19
Within [[H5750]] three [[H7969]] days [[H3117]] Pharaoh [[H6547]] will lift [[H5375]] your head [[H7218]] off of you [[H5921]] and hang [[H8518]] you [[H853]] on [[H5921]] a tree. [[H6086]] Then the birds [[H5775]] will eat [[H398]] the flesh [[H1320]] of your body.” [[H5921]]

###### 20
On the third [[H7992]] day, [[H3117]] which was Pharaoh’s [[H6547]] birthday, [[H3117]] he held [[H6213]] a feast [[H4960]] for all [[H3605]] his officials, [[H5650]] and in [[H8432]] [their presence] [[H5650]] he lifted up [[H5375]] the heads [[H7218]] of the chief [[H8269]] cupbearer [[H4945]] and the chief [[H8269]] baker. [[H644]]

###### 21
Pharaoh restored [[H7725]] the chief [[H8269]] cupbearer [[H4945]] to [[H5921]] his position, [[H4945]] so that he once again placed [[H5414]] the cup [[H3563]] in [[H5921]] Pharaoh’s [[H6547]] hand. [[H3709]]

###### 22
But [[H853]] Pharaoh hanged [[H8518]] the chief [[H8269]] baker, [[H644]] just as [[H834]] Joseph [[H3130]] had interpreted [the dream] [[H6622]] to them. 

###### 23
The chief [[H8269]] cupbearer, [[H4945]] however, did not [[H3808]] remember [[H2142]] Joseph; [[H3130]] he forgot all about him. [[H7911]]
