### 1
Now Jacob heard [[H8085]] that Laban’s [[H3837]] sons [[H1121]] were saying, [[H1697]] “Jacob [[H3290]] has taken away [[H3947]] all [[H3605]] that [belonged to] [[H834]] our father [[H1]] and built [[H6213]] all [[H3605]] this [[H2088]] wealth [[H3519]] at [[H834]] our father’s expense.” [[H1]]

### 2
And Jacob [[H3290]] saw [[H7200]] from the countenance [[H6440]] of Laban [[H3837]] that his attitude toward [[H5973]] him [[H8543]] had changed. [[H369]]

### 3
Then the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Jacob, [[H3290]] “Go back [[H7725]] to [[H413]] the land [[H776]] of your fathers [[H1]] and to your kindred, [[H4138]] and I will be [[H1961]] with you.” [[H5973]]

### 4
So Jacob [[H3290]] sent word [[H7971]] and called [[H7121]] Rachel [[H7354]] and Leah [[H3812]] to the field [[H7704]] where his flocks were, [[H6629]]

### 5
and he told [[H559]] them,  “I [[H595]] can see [[H7200]] from your father’s [[H1]] face [[H6440]] that [[H3588]] his attitude toward me [[H413]] has changed; [[H369]] but the God [[H430]] of my father [[H1]] has been [[H1961]] with me. [[H5978]]

### 6
You [[H859]] know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I have served [[H5647]] your father [[H1]] with all [[H3605]] my strength. [[H3581]]

### 7
And although he [[H1]] has cheated [[H2048]] me  and changed [[H2498]] my wages [[H4909]] ten [[H6235]] times, [[H4489]] God [[H430]] has not [[H3808]] allowed him [[H5414]] to harm me. [[H7489]]

### 8
If [[H518]] he said, [[H559]] ‘The speckled [[H5348]] will be [[H1961]] your wages,’ [[H7939]] then the whole [[H3605]] flock [[H6629]] bore [[H3205]] speckled offspring. [[H5348]] If [[H518]] he said, [[H559]] ‘The streaked [[H6124]] will be [[H1961]] your wages,’ [[H7939]] then the whole [[H3605]] flock [[H6629]] bore [[H3205]] streaked offspring. [[H6124]]

### 9
Thus God [[H430]] has taken away [[H5337]] your father’s [[H1]] livestock [[H4735]] and given [[H5414]] [them] to me. 

### 10
When [[H6256]] the flocks [[H6629]] were breeding, [[H3179]] I saw [[H5375]] in a dream [[H2472]] that the streaked, [[H6124]] spotted, [[H1261]] and speckled [[H5348]] males [[H6260]] were mating [[H5927]] with [[H5921]] the females. [[H6629]]

### 11
In that dream [[H2472]] the Angel [[H4397]] of God [[H430]] said [[H559]] to me, [[H413]] ‘Jacob!’ [[H3290]] And I replied, [[H559]] ‘Here I am.’ [[H2009]]

### 12
‘Look up,’ [[H5375]] He said, [[H559]] ‘and see [[H7200]] that all [[H3605]] the males [[H6260]] that are mating [[H5927]] with [[H5921]] the flock [[H6629]] are streaked, [[H6124]] spotted, [[H1261]] or speckled; [[H5348]] for [[H3588]] I have seen [[H7200]] all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] Laban [[H3837]] has done [[H6213]] to you. 

### 13
I [[H595]] am the God [[H410]] of Bethel, [[H1008]] where [[H834]] you anointed [[H4886]] the pillar [[H4676]] and made [[H5087]] a solemn vow to Me. [[H5088]] Now [[H6258]] get up [[H6965]] and leave [[H3318]] this [[H2063]] land {at once}, [[H776]] and return [[H7725]] to [[H413]] your native [[H4138]] land.’” [[H776]]

### 14
Then Rachel [[H7354]] and Leah [[H3812]] replied, [[H6030]] “Do we  have any portion [[H2506]] or inheritance [[H5159]] left [[H5750]] in our father’s [[H1]] house? [[H1004]]

### 15
Are we not [[H3808]] regarded [[H2803]] by him  as outsiders? [[H5237]] Not only [[H3588]] has he sold us, [[H4376]] but he has [[H1571]] certainly squandered [[H398]] the money paid for us. [[H3701]]

### 16
Surely [[H3588]] all [[H3605]] the wealth [[H6239]] that [[H834]] God [[H430]] has taken away [[H5337]] from our father [[H1]] belongs to us  and to our children. [[H1121]] So [[H6258]] do [[H6213]] whatever [[H3605]] God [[H430]] has told [[H559]] you.” [[H413]]

### 17
So Jacob [[H3290]] got up [[H6965]] and put [[H5375]] his children [[H1121]] and his wives [[H802]] on [[H5921]] camels, [[H1581]]

### 18
and he drove [[H5090]] all [[H3605]] his livestock {before him}, [[H4735]] along with all [[H3605]] the possessions [[H7399]] he had acquired [[H7408]] in Paddan-aram, [[H6307]] to go [[H935]] to [[H413]] his father [[H1]] Isaac [[H3327]] in the land [[H776]] in Canaan. [[H3667]]

### 19
Now while Laban [[H3837]] was out [[H1980]] shearing [[H1494]] his sheep, [[H6629]] Rachel [[H7354]] stole [[H1589]] her father’s [[H1]] household idols. [[H8655]]

### 20
Moreover, Jacob [[H3290]] deceived [[H1589]] Laban [[H3837]] the Aramean [[H761]] by not [[H1097]] telling [[H5046]] him  that [[H3588]] he [[H1931]] was running away. [[H1272]]

### 21
So he [[H1931]] fled [[H1272]] with all [[H3605]] his possessions, [[H834]] crossed [[H5674]] the Euphrates, [[H5104]] and headed for [[H7760]] the hill country [[H2022]] of Gilead. [[H1568]]

### 22
On the third [[H7992]] day [[H3117]] Laban [[H3837]] was informed [[H5046]] that [[H3588]] Jacob [[H3290]] had fled. [[H1272]]

### 23
So he took [[H3947]] his kinsmen [[H251]] with him, [[H5973]] pursued [[H7291]] Jacob [[H310]] for seven [[H7651]] days, [[H3117]] and overtook [[H1692]] him at Mount [[H2022]] Gilead. [[H1568]]

### 24
But that night [[H3915]] God [[H430]] came [[H935]] to [[H413]] Laban [[H3837]] the Aramean [[H761]] in a dream [[H2472]] and warned [[H559]] him,  “Be careful [[H8104]] not [[H6435]] to say [[H1696]] anything to [[H5973]] Jacob, [[H3290]] either good [[H2896]] or [[H5704]] bad.” [[H7451]]

### 25
Now Jacob [[H3290]] had pitched [[H8628]] his tent [[H168]] in the hill country [[H2022]] of Gilead, [[H1568]] and when Laban [[H3837]] overtook [[H5381]] [him], [[H3290]] he [[H3837]] and his brothers [[H251]] camped [[H8628]] [there as well]. [[H2022]]

### 26
Then Laban [[H3837]] said [[H559]] to Jacob, [[H3290]] “What [[H4100]] have you done? [[H6213]] You have deceived [[H1589]] me [[H853]] and carried off my daughters [[H1323]] like captives [[H7617]] of war! [[H2719]]

### 27
Why [[H4100]] did you run away [[H1272]] secretly [[H2244]] and deceive [[H1589]] me, [[H853]] without even [[H3808]] telling [[H5046]] me?  I would have sent you away [[H7971]] with joy [[H8057]] and singing, [[H7892]] with tambourines [[H8596]] and harps. [[H3658]]

### 28
But you did not [[H3808]] even let [[H5203]] me kiss [[H5401]] my grandchildren [[H1121]] and daughters { goodbye }. [[H1323]] Now [[H6258]] you have done [[H6213]] a foolish thing. [[H5528]]

### 29
I have power to do [[H6213]] you [[H5973]] great harm, [[H7451]] but last night [[H570]] the God [[H430]] of your father [[H1]] said [[H559]] to me, [[H413]] ‘Be careful [[H8104]] not to say [[H1696]] anything to [[H5973]] Jacob, [[H3290]] either good [[H2896]] or [[H5704]] bad.’ [[H7451]]

### 30
Now [[H6258]] you have gone off [[H1980]] because [[H3588]] you long [[H3700]] for your father’s [[H1]] house. [[H1004]] But why [[H4100]] have you stolen [[H1589]] my gods?” [[H430]]

### 31
“I was afraid,” [[H3372]] Jacob [[H3290]] answered, [[H6030]] “for [[H3588]] I thought [[H559]] [you] [[H3837]] would take your daughters [[H1323]] from me [[H5973]] by force. [[H1497]]

### 32
If you find [[H4672]] your gods [[H430]] with [[H5973]] anyone here, [[H834]] he shall not [[H3808]] live! [[H2421]] In the presence of [[H5048]] our relatives, [[H251]] see [[H5234]] for yourself  if anything [[H4100]] is yours, [[H5978]] and take [[H3947]] it back.”  For Jacob [[H3290]] did not [[H3808]] know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] Rachel [[H7354]] had stolen [the idols]. [[H1589]]

### 33
So Laban [[H3837]] went [[H935]] into Jacob’s [[H3290]] tent, [[H168]] then Leah’s [[H3812]] tent, [[H168]] and then the tents [[H168]] of the two [[H8147]] maidservants, [[H519]] but he found [[H4672]] nothing. [[H3808]] Then he left [[H3318]] Leah’s [[H3812]] tent [[H168]] and entered [[H935]] Rachel’s [[H7354]] tent. [[H168]]

### 34
Now Rachel [[H7354]] had taken [[H3947]] Laban’s household idols, [[H8655]] put [[H7760]] them in the saddlebag [[H3733]] of her camel, [[H1581]] and was sitting [[H3427]] on them. [[H5921]] And Laban [[H3837]] searched [[H4959]] everything [[H3605]] in the tent [[H168]] but found [[H4672]] nothing. [[H3808]]

### 35
[Rachel] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] her father, [[H1]] “Sir, [[H113]] do not [[H408]] be angry [[H2734]] that [[H3588]] I cannot [[H3808]] stand up [[H6965]] before you; [[H6440]] for [[H3588]] I am having my period.” [[H1870]] So Laban searched, [[H2664]] but could not [[H3808]] find [[H4672]] the household idols. [[H8655]]

### 36
Then Jacob [[H3290]] became incensed [[H2734]] and challenged [[H7378]] Laban. [[H3837]] “What [[H4100]] is my crime?” [[H6588]] he [[H3290]] said. [[H559]] “For what [[H4100]] sin of mine [[H2403]] have you so hotly pursued [[H1814]] me? [[H310]]

### 37
You have searched [[H4959]] all [[H3605]] my goods! [[H3627]] Have you found [[H4672]] anything [[H3605]] that belongs to you? [[H3627]] Put [[H7760]] it here [[H3541]] before [[H5048]] my brothers [[H251]] and yours, [[H251]] that they may judge [[H3198]] between [[H996]] the two of us. [[H8147]]

### 38
I have [[H595]] been with [[H5973]] you for [[H2088]] twenty [[H6242]] years now. [[H8141]] Your sheep [[H7353]] and goats [[H5795]] have not [[H3808]] miscarried, [[H7921]] nor have I [[H3808]] eaten [[H398]] the rams [[H352]] of your flock. [[H6629]]

### 39
I did not [[H3808]] bring [[H935]] you [[H413]] anything torn by wild beasts; [[H2966]] I [[H595]] bore the loss myself. [[H2398]] And you demanded [[H1245]] payment from me [[H3027]] for what was stolen [[H1589]] by day [[H3117]] or night. [[H3915]]

### 40
As it was, [[H1961]] the heat [[H2721]] consumed me [[H398]] by day [[H3117]] and the frost [[H7140]] by night, [[H3915]] and sleep [[H8142]] fled [[H5074]] from my eyes. [[H5869]]

### 41
Thus [[H2088]] for twenty [[H6242]] years [[H8141]] I have served [[H5647]] in your household— [[H1004]] fourteen [[H702]] years [[H8141]] for your two [[H8147]] daughters [[H1323]] and six [[H8337]] years [[H8141]] for your flocks— [[H6629]] and you have changed [[H2498]] my wages [[H4909]] ten [[H6235]] times! [[H4489]]

### 42
If the God [[H430]] of my father, [[H1]] the God [[H430]] of Abraham [[H85]] and the One Feared [[H6343]] by Isaac, [[H3327]] had not [[H3884]] been with me, [[H1961]] surely [[H3588]] by now [[H6258]] you would have sent me away [[H7971]] empty-handed. [[H7387]] But God [[H430]] has seen [[H7200]] my affliction [[H6040]] and the toil [[H3018]] of my hands, [[H3709]] and last night [[H570]] He rendered judgment.” [[H3198]]

### 43
But Laban [[H3837]] answered [[H6030]] Jacob, [[H3290]] “[These] daughters [[H1323]] are my daughters, [[H1323]] [these] sons [[H1121]] [are] my sons, [[H1121]] and [these] flocks [[H6629]] [are] my flocks! [[H6629]] Everything [[H3605]] you [[H859]] see is mine! [[H7200]] Yet what [[H4100]] can I do [[H6213]] today [[H3117]] about these [[H428]] daughters [[H1323]] of mine or [[H176]] the children [[H1121]] they have borne? [[H3205]]

### 44
Come [[H1980]] now, [[H6258]] let us make [[H3772]] a covenant, [[H1285]] you [[H859]] and I, [[H589]] and let it serve as [[H1961]] a witness [[H5707]] between [[H996]] you and me.” [[H996]]

### 45
So Jacob [[H3290]] picked out [[H3947]] a stone [[H68]] and set it up [[H7311]] as a pillar, [[H4676]]

### 46
and [he] [[H3290]] said [[H559]] to his relatives, [[H251]] “Gather [[H3950]] [some] stones.” [[H68]] So they took [[H3947]] stones [[H68]] and made [[H6213]] a mound, [[H1530]] and there [[H8033]] by [[H5921]] the mound [[H1530]] they ate. [[H398]]

### 47
Laban [[H3837]] named [[H7121]] it Jegar-sahadutha, [[H3026]] but Jacob [[H3290]] called it [[H7121]] Galeed. [[H1567]]

### 48
Then Laban [[H3837]] declared, [[H559]] “This [[H2088]] mound [[H1530]] is a witness [[H5707]] between you [[H996]] and me [[H996]] this day.” [[H3117]] Therefore [[H5921]] the place was called [[H7121]] Galeed, [[H1567]]

### 49
and also Mizpah, [[H4709]] because [[H834]] he said, [[H559]] “May the LORD [[H3068]] keep watch [[H6822]] between you [[H996]] and me [[H996]] when [[H3588]] we are absent [[H5641]] from one another. [[H7453]]

### 50
If [[H518]] you mistreat [[H6031]] my daughters [[H1323]] or [[H518]] take [[H3947]] other [[H5921]] wives, [[H802]] although no [[H369]] one [[H376]] is with us, [[H5973]] remember [[H7200]] that God [[H430]] [is] witness [[H5707]] between you and me.” [[H996]]

### 51
Laban [[H3837]] also said [[H559]] to Jacob, [[H3290]] “Here is [[H2009]] the [[H2088]] mound, [[H1530]] and here is the pillar [[H4676]] I have set up [[H3384]] between you and me. [[H996]]

### 52
This [[H2088]] mound [[H1530]] is a witness, [[H5707]] and this pillar [[H4676]] is a witness, [[H5713]] that [[H518]] I [[H589]] will not [[H3808]] go past [[H5674]] this [[H2088]] mound [[H1530]] to harm you, [[H413]] and you [[H859]] will not [[H3808]] go past [[H5674]] this [[H2088]] mound [[H1530]] and [[H2063]] pillar [[H4676]] to harm me. [[H7451]]

### 53
May the God [[H430]] of Abraham [[H85]] and the God [[H430]] of Nahor, [[H5152]] the God [[H430]] of their father, [[H1]] judge [[H8199]] between us.” [[H996]] So Jacob [[H3290]] swore [[H7650]] by the One feared [[H6343]] by his father [[H1]] Isaac. [[H3327]]

### 54
Then Jacob [[H3290]] offered [[H2076]] a sacrifice [[H2077]] on the mountain [[H2022]] and invited [[H7121]] his kinsmen [[H251]] to eat [[H398]] a meal. [[H3899]] And after they had eaten, [[H398]] they spent the night [[H3885]] on the mountain. [[H2022]]

### 55
Early the next morning, [[H1242]] Laban [[H3837]] got up [[H7925]] and kissed [[H5401]] his grandchildren [[H1121]] and daughters [[H1323]] and blessed them. [[H1288]] Then [he] [[H3837]] left [[H1980]] to return [[H7725]] home. [[H4725]]
