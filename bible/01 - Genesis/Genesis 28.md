###### 1
So Isaac [[H3327]] called for [[H7121]] Jacob [[H3290]] and blessed [[H1288]] him. [[H853]] “Do not [[H3808]] take [[H3947]] a wife [[H802]] from the Canaanite [[H3667]] women,” [[H1323]] he commanded. [[H6680]]

###### 2
“Go [[H1980]] at once [[H6965]] to Paddan-aram, [[H6307]] to the house [[H1004]] of your mother’s [[H517]] father [[H1]] Bethuel, [[H1328]] and take [[H3947]] a wife [[H802]] from among the daughters [[H1323]] of Laban, [[H3837]] your mother’s [[H517]] brother. [[H251]]

###### 3
May God [[H410]] Almighty [[H7706]] bless [[H1288]] you [[H853]] and make you fruitful [[H6509]] and multiply you, [[H7235]] so that you may become [[H1961]] a company [[H6951]] of peoples. [[H5971]]

###### 4
And may He give [[H5414]] the blessing [[H1293]] of Abraham [[H85]] to  you and your descendants, [[H2233]] so that you may possess [[H3423]] the land [[H776]] where you dwell as a foreigner, [[H4033]] the land [[H834]] God [[H430]] gave [[H5414]] to Abraham.” [[H85]]

###### 5
So Isaac [[H3327]] sent [[H7971]] Jacob [[H3290]] to Paddan-aram, [[H6307]] to [[H413]] Laban [[H3837]] son [[H1121]] of Bethuel [[H1328]] the Aramean, [[H761]] the brother [[H251]] of Rebekah, [[H7259]] the mother [[H517]] of Jacob [[H3290]] and Esau. [[H6215]]

###### 6
Now Esau [[H6215]] learned [[H7200]] that [[H3588]] Isaac [[H3327]] had blessed [[H1288]] Jacob [[H3290]] and sent [[H7971]] him to Paddan-aram [[H6307]] to take [[H3947]] a wife [[H802]] there, [[H8033]] commanding him, [[H6680]] “Do not [[H3808]] marry [[H3947]] a Canaanite [[H3667]] woman,” [[H1323]]

###### 7
and that Jacob [[H3290]] had obeyed [[H8085]] his father [[H1]] and mother [[H517]] and gone [[H1980]] to Paddan-aram. [[H6307]]

###### 8
And [[H6215]] seeing [[H7200]] that [[H3588]] his father [[H1]] Isaac [[H3327]] disapproved of [[H7451]] the Canaanite [[H3667]] women, [[H1323]]

###### 9
Esau [[H6215]] went [[H1980]] to [[H413]] Ishmael [[H3458]] and married [[H3947]] Mahalath, [[H4258]] the sister [[H269]] of Nebaioth [[H5032]] [and] daughter [[H1323]] of Abraham’s [[H85]] son [[H1121]] Ishmael, [[H3458]] in addition to [[H5921]] the wives [[H802]] he already had. 

###### 10
Meanwhile Jacob [[H3290]] left [[H3318]] Beersheba [[H884]] and set out for [[H1980]] Haran. [[H2771]]

###### 11
On reaching [[H6293]] a certain place, [[H4725]] he spent the night [[H3885]] there [[H8033]] because [[H3588]] the sun [[H8121]] had set. [[H935]] And taking [[H3947]] one of the stones [[H68]] from that place, [[H4725]] he put [[H7760]] it under his head [[H4763]] and lay down [[H7901]] to sleep. [[H4725]]

###### 12
And [Jacob] dreamed [[H2492]] about [[H2009]] a ladder [[H5551]] that rested [[H5324]] on the earth [[H776]] with its top [[H7218]] reaching [[H5060]] up to heaven, [[H8064]] and God’s [[H430]] angels [[H4397]] were going up [[H5927]] and down [the ladder]. [[H3381]]

###### 13
And there [[H2009]] at the top [[H5921]] the LORD [[H3068]] was standing [[H5324]] and saying, [[H559]] “I [[H589]] am the LORD, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of your father [[H1]] Abraham [[H85]] and the God [[H430]] of Isaac. [[H3327]] I will give [[H5414]] you and your descendants [[H2233]] the land [[H776]] on which [[H834]] you [[H859]] now lie. [[H7901]]

###### 14
Your descendants [[H2233]] will be [[H1961]] like the dust [[H6083]] of the earth, [[H776]] and you will spread out [[H6555]] to the west [[H3220]] and east [[H6924]] and north [[H6828]] and south. [[H5045]] All [[H3605]] the families [[H4940]] of the earth [[H127]] will be blessed [[H1288]] through you  and your offspring. [[H2233]]

###### 15
Look, [[H2009]] I [[H595]] am with you, [[H5973]] and I will watch over you [[H8104]] wherever [[H3605]] you go, [[H1980]] and I will bring you back [[H7725]] to [[H413]] this [[H2063]] land. [[H127]] For [[H3588]] I will not [[H3808]] leave [[H5800]] you until [[H5704]] I have done [[H6213]] what [[H834]] I have promised [[H1696]] you.” 

###### 16
When Jacob [[H3290]] woke up, [[H3364]] he thought, [[H559]] “Surely [[H403]] the LORD [[H3068]] is [[H3426]] in this [[H2088]] place, [[H4725]] and I [[H595]] was unaware of it.” [[H3045]]

###### 17
And he was afraid [[H3372]] and said, [[H559]] “How [[H4100]] awesome [[H3372]] [is] this [[H2088]] place! [[H4725]] This [[H2088]] is none [[H369]] other than [[H3588]] the house [[H1004]] of God; [[H430]] this [[H2088]] is the gate [[H8179]] of heaven!” [[H8064]]

###### 18
Early [[H7925]] the next morning, [[H1242]] Jacob [[H3290]] took [[H3947]] the stone [[H68]] that [[H834]] he had placed [[H7760]] under his head, [[H4763]] and he set it up [[H7760]] as a pillar. [[H4676]] He poured [[H3332]] oil [[H8081]] on [[H5921]] top of it, [[H7218]]

###### 19
and he called [[H7121]] that [[H1931]] place [[H4725]] Bethel, [[H1008]] though [[H199]] previously [[H7223]] the city [[H5892]] had been named [[H8034]] Luz. [[H3870]]

###### 20
Then Jacob [[H3290]] made [[H5087]] a vow, [[H5088]] saying, [[H559]] “If [[H518]] God [[H430]] will be [[H1961]] with [[H5978]] me and watch over [[H8104]] me on this [[H2088]] journey, [[H1870]] and if He will provide [[H5414]] me  with food [[H3899]] to eat [[H398]] and clothes [[H899]] to wear, [[H3847]]

###### 21
so that I may return [[H7725]] safely [[H7965]] to [[H413]] my father’s [[H1]] house, [[H1004]] then the LORD [[H3068]] will be [[H1961]] my  God. [[H430]]

###### 22
And this [[H2063]] stone [[H68]] I have set up [[H7760]] as a pillar [[H4676]] will be [[H1961]] God’s [[H430]] house, [[H1004]] and of all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] You give [[H5414]] me,  I will surely [[H6237]] give You a tenth.” [[H6237]]
