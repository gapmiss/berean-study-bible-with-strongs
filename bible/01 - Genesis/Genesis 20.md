###### 1
Now Abraham [[H85]] journeyed [[H5265]] from there [[H8033]] to the region [[H776]] of the Negev [[H5045]] and settled [[H3427]] between [[H996]] Kadesh [[H6946]] and Shur. [[H7793]] While he was staying [[H1481]] in Gerar, [[H1642]]

###### 2
Abraham [[H85]] said [[H559]] of [[H413]] his wife [[H802]] Sarah, [[H8283]] “She [[H1931]] is my sister.” [[H269]] So Abimelech [[H40]] king [[H4428]] of Gerar [[H1642]] had Sarah [[H8283]] brought [[H7971]] to him. [[H3947]]

###### 3
One night, however, [[H3915]] God [[H430]] came [[H935]] to [[H413]] Abimelech [[H40]] in a dream [[H2472]] and told him, [[H559]] “You are as good as dead [[H4191]] because of [[H5921]] the woman [[H802]] you have taken, [[H3947]] for she [[H1931]] is a married [[H1166]] woman.” [[H1167]]

###### 4
Now Abimelech [[H40]] had not [[H3808]] gone near her, [[H7126]] so he replied, [[H559]] “Lord, [[H136]] would You destroy [[H2026]] a nation [[H1471]] even though [[H1571]] it is innocent? [[H6662]]

###### 5
Didn’t [[H3808]] [Abraham] [[H1931]] tell me, [[H559]] ‘She [[H1931]] is my sister’? [[H269]] And she [[H1931]] herself [[H1931]] said, [[H559]] ‘He [[H1931]] is my brother.’ [[H251]] I have done [[H6213]] this [[H2063]] with a clear [[H8537]] conscience [[H3824]] and clean [[H5356]] hands.” [[H3709]]

###### 6
Then God [[H430]] said [[H559]] to [Abimelech] [[H413]] in the dream, [[H2472]] “Yes, [[H1571]] I [[H595]] know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] you did [[H6213]] this [[H2063]] with a clear [[H8537]] conscience, [[H3824]] and so I [[H595]] have also [[H1571]] kept [[H2820]] you [[H853]] from sinning against Me. [[H2398]] That is why [[H5921]] I did not [[H3808]] let [[H5414]] you touch [[H5060]] her. [[H413]]

###### 7
Now [[H6258]] return [[H7725]] the man’s [[H376]] wife, [[H802]] for [[H3588]] he [[H1931]] is a prophet; [[H5030]] he will pray [[H6419]] for you [[H1157]] and you will live. [[H2421]] But if [[H518]] you do not [[H369]] restore her, [[H7725]] be aware [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] you will surely [[H4191]] die— [[H4191]] you [[H859]] and all [[H3605]] who belong [[H834]] to you. 

###### 8
Early the next morning [[H1242]] Abimelech [[H40]] got up [[H7925]] and summoned [[H7121]] all [[H3605]] his servants; [[H5650]] and when he described to them [[H1696]] all [[H3605]] that [[H428]] had happened, [[H1697]] the men [[H376]] were terrified. [[H3372]]

###### 9
Then Abimelech [[H40]] called [[H7121]] Abraham [[H85]] and asked, [[H559]] “What [[H4100]] have you done to us? [[H6213]] How [[H4100]] have I sinned [[H2398]] against you,  that [[H3588]] you have brought [[H935]] such tremendous [[H1419]] guilt [[H2401]] upon me [[H5921]] and [[H5921]] my kingdom? [[H4467]] You have done [[H6213]] things [[H4639]] to me [[H5978]] that [[H834]] should not [[H3808]] be done. [[H6213]]

###### 10
Abimelech [[H40]] also asked [[H559]] Abraham, [[H85]] “What [[H4100]] prompted [[H7200]] you to do [[H6213]] such [[H2088]] a thing?” [[H1697]]

###### 11
Abraham [[H85]] replied, [[H559]] “I thought to myself, [[H559]] ‘Surely [[H7535]] there is no [[H369]] fear [[H3374]] of God [[H430]] in this [[H2088]] place. [[H4725]] They will kill me [[H2026]] on account of [[H5921]] my wife.’ [[H802]]

###### 12
Besides, [[H1571]] she [[H1931]] really [[H546]] is my sister, [[H269]] the daughter [[H1323]] of my father— [[H1]] though [[H389]] not [[H3808]] the daughter [[H1323]] of my mother— [[H517]] and she became [[H1961]] my wife. [[H802]]

###### 13
So when [[H834]] God [[H430]] had me journey [[H8582]] from my father’s [[H1]] house, [[H1004]] I said [[H559]] to [Sarah],  ‘This is how [[H2088]] you can show [[H6213]] your loyalty [[H2617]] to me: [[H5978]] Wherever [[H3605]] we go, [[H935]] say of me, [[H559]] “He is [[H1931]] my brother.”’” [[H251]]

###### 14
So Abimelech [[H40]] brought [[H3947]] sheep [[H6629]] and cattle, [[H1241]] menservants [[H5650]] and maidservants, [[H8198]] and he gave [[H5414]] them to Abraham [[H85]] and restored [[H7725]] his wife [[H802]] Sarah to him. [[H8283]]

###### 15
And Abimelech [[H40]] said, [[H559]] “Look, [[H2009]] my land [[H776]] is before you. [[H6440]] Settle wherever you please.” [[H3427]]

###### 16
And he said [[H559]] to Sarah, [[H8283]] “See, [[H2009]] I am giving [[H5414]] your brother [[H251]] a thousand [pieces] [[H505]] of silver. [[H3701]] It [is] [[H1931]] your  vindication [[H3682]] before all [[H3605]] who [[H834]] are with you; [[H854]] you are completely [[H3605]] cleared.” [[H3198]]

###### 17
Then Abraham [[H85]] prayed [[H6419]] to [[H413]] God, [[H430]] and God [[H430]] healed [[H7495]] Abimelech [[H40]] and his wife [[H802]] and his maidservants, [[H519]] so that they could again bear children— [[H3205]]

###### 18
for [[H3588]] on [[H5921]] account [[H1697]] of Abraham’s [[H85]] wife [[H802]] Sarah, [[H8283]] the LORD [[H3068]] had completely closed [[H6113]] all [[H3605]] the wombs [[H7358]] in Abimelech’s [[H40]] household. [[H1004]]
