### 1
So Abram [[H87]] went up [[H5927]] out of Egypt [[H4714]] into the Negev— [[H5045]] he [[H1931]] and his wife [[H802]] and all his possessions— [[H3605]] and Lot [was] [[H3876]] with him. [[H5973]]

### 2
And Abram [[H87]] had become extremely [[H3966]] wealthy [[H3513]] in livestock [[H4735]] and silver [[H3701]] and gold. [[H2091]]

### 3
From the Negev [[H5045]] he journeyed [[H1980]] from place to place [[H4550]] toward  Bethel, [[H1008]] until he came [[H5704]] to [[H5704]] the place [[H4725]] between [[H996]] Bethel [[H1008]] and Ai [[H5857]] where [[H834]] his tent [[H168]] had formerly [[H8462]] been pitched, [[H1961]]

### 4
to [[H413]] the site [[H4725]] where [[H834]] he had built [[H6213]] the altar. [[H4196]] And there [[H8033]] Abram [[H87]] called [[H7121]] on the name [[H8034]] of the LORD. [[H3068]]

### 5
Now Lot, [[H3876]] who was traveling [[H1980]] with [[H854]] Abram, [[H87]] also [[H1571]] had [[H1961]] flocks [[H6629]] and herds [[H1241]] and tents. [[H168]]

### 6
But the land [[H776]] was unable [[H3808]] to support [[H5375]] [both of] them [[H853]] while they stayed [[H3427]] together, [[H3162]] for [[H3588]] they had [[H1961]] so many [[H7227]] possessions [[H7399]] that they were unable [[H3201]] to coexist. [[H3427]]

### 7
And there was [[H1961]] discord [[H7379]] between [[H996]] the herdsmen [[H7473]] of Abram [[H87]] and the herdsmen [[H7473]] of Lot. [[H3876]] At that time [[H227]] the Canaanites [[H3669]] and the Perizzites [[H6522]] were also living [[H3427]] in the land. [[H776]]

### 8
So Abram [[H87]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Lot, [[H3876]] “Please [[H4994]] let there be [[H1961]] no [[H408]] contention [[H4808]] between you and me, [[H996]] or between [[H996]] your herdsmen [[H7473]] and my herdsmen. [[H7473]] After all, [[H3588]] we [[H587]] are brothers. [[H251]]

### 9
Is not [[H3808]] the whole [[H3605]] land [[H776]] before you? [[H6440]] Now [[H4994]] separate yourself [[H6504]] from me. [[H5921]] If [[H518]] you go to the left, [[H8040]] I will go to the right; [[H3231]] if [[H518]] you go to the right, [[H3225]] I will go to the left.” [[H8041]]

### 10
Lot [[H3876]] looked out [[H5375]] and saw [[H7200]] that the whole [[H3605]] plain [[H3603]] of the Jordan, [[H3383]] all the way [[H935]] to Zoar, [[H6820]] was well watered [[H4945]] like the garden [[H1588]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] like the land [[H776]] of Egypt. [[H4714]] (This was before [[H6440]] the LORD [[H3068]] destroyed [[H7843]] Sodom [[H5467]] and Gomorrah.) [[H6017]]

### 11
So Lot [[H3876]] chose [[H977]] the whole [[H3605]] plain [[H3603]] of the Jordan [[H3383]] for himself  [and] [[H3876]] set out [[H5265]] toward the east. [[H6924]] And [Abram and Lot] parted [[H6504]] company. [[H5921]]

### 12
Abram [[H87]] lived [[H3427]] in the land [[H776]] of Canaan, [[H3667]] but Lot [[H3876]] settled [[H3427]] in the cities [[H5892]] of the plain [[H3603]] and pitched [his] tent [[H167]] toward [[H5704]] Sodom. [[H5467]]

### 13
But the men [[H376]] of Sodom [[H5467]] were wicked, [[H7451]] sinning [[H2400]] greatly [[H3966]] against the LORD. [[H3068]]

### 14
After [[H310]] Lot [[H3876]] had departed, [[H6504]] the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Abram, [[H87]] “Now [[H4994]] lift up [[H5375]] your eyes [[H5869]] from [[H4480]] the place [[H4725]] where [[H834]] you [[H859]] are, [[H8033]] and look [[H7200]] to the north [[H6828]] and south [[H5045]] and east [[H6924]] and west. [[H3220]]

### 15
For [[H3588]] all [[H3605]] the land [[H776]] that [[H834]] you [[H859]] see, [[H7200]] I will give [[H5414]] to you  and your offspring [[H2233]] forever. [[H5704]]

### 16
I will make [[H7760]] your offspring [[H2233]] like the dust [[H6083]] of the earth, [[H776]] so that [[H834]] if [[H518]] one [[H582]] could [[H3201]] count [[H4487]] the dust [[H6083]] of the earth, [[H776]] then [[H1571]] your offspring [[H2233]] could be counted. [[H4487]]

### 17
Get up [[H6965]] and walk [[H1980]] around the land, [[H776]] through its length [[H753]] and width— [[H7341]] for [[H3588]] I will give it [[H5414]] to you.” 

### 18
So Abram [[H87]] moved his tent [[H167]] and went [[H935]] to live [[H3427]] near the oaks [[H436]] of Mamre [[H4471]] in Hebron, [[H2275]] where [[H8033]] he built [[H1129]] an altar [[H4196]] to the LORD. [[H3068]]
