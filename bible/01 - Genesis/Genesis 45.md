### 1
Joseph [[H3130]] could [[H3201]] no longer [[H3808]] control himself [[H662]] before all [[H3605]] his attendants, [[H5324]] and he cried out, [[H7121]] “Send everyone [[H3605]] away [[H3318]] from me!” [[H5921]] So none [[H3808]] [of them] were with [[H5975]] [Joseph] [[H854]] when he [[H3130]] made himself known [[H3045]] to [[H413]] his brothers. [[H251]]

### 2
But he wept [[H1065]] so loudly [[H5414]] that the Egyptians [[H4713]] and Pharaoh’s [[H6547]] household [[H1004]] heard him. [[H8085]]

### 3
Joseph [[H3130]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] his brothers, [[H251]] “I [[H589]] am Joseph! [[H3130]] Is my father [[H1]] still [[H5750]] alive?” [[H2416]] But they [[H251]] were unable [[H3808]] to answer [[H6030]] him, [[H853]] because [[H3588]] they were terrified [[H926]] in his presence. [[H6440]]

### 4
Then Joseph [[H3130]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] his brothers, [[H251]] “Please [[H4994]] come near me.” [[H5066]] And they [did so]. [[H5066]] “I [[H589]] am Joseph, [[H3130]] your brother,” [[H251]] he said, [[H559]] “the one [[H834]] you sold [[H4376]] into Egypt! [[H4714]]

### 5
And now, [[H6258]] do not [[H408]] be distressed [[H6087]] or angry [[H2734]] with yourselves [[H5869]] that [[H3588]] you sold [[H4376]] me [[H853]] into this place, [[H2008]] because [[H3588]] it was to save lives [[H4241]] that God [[H430]] sent me [[H7971]] before you. [[H6440]]

### 6
For [[H3588]] the famine [[H7458]] has covered [[H7130]] the land [[H776]] these [[H2088]] two years, [[H8141]] and there will be five [[H2568]] more [[H5750]] years [[H8141]] without [[H369]] plowing [[H2758]] or harvesting. [[H7105]]

### 7
God [[H430]] sent [[H7971]] me before you [[H6440]] to preserve [[H7760]] you  as a remnant [[H7611]] on the earth [[H776]] and to save your lives [[H2421]] by a great [[H1419]] deliverance. [[H6413]]

### 8
Therefore [[H6258]] it was not [[H3808]] you [[H859]] who sent [[H7971]] me here, [[H2008]] but [[H3588]] God, [[H430]] who has made me [[H7760]] Pharaoh's [[H6547]] adviser— [[H1]] lord [[H113]] of all [[H3605]] his household [[H1004]] and ruler [[H4910]] over all [[H3605]] the land [[H776]] of Egypt. [[H4714]]

### 9
Now return [[H5927]] quickly [[H4116]] to [[H413]] my father [[H1]] and tell [[H559]] him, [[H413]] ‘This is what [[H3541]] your son [[H1121]] Joseph [[H3130]] says: [[H559]] God [[H430]] has made [[H7760]] me lord [[H113]] of all [[H3605]] Egypt. [[H4714]] Come down [[H3381]] to [[H413]] me without [[H408]] delay. [[H5975]]

### 10
You shall settle [[H3427]] in the land [[H776]] of Goshen [[H1657]] and be [[H1961]] near me— [[H7138]] you [[H859]] and your children [[H1121]] and grandchildren, [[H1121]] your flocks [[H6629]] and herds, [[H1241]] and everything you own. [[H3605]]

### 11
And there [[H8033]] I will provide [[H3557]] for you, [[H853]] because [[H3588]] there will be five [[H2568]] more [[H5750]] years [[H8141]] of famine. [[H7458]] Otherwise, [[H6435]] you [[H859]] and your household [[H1004]] and everything [[H3605]] you own  will come to destitution.’ [[H3423]]

### 12
Behold! [[H2009]] You [[H5869]] and my brother [[H251]] Benjamin [[H1144]] can see [[H7200]] that [[H3588]] [it is] I, [Joseph], [[H6310]] who am speaking [[H1696]] with you. [[H413]]

### 13
Tell [[H5046]] my father [[H1]] about all [[H3605]] my splendor [[H3519]] in Egypt [[H4714]] and everything [[H3605]] you have seen. [[H7200]] And bring [[H3381]] my father [[H1]] down here [[H2008]] quickly.” [[H4116]]

### 14
Then Joseph threw his arms around [[H5307]] his brother [[H251]] Benjamin [[H1144]] and wept, [[H1058]] and Benjamin [[H1144]] wept [[H1058]] as [[H5921]] they embraced. [[H6677]]

### 15
Joseph kissed [[H5401]] each [[H3605]] of his brothers [[H251]] as he wept [[H1058]] over them. [[H5921]] And afterward [[H310]] his brothers [[H251]] talked [[H1696]] with him. [[H854]]

### 16
When the news [[H6963]] reached [[H8085]] Pharaoh’s [[H6547]] house [[H1004]] that Joseph’s [[H3130]] brothers [[H251]] had come, [[H935]] Pharaoh [[H6547]] and his servants [[H5650]] were pleased. [[H3190]]

### 17
Pharaoh [[H6547]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Joseph, [[H3130]] “Tell [[H559]] your brothers, [[H251]] ‘Do [[H6213]] as follows: [[H2063]] Load [[H2943]] your animals [[H1165]] and return [[H1980]] to the land [[H776]] of Canaan. [[H3667]]

### 18
Then bring [[H3947]] your father [[H1]] and your families [[H1004]] and return [[H935]] to me. [[H413]] I will give [[H5414]] you [[H853]] the best [[H2898]] of the land [[H776]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] and you shall eat [[H398]] from the fat [[H2459]] of the land.’ [[H776]]

### 19
You [[H859]] are also directed to tell them: [[H6680]] ‘Take [[H3947]] wagons [[H5699]] from the land [[H776]] of Egypt [[H4714]] for your young children [[H2945]] and your wives, [[H802]] and bring [[H5375]] your father [[H1]] and come back. [[H935]]

### 20
But pay no regard [[H5869]] to [[H5921]] your belongings, [[H3627]] for [[H3588]] the best [[H2898]] of all [[H3605]] the land [[H776]] of Egypt [[H4714]] [will be]  yours.’” [[H1931]]

### 21
So the sons [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] did [[H6213]] [as they were told]. [[H3651]] Joseph [[H3130]] gave [[H5414]] them wagons [[H5699]] as [[H5921]] Pharaoh [[H6547]] had instructed, [[H6310]] and he also gave [[H5414]] them  provisions [[H6720]] for their journey. [[H1870]]

### 22
He gave [[H5414]] new [[H2487]] garments [[H8071]] to each of them, [[H582]] but to Benjamin [[H1144]] he gave [[H5414]] three [[H7969]] hundred [shekels] [[H3967]] of silver [[H3701]] and five [[H2568]] sets [[H2487]] of clothes. [[H8071]]

### 23
And he sent [[H7971]] to his father [[H1]] the following: [[H2063]] ten [[H6235]] donkeys [[H2543]] loaded [[H5375]] with the best [[H2898]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] and ten [[H6235]] female donkeys [[H860]] loaded [[H5375]] with grain [[H1250]] and bread [[H3899]] and provisions [[H4202]] for his father’s [[H1]] journey. [[H1870]]

### 24
Then Joseph sent his brothers [[H251]] on their way, [[H7971]] and as they were leaving, [[H1980]] he said [[H559]] to them, [[H413]] “Do not [[H408]] quarrel [[H7264]] on the way!” [[H1870]]

### 25
So [the brothers] went up [[H5927]] out of Egypt [[H4714]] and came [[H935]] to [[H413]] their father [[H1]] Jacob [[H3290]] in the land [[H776]] of Canaan. [[H3667]]

### 26
“Joseph [[H3130]] is still [[H5750]] alive,” [[H2416]] they said, [[H5046]] “and [[H3588]] he [[H1931]] is ruler [[H4910]] over all [[H3605]] the land [[H776]] of Egypt!” [[H4714]] But Jacob was stunned, [[H6313]] for [[H3588]] he did not [[H3808]] believe them. [[H539]]

### 27
However, when they relayed [[H1696]] all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] Joseph [[H3130]] had told [[H1696]] them, [[H413]] and when he saw [[H7200]] the wagons [[H5699]] that [[H834]] Joseph [[H3130]] had sent [[H7971]] to carry [[H5375]] him back, [[H853]] the spirit [[H7307]] of their father [[H1]] Jacob [[H3290]] was revived. [[H2421]]

### 28
Then Israel [[H3478]] declared, [[H559]] “I am convinced! [[H7227]] My son [[H1121]] Joseph [[H3130]] is still [[H5750]] alive! [[H2416]] I will go [[H1980]] to see [[H7200]] him before [[H2962]] I die.” [[H4191]]
