### 1
Now the LORD [[H3068]] attended [[H6485]] to Sarah [[H8283]] as [[H834]] He had said, [[H559]] and the LORD [[H3068]] did [[H6213]] for Sarah [[H8283]] what [[H834]] He had promised. [[H1696]]

### 2
So Sarah [[H8283]] conceived [[H2029]] and bore [[H3205]] a son [[H1121]] to Abraham [[H85]] in his old age, [[H2208]] at the very time [[H4150]] God [[H430]] had promised him. [[H1696]]

### 3
And Abraham [[H85]] gave [[H7121]] the name [[H8034]] Isaac [[H3327]] to the son [[H1121]] Sarah [[H8283]] bore [[H3205]] to him. 

### 4
When his son [[H1121]] Isaac [[H3327]] was eight [[H8083]] days old, [[H3117]] Abraham [[H85]] circumcised him, [[H4135]] as [[H834]] God [[H430]] had commanded him. [[H6680]]

### 5
Abraham [[H85]] was a hundred [[H3967]] years old [[H1121]] when his son [[H1121]] Isaac [[H3327]] was born [[H3205]] to him. 

### 6
Then Sarah [[H8283]] said, [[H559]] “God [[H430]] has made [[H6213]] me  laugh, [[H6712]] and everyone [[H3605]] who hears of this [[H8085]] will laugh with me.” [[H6711]]

### 7
She added, [[H559]] “Who [[H4310]] would have told [[H4448]] Abraham [[H85]] that Sarah [[H8283]] would nurse [[H3243]] children? [[H1121]] Yet [[H3588]] I have borne him [[H3205]] a son [[H1121]] in his old age.” [[H2208]]

### 8
So the child [[H3206]] grew [[H1431]] and was weaned, [[H1580]] and Abraham [[H85]] held [[H6213]] a great [[H1419]] feast [[H4960]] on the day [[H3117]] Isaac [[H3327]] was weaned. [[H1580]]

### 9
But Sarah [[H8283]] saw that [[H7200]] the son [[H1121]] whom [[H834]] Hagar [[H1904]] the Egyptian [[H4713]] had borne [[H3205]] to Abraham [[H85]] was mocking [her son], [[H6711]]

### 10
and she said [[H559]] to Abraham, [[H85]] “Expel [[H1644]] the [[H2063]] slave woman [[H519]] and her son, [[H1121]] for [[H3588]] the slave woman’s [[H519]] son [[H1121]] will never [[H3808]] share in the inheritance [[H3423]] with [[H5973]] my son [[H1121]] Isaac!” [[H3327]]

### 11
Now this matter [[H1697]] distressed [[H7489]] Abraham [[H85]] greatly [[H3966]] because it concerned [[H182]] his son [Ishmael]. [[H1121]]

### 12
But God [[H430]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Abraham, [[H85]] “Do not [[H408]] be distressed [[H7489]] about [[H5921]] the boy [[H5288]] and your maidservant. [[H519]] Listen to [[H8085]] everything [[H3605]] that [[H834]] Sarah [[H8283]] tells [[H559]] you, [[H413]] for [[H3588]] through Isaac [[H3327]] your offspring [[H2233]] will be reckoned. [[H7121]]

### 13
But I will also [[H1571]] make [[H7760]] a nation [[H1471]] of the slave woman’s [[H519]] son, [[H1121]] because [[H3588]] he [[H1931]] is your offspring.” [[H2233]]

### 14
Early in the morning, [[H1242]] Abraham [[H85]] got up, [[H7925]] took [[H3947]] bread [[H3899]] and a skin of water, [[H2573]] put [[H7760]] them on [[H5921]] Hagar’s [[H1904]] shoulders, [[H7926]] and sent her away with the boy. [[H3206]] She left [[H1980]] and wandered [[H8582]] in the wilderness [[H4057]] of  Beersheba. [[H884]]

### 15
When the water [[H4325]] in [[H4480]] the skin [[H2573]] was gone, [[H3615]] she left [[H7993]] the boy [[H3206]] under [[H8478]] one [[H259]] of the bushes. [[H7880]]

### 16
Then she went off [[H1980]] and sat down [[H3427]] nearby, [[H5048]] about a bowshot [[H2909]] away, [[H7368]] for [[H3588]] she said, [[H559]] “I cannot [[H408]] bear to watch [[H7200]] the boy [[H3206]] die!” [[H4194]] And as she sat [[H3427]] nearby, [[H5048]] she lifted up [[H5375]] her voice [[H6963]] and wept. [[H1058]]

### 17
Then God [[H430]] heard [[H8085]] the voice [[H6963]] of the boy, [[H5288]] and the angel [[H4397]] of God [[H430]] called [[H7121]] to [[H413]] Hagar [[H1904]] from [[H4480]] heaven, [[H8064]] “What is wrong, [[H4100]] Hagar? [[H1904]] Do not [[H408]] be afraid, [[H3372]] for [[H3588]] God [[H430]] has heard [[H8085]] the voice [[H6963]] of the boy [[H5288]] where [[H834]] he [[H1931]] lies. [[H8033]]

### 18
Arise, [[H6965]] lift up [[H5375]] the boy [[H5288]] and take him [[H2388]] by the hand, [[H3027]] for [[H3588]] I will make him [[H7760]] into a great [[H1419]] nation.” [[H1471]]

### 19
Then God [[H430]] opened [[H6491]] her eyes, [[H5869]] and she saw [[H7200]] a well [[H875]] of water. [[H4325]] So she went [[H1980]] and filled [[H4390]] the skin with water [[H2573]] and gave the boy [[H5288]] a drink. [[H8248]]

### 20
And God [[H430]] was [[H1961]] with [[H854]] the boy, [[H5288]] and he grew up [[H1431]] and settled [[H3427]] in the wilderness [[H4057]] and became [[H1961]] a great [[H7235]] archer. [[H7199]]

### 21
And while he was dwelling [[H3427]] in the wilderness [[H4057]] of Paran, [[H6290]] his mother [[H517]] got [[H3947]] a wife [[H802]] for him  from the land [[H776]] of Egypt. [[H4714]]

### 22
At that [[H1931]] time [[H6256]] Abimelech [[H40]] and Phicol [[H6369]] the commander [[H8269]] of his army [[H6635]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Abraham, [[H85]] “God [[H430]] is with you [[H5973]] in all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] you [[H859]] do. [[H6213]]

### 23
Now, therefore, [[H6258]] swear [[H7650]] to me  here [[H2008]] before God [[H430]] that you will not [[H518]] deal falsely [[H8266]] with me  or my children [[H5209]] or descendants. [[H5220]] Show [[H6213]] to me [[H5978]] and [[H5973]] to the country [[H776]] in which [[H834]] you reside [[H1481]] the same kindness [[H2617]] that [[H834]] I have shown [[H6213]] to you.” [[H5973]]

### 24
And Abraham [[H85]] replied, [[H559]] “I [[H595]] swear it.” [[H7650]]

### 25
But when Abraham [[H85]] complained [[H3198]] to Abimelech [[H40]] about [[H5921]] a well [[H875]] that [[H834]] Abimelech’s [[H40]] servants [[H5650]] had seized, [[H1497]]

### 26
Abimelech [[H40]] replied, [[H559]] “I do not [[H3808]] know [[H3045]] who [[H4310]] has done [[H6213]] this. [[H2088]] You [[H859]] did not [[H3808]] tell [[H5046]] me,  so I [[H595]] have not [[H3808]] heard [[H8085]] about it until today.” [[H1115]]

### 27
So Abraham [[H85]] brought [[H3947]] sheep [[H6629]] and cattle [[H1241]] and gave [[H5414]] them to Abimelech, [[H40]] and the two men [[H8147]] made [[H3772]] a covenant. [[H1285]]

### 28
Abraham [[H85]] separated [[H5324]] seven [[H7651]] ewe lambs [[H3535]] from the flock, [[H6629]]

### 29
and Abimelech [[H40]] asked [[H559]] [him], [[H85]] “Why [[H4100]] have you set apart [[H5324]] these [[H428]] seven [[H7651]] ewe lambs?” [[H3535]]

### 30
He replied, [[H559]] “You are to accept [[H3947]] the seven [[H7651]] ewe lambs [[H3535]] from my hand [[H3027]] as my witness [[H5713]] that [[H3588]] I dug [[H2658]] this [[H2063]] well.” [[H875]]

### 31
So [[H5921]] that [[H1931]] place [[H4725]] was called [[H7121]] Beersheba, [[H884]] because [[H3588]] it was there [[H8033]] that the two [[H8147]] of them swore an oath. [[H7650]]

### 32
After they had made [[H3772]] the covenant [[H1285]] at Beersheba, [[H884]] Abimelech [[H40]] and Phicol [[H6369]] the commander [[H8269]] of his army [[H6635]] got up [[H6965]] and returned [[H7725]] to [[H413]] the land [[H776]] of the Philistines. [[H6430]]

### 33
And [Abraham] planted [[H5193]] a tamarisk tree [[H815]] in Beersheba, [[H884]] and there [[H8033]] he called [[H7121]] upon the name [[H8034]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] the Eternal [[H5769]] God. [[H410]]

### 34
And Abraham [[H85]] resided [[H1481]] in the land [[H776]] of the Philistines [[H6430]] for a long [[H7227]] time. [[H3117]]
