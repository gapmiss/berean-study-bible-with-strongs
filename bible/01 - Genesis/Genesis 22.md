### 1
Some time later [[H310]] God [[H430]] tested [[H5254]] Abraham [[H85]] and said [[H559]] to him, [[H413]] “Abraham!” [[H85]] “Here I am,” [[H2009]] he answered. [[H559]]

### 2
“Take [[H3947]] your son,” [[H1121]] [God] said, [[H559]] “your only [[H3173]] son Isaac, [[H3327]] whom [[H834]] you love, [[H157]] and go [[H1980]] to [[H413]] the land [[H776]] of Moriah. [[H4179]] Offer him [[H5927]] there [[H8033]] as a burnt offering [[H5930]] on [[H5921]] one [[H259]] of the mountains [[H2022]] I will show [[H559]] you.” [[H413]]

### 3
So Abraham [[H85]] got up early [[H7925]] the next morning, [[H1242]] saddled [[H2280]] his donkey, [[H2543]] and took [[H3947]] along [[H854]] two [[H8147]] of his servants [[H5288]] and his son [[H1121]] Isaac. [[H3327]] He split [[H1234]] wood [[H6086]] for a burnt offering [[H5930]] and set out for [[H6965]] the place [[H4725]] God [[H430]] had designated. [[H559]]

### 4
On the third [[H7992]] day [[H3117]] Abraham [[H85]] looked up [[H5375]] and saw [[H7200]] the place [[H4725]] in the distance. [[H7350]]

### 5
“Stay [[H3427]] here [[H6311]] with [[H5973]] the donkey,” [[H2543]] Abraham [[H85]] told [[H559]] his servants. [[H5288]] “The boy [[H5288]] and I [[H589]] will go [[H1980]] over [[H5704]] there [[H3541]] to worship, [[H7812]] and then we will return [[H7725]] to you.” [[H413]]

### 6
Abraham [[H85]] took [[H3947]] the wood [[H6086]] for the burnt offering [[H5930]] and placed [[H7760]] it on [[H5921]] his son [[H1121]] Isaac. [[H3327]] He himself carried [[H3947]] the fire [[H784]] and the sacrificial knife, [[H3979]] and the two [[H8147]] of them walked on [[H1980]] together. [[H3162]]

### 7
Then Isaac [[H3327]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] his father [[H1]] Abraham, [[H85]] “My father!” [[H1]] “Here I am, [[H2009]] my son,” [[H1121]] he replied. [[H559]] “The fire [[H784]] and the wood [[H6086]] are here,” [[H2009]] said Isaac, [[H559]] “but where [[H346]] is the lamb [[H7716]] for the burnt offering?” [[H5930]]

### 8
Abraham [[H85]] answered, [[H559]] “God [[H430]] Himself  will provide [[H7200]] the lamb [[H7716]] for the burnt offering, [[H5930]] my son.” [[H1121]] And the two [[H8147]] walked on [[H1980]] together. [[H3162]]

### 9
When they arrived [[H935]] at [[H413]] the place [[H4725]] God [[H430]] had designated, [[H559]] Abraham [[H85]] built [[H1129]] the altar [[H4196]] there [[H8033]] and arranged [[H6186]] the wood. [[H6086]] He bound [[H6123]] his son [[H1121]] Isaac [[H3327]] and placed [[H7760]] him on [[H5921]] the altar, [[H4196]] atop [[H4605]] the wood. [[H6086]]

### 10
Then Abraham [[H85]] reached out [[H7971]] his hand [[H3027]] and took [[H3947]] the knife [[H3979]] to slaughter [[H7819]] his son. [[H1121]]

### 11
Just then, the Angel [[H4397]] of the LORD [[H3068]] called out [[H7121]] to [[H413]] him from [[H4480]] heaven, [[H8064]] “Abraham, [[H85]] Abraham!” [[H85]] “Here I am,” [[H2009]] he replied. [[H559]]

### 12
“Do not [[H408]] lay [[H7971]] a hand [[H3027]] on [[H413]] the boy [[H5288]] or do [[H6213]] anything to him,” [[H3972]] said [the Angel], [[H559]] “for [[H3588]] now [[H6258]] I know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] you [[H859]] fear [[H3373]] God, [[H430]] since you have not [[H3808]] withheld [[H2820]] your only [[H3173]] son [[H1121]] from Me.” [[H4480]]

### 13
Then Abraham [[H85]] lifted up [[H5375]] his eyes [[H5869]] and saw [[H7200]] behind [him] [[H310]] a ram [[H352]] in the thicket, [[H5442]] caught [[H270]] by its horns. [[H7161]] So [he] [[H85]] went [[H1980]] and took [[H3947]] the ram [[H352]] and offered [[H5927]] it as a burnt offering [[H5930]] in place of [[H8478]] his son. [[H1121]]

### 14
And Abraham [[H85]] called [[H7121]] that [[H1931]] place [[H4725]] The LORD [[H3068]] Will Provide. [[H7200]] So [[H834]] to this day [[H3117]] it is said, [[H559]] “On the mountain [[H2022]] of the LORD [[H3068]] it will be provided.” [[H7200]]

### 15
And the Angel [[H4397]] of the LORD [[H3068]] called [[H7121]] to [[H413]] Abraham [[H85]] from [[H4480]] heaven [[H8064]] a second time, [[H8145]]

### 16
saying, [[H559]] “By Myself  I have sworn, [[H7650]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD, [[H3068]] that [[H3588]] because [[H3282]] you have done [[H6213]] this [[H2088]] and have not [[H3808]] withheld [[H2820]] your only [[H3173]] son, [[H1121]]

### 17
I will surely [[H3588]] bless you, [[H1288]] and I will multiply [[H7235]] your descendants [[H2233]] like the stars [[H3556]] in the sky [[H8064]] and the sand [[H2344]] on [[H5921]] the seashore. [[H8193]] Your descendants [[H2233]] will possess [[H3423]] the gates [[H8179]] of their enemies. [[H341]]

### 18
And through your offspring [[H2233]] all [[H3605]] nations [[H1471]] of the earth [[H776]] will be blessed, [[H1288]] because [[H6118]] you have obeyed [[H8085]] My voice.” [[H6963]]

### 19
Abraham [[H85]] went back [[H7725]] to [[H413]] his servants, [[H5288]] and they got up [[H6965]] and set out [[H1980]] together [[H3162]] for [[H413]] Beersheba. [[H884]] And Abraham [[H85]] settled [[H3427]] in Beersheba. [[H884]]

### 20
Some time later [[H1961]] Abraham [[H85]] was told, [[H5046]] “Milcah [[H4435]] has also [[H1571]] borne [[H3205]] sons [[H1121]] to your brother [[H251]] Nahor: [[H5152]]

### 21
Uz [[H5780]] the firstborn, [[H1060]] his brother [[H251]] Buz, [[H938]] Kemuel [[H7055]] the father [[H1]] of Aram, [[H758]]

### 22
Chesed, [[H3777]] Hazo, [[H2375]] Pildash, [[H6394]] Jidlaph, [[H3044]] and Bethuel.” [[H1328]]

### 23
And Bethuel [[H1328]] became the father of [[H3205]] Rebekah. [[H7259]] Milcah [[H4435]] bore [[H3205]] these [[H428]] eight [sons] [[H8083]] to Abraham’s [[H85]] brother [[H251]] Nahor. [[H5152]]

### 24
Moreover, [[H1571]] his concubine, [[H6370]] whose name [[H8034]] was Reumah, [[H7208]] bore [[H3205]] Tebah, [[H2875]] Gaham, [[H1514]] Tahash, [[H8477]] and Maacah. [[H4601]]
