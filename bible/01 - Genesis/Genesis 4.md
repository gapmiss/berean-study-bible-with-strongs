### 1
And Adam [[H120]] had relations with [[H3045]] his wife [[H802]] Eve, [[H2332]] and she conceived [[H2029]] and gave birth to [[H3205]] Cain. [[H7014]] “With the help of [[H854]] the LORD [[H3068]] I have brought forth [[H7069]] a man,” [[H376]] she said. [[H559]]

### 2
Later [[H3254]] she gave birth [[H3205]] to [Cain’s] brother [[H251]] Abel. [[H1893]] Now [[H1961]] Abel [[H1893]] was [[H1961]] a keeper [[H7462]] of sheep, [[H6629]] but Cain [[H7014]] was a tiller [[H5647]] of the soil. [[H127]]

### 3
So in the course [[H7093]] of time, [[H3117]] Cain [[H7014]] brought [[H935]] some of the fruit [[H6529]] of the soil [[H127]] as an offering [[H4503]] to the LORD, [[H3068]]

### 4
while Abel [[H1893]] brought [[H935]] the best portions [[H2459]] of the firstborn [[H1062]] of his flock. [[H6629]] And the LORD [[H3068]] looked with favor [[H8159]] on [[H413]] Abel [[H1893]] and [[H413]] his offering, [[H4503]]

### 5
but [[H413]] He had no [[H3808]] regard [[H8159]] for [[H413]] Cain [[H7014]] and his offering. [[H4503]] So Cain [[H7014]] became very [[H3966]] angry, [[H2734]] and his countenance [[H6440]] fell. [[H5307]]

### 6
“Why [[H4100]] are you angry,” [[H2734]] said [[H559]] the LORD [[H3068]] to [[H413]] Cain, [[H7014]] “and why [[H4100]] is your face [[H6440]] downcast? [[H5307]]

### 7
If [[H518]] you do what is right, [[H3190]] {will} [[H3808]] you not [[H3808]] be accepted? [[H7613]] But if [[H518]] you refuse to do what is right, [[H3190]] sin [[H2403]] is crouching [[H7257]] at your door; [[H6607]] you are [[H413]] its object of desire, [[H8669]] but you [[H859]] must master [[H4910]] it.” 

### 8
Then Cain [[H7014]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] his brother [[H251]] Abel, [“Let us go out to the field.”] [[H1893]] And [[H1961]] while they were [[H1961]] in the field, [[H7704]] Cain [[H7014]] rose up [[H6965]] against [[H413]] his brother [[H251]] Abel [[H1893]] and killed him. [[H2026]]

### 9
And the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Cain, [[H7014]] “Where [[H335]] [is] your brother [[H251]] Abel?” [[H1893]] “I [[H595]] do not [[H3808]] know!” [[H3045]] he answered. [[H559]] “[Am] I my brother’s [[H251]] keeper?” [[H8104]]

### 10
“What [[H4100]] have you done?” [[H6213]] replied [the LORD]. [[H559]] “The voice [[H6963]] of your brother’s [[H251]] blood [[H1818]] cries out [[H6817]] to Me [[H413]] from [[H4480]] the ground. [[H127]]

### 11
Now [[H6258]] you [[H859]] [are] cursed and banished [[H779]] from [[H4480]] the ground, [[H127]] which [[H834]] has opened [[H6475]] its mouth [[H6310]] to receive [[H3947]] your brother’s [[H251]] blood [[H1818]] from your hand. [[H3027]]

### 12
When [[H3588]] you till [[H5647]] the ground, [[H127]] {it will} no [[H3808]] longer [[H3254]] yield [[H5414]] its produce [[H3581]] to you.  You will be [[H1961]] a fugitive [[H5128]] and a wanderer [[H5110]] on the earth.” [[H776]]

### 13
But Cain [[H7014]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] the LORD, [[H3068]] “My punishment [[H5771]] [is] greater [[H1419]] than I can bear. [[H5375]]

### 14
Behold, [[H2005]] this [[H853]] day [[H3117]] You have driven me [[H1644]] from the face [[H6440]] of the earth, [[H127]] and from [[H5921]] Your face [[H6440]] I will be hidden; [[H5641]] I {will} be [[H1961]] a fugitive [[H5128]] and a wanderer [[H5110]] on the earth, [[H776]] and [[H1961]] whoever [[H3605]] finds me [[H4672]] {will} kill me.” [[H2026]]

### 15
“Not so!” [[H3651]] replied [[H559]] the LORD. [[H3068]] “If anyone [[H3605]] slays [[H2026]] Cain, [[H7014]] [then Cain] will be avenged [[H5358]] sevenfold.” [[H7659]] And the LORD [[H3068]] placed [[H7760]] a mark [[H226]] on Cain, [[H7014]] so that no one [[H1115]] who found him [[H4672]] would kill [[H5221]] him. [[H853]]

### 16
So Cain [[H7014]] went out [[H3318]] from the presence [[H6440]] of the LORD [[H3068]] and settled [[H3427]] in the land [[H776]] of Nod, [[H5113]] east [[H6926]] of Eden. [[H5731]]

### 17
And Cain [[H7014]] had relations with [[H3045]] his wife, [[H802]] and she conceived [[H2029]] and gave birth to [[H3205]] Enoch. [[H2585]] Then [[H1961]] [Cain] built [[H1129]] a city [[H5892]] and named [[H7121]] [it] [[H5892]] after [[H8034]] his son [[H1121]] Enoch. [[H2585]]

### 18
Now to Enoch [[H2585]] was born [[H3205]] Irad, [[H5897]] and Irad [[H5897]] was the father of [[H3205]] Mehujael, [[H4232]] and Mehujael [[H4232]] was the father of [[H3205]] Methusael, [[H4967]] and Methusael [[H4967]] was the father of [[H3205]] Lamech. [[H3929]]

### 19
And Lamech [[H3929]] married [[H3947]] two [[H8147]] women, [[H802]] one [[H259]] named [[H8034]] Adah [[H5711]] and [[H8034]] the other [[H8145]] Zillah. [[H6741]]

### 20
And Adah [[H5711]] gave birth to [[H3205]] Jabal; [[H2989]] he [[H1931]] was [[H1961]] the father [[H1]] of those who dwell [[H3427]] in tents [[H168]] and [raise] livestock. [[H4735]]

### 21
And his brother’s [[H251]] name [[H8034]] [was] Jubal; [[H3106]] he [[H1931]] was [[H1961]] the father [[H1]] of all [[H3605]] who play [[H8610]] the harp [[H3658]] and flute. [[H5748]]

### 22
Zillah [[H6741]] also [[H1571]] gave birth to [[H3205]] Tubal-cain, [[H8423]] a forger [[H3913]] of every [[H3605]] implement [[H2794]] of bronze [[H5178]] and iron. [[H1270]] And the sister [[H269]] of Tubal-cain [[H8423]] [was] Naamah. [[H5279]]

### 23
Then Lamech [[H3929]] said [[H559]] to his wives: [[H802]] “Adah [[H5711]] and Zillah, [[H6741]] hear [[H8085]] my voice; [[H6963]] wives [[H802]] of Lamech, [[H3929]] listen [[H238]] to my speech. [[H565]] For [[H3588]] I [[H582]] have slain [a man] [[H2026]] for wounding me, [[H6482]] a young man [[H3206]] for striking me. [[H2250]]

### 24
If [[H3588]] Cain [[H7014]] is avenged [[H5358]] sevenfold, [[H7659]] then Lamech [[H3929]] seventy-sevenfold.” [[H7651]]

### 25
And Adam again had relations with [[H3045]] his wife, [[H802]] and she gave birth to [[H3205]] a son [[H1121]] and named him [[H7121]] Seth, [[H8352]] saying, [[H3588]] “God [[H430]] has granted [[H7896]] me  another [[H312]] seed [[H2233]] in place [[H8478]] of Abel, [[H1893]] since [[H3588]] Cain [[H7014]] killed him.” [[H2026]]

### 26
And to Seth [[H8352]] also [[H1571]] a son [[H1121]] was born, [[H3205]] and he called [[H7121]] him [[H8034]] Enosh. [[H583]] At that time [[H227]] [men] began [[H2490]] to call upon [[H7121]] the name [[H8034]] of the LORD. [[H3068]]
