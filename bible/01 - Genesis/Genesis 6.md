### 1
Now [[H1961]] when [[H3588]] men [[H120]] began [[H2490]] to multiply [[H7231]] on [[H5921]] the face [[H6440]] of the earth [[H127]] and daughters [[H1323]] were born [[H3205]] to them, 

### 2
the sons [[H1121]] of God [[H430]] saw that [[H7200]] the daughters [[H1323]] of men [[H120]] [were] beautiful, [[H2896]] and they took [[H3947]] as wives [[H802]] whomever [[H834]] they chose. [[H977]]

### 3
So the LORD [[H3068]] said, [[H559]] “My Spirit [[H7307]] {will} not [[H3808]] contend [[H1777]] with man [[H120]] forever, [[H5769]] for [[H1571]] he [is] [[H1931]] mortal; [[H1320]] his days [[H3117]] {shall} be [[H1961]] 120 [[H3967]] years.” [[H8141]]

### 4
The Nephilim [[H5303]] were [[H1961]] on the earth [[H776]] in those days, [[H3117]] and [[H1571]] afterward as well, [[H310]] when [[H834]] the sons [[H1121]] of God [[H430]] had relations with [[H935]] the daughters [[H1323]] of men. [[H120]] And they bore [[H3205]] them  [children] who [[H1992]] [became] the mighty men [[H1368]] of old, [[H5769]] men of renown. [[H8034]]

### 5
Then the LORD [[H3068]] saw [[H7200]] that [[H3588]] the wickedness [[H7451]] of man [[H120]] [was] great [[H7227]] upon the earth, [[H776]] and [that] every [[H3605]] inclination [[H3336]] of the thoughts [[H4284]] of his heart [[H3820]] [was] altogether [[H7535]] evil [[H7451]] all [[H3605]] the time. [[H3117]]

### 6
And the LORD [[H3068]] regretted [[H5162]] that [[H3588]] He had made [[H6213]] man [[H120]] on the earth, [[H776]] and it grieved Him [[H6087]] in [[H413]] His heart. [[H3820]]

### 7
So the LORD [[H3068]] said, [[H559]] “I will blot out [[H4229]] man, [[H120]] whom [[H834]] I have created, [[H1254]] from [[H5921]] the face [[H6440]] of the earth— [[H127]] every man [[H120]] and [[H5704]] beast [[H929]] and [[H5704]] crawling creature [[H7431]] and bird [[H5775]] of the air— [[H8064]] for [[H3588]] I am grieved [[H5162]] that [[H3588]] I have made them.” [[H6213]]

### 8
Noah, however, [[H5146]] found [[H4672]] favor [[H2580]] in the eyes [[H5869]] of the LORD. [[H3068]]

### 9
This [is] [[H428]] the account [[H8435]] of Noah. [[H5146]] Noah [[H5146]] was [[H1961]] a righteous man, [[H6662]] blameless [[H8549]] in his generation; [[H1755]] Noah [[H5146]] walked [[H1980]] with [[H854]] God. [[H430]]

### 10
And [[H853]] Noah [[H5146]] had [[H3205]] three [[H7969]] sons: [[H1121]] Shem, [[H8035]] Ham, [[H2526]] and Japheth. [[H3315]]

### 11
Now the earth [[H776]] was corrupt [[H7843]] in the sight [[H6440]] of God, [[H430]] [and] [[H776]] full [[H4390]] of violence. [[H2555]]

### 12
And God [[H430]] looked [[H7200]] upon the earth [[H776]] and saw that [[H2009]] it was corrupt; [[H7843]] for [[H3588]] all [[H3605]] living creatures [[H1320]] on [[H5921]] the earth [[H776]] had corrupted [[H7843]] their ways. [[H1870]]

### 13
Then God [[H430]] said [[H559]] to Noah, [[H5146]] “The end [[H7093]] of all [[H3605]] living creatures [[H1320]] has come [[H935]] before Me, [[H6440]] because [[H3588]] through them [[H6440]] the earth [[H776]] is full of [[H4390]] violence. [[H2555]] Now behold, [[H2005]] I will destroy both them [[H7843]] and [[H854]] the earth. [[H776]]

### 14
Make [[H6213]] for yourself  an ark [[H8392]] of gopher [[H1613]] wood; [[H6086]] make [[H6213]] rooms [[H7064]] in [[H854]] the ark [[H8392]] and coat it with pitch [[H3722]] inside [[H1004]] and out. [[H2351]]

### 15
And this [[H2088]] is how [[H834]] you are to build [[H6213]] it: [[H853]] The ark [[H8392]] [is to be] 300 [[H7969]] cubits [[H520]] long, [[H753]] 50 [[H2572]] cubits [[H520]] wide, [[H7341]] and 30 [[H7970]] cubits [[H520]] high. [[H6967]]

### 16
You are to make [[H6213]] a roof [[H6672]] for the ark, [[H8392]] finish [its walls] [[H3615]] a cubit [[H520]] from the top, [[H4605]] place [[H7760]] a door [[H6607]] in the side [[H6654]] of the ark, [[H8392]] and build [[H6213]] lower, [[H8482]] middle, [[H8145]] and upper {decks}. [[H7992]]

### 17
And [[H589]] behold, [[H2005]] I will bring [[H935]] floodwaters [[H3999]] upon [[H5921]] the earth, [[H776]] to destroy [[H7843]] every [[H3605]] creature [[H1320]] under [[H8478]] the heavens [[H8064]] that has [[H834]] the breath [[H7307]] of life. [[H2416]] Everything [[H3605]] on the earth [[H776]] will perish. [[H1478]]

### 18
But I will establish [[H6965]] My covenant [[H1285]] with you, [[H854]] and you {will} enter [[H935]] the ark— [[H8392]] you [[H859]] and your sons [[H1121]] and your wife [[H802]] and your sons’ [[H1121]] wives [[H802]] with you. [[H854]]

### 19
And [[H3605]] you are to bring [[H935]] two [[H8147]] of every [[H3605]] living thing [[H2416]] into [[H413]] the ark— [[H8392]] male [[H2145]] and female— [[H5347]] to keep [them] alive [[H2421]] with you. [[H854]]

### 20
Two [[H8147]] of every kind [[H3605]] of [[H4480]] bird [[H5775]] and animal [[H929]] [and] [[H3605]] crawling creature [[H7431]] {will} come [[H935]] to you [[H413]] to be kept alive. [[H2421]]

### 21
You are also [[H859]] to take [[H3947]] for yourself [[H413]] every kind [[H3605]] of food [[H3978]] that [[H834]] is eaten [[H398]] and gather [it] [[H622]] as food for yourselves [[H402]] [and] for [the animals].” 

### 22
So Noah [[H5146]] did [[H6213]] everything [[H3605]] precisely as [[H3651]] God [[H430]] had commanded [[H6680]] him. [[H853]]
