###### 1
Now Jacob [[H3290]] lived [[H3427]] in the land [[H776]] where his father [[H1]] had resided, [[H4033]] the land [[H776]] of Canaan. [[H3667]]

###### 2
This [[H428]] is the account [[H8435]] of Jacob. [[H3290]] When Joseph [[H3130]] [was] seventeen [[H7651]] years [[H8141]] old, [[H1121]] he was [[H1961]] tending [[H7462]] the flock [[H6629]] with [[H854]] his brothers, [[H251]] the sons [[H1121]] of Bilhah [[H1090]] and Zilpah, [[H2153]] his father’s [[H1]] wives, [[H802]] and he [[H3130]] brought [[H935]] their father [[H1]] a bad [[H7451]] report [[H1681]] about them. [[H413]]

###### 3
Now Israel [[H3478]] loved [[H157]] Joseph [[H3130]] more than [[H3605]] his other sons, [[H1121]] because [[H3588]] Joseph [[H1931]] had been born to him [[H1121]] in his old age; [[H2208]] so he made [[H6213]] him  a robe [[H3801]] of many colors. [[H6446]]

###### 4
When [Joseph’s] brothers [[H251]] saw [[H7200]] that [[H3588]] their father [[H1]] loved [[H157]] him [[H853]] more than any [[H3605]] [of them], [[H251]] they hated [[H8130]] him [[H853]] and could [[H3201]] not [[H3808]] speak [[H1696]] a kind word to him. [[H7965]]

###### 5
Then Joseph [[H3130]] had a dream, [[H2492]] and when he told [[H5046]] it to his brothers, [[H251]] they hated [[H8130]] him [[H853]] all the more. [[H3254]]

###### 6
He said [[H559]] to them, [[H413]] “Listen [[H8085]] to this [[H2088]] dream I had: [[H2492]]

###### 7
We [[H587]] were binding [[H481]] sheaves of grain [[H485]] in [[H8432]] the field, [[H7704]] and suddenly [[H2009]] my sheaf [[H485]] rose [[H6965]] and [[H1571]] stood upright, [[H5324]] while your sheaves [[H485]] gathered around [[H5437]] and bowed down [[H7812]] to [mine].” [[H485]]

###### 8
“Do you intend to [[H4427]] reign [[H4427]] over us?” [[H5921]] his brothers [[H251]] asked. [[H559]] “Will you actually [[H4910]] rule [[H4910]] us?”  So they hated [[H8130]] him [[H853]] even more [[H3254]] because of [[H5921]] his dream [[H2472]] and his statements. [[H1697]]

###### 9
Then [Joseph] had another [[H5750]] dream [[H2492]] and told [[H5608]] it to his brothers. [[H251]] “Look,” [[H2009]] he said, [[H559]] “I had another [[H5750]] dream, [[H2492]] and this time the sun [[H8121]] and moon [[H3394]] and eleven [[H259]] stars [[H3556]] were bowing down to me.” [[H7812]]

###### 10
He told [[H5608]] his father [[H1]] and brothers, [[H251]] but his father [[H1]] rebuked him. [[H1605]] “What [[H4100]] is this dream [[H2088]] that [[H834]] you have had?” [[H2472]] he said. [[H559]] “Will your mother [[H517]] and brothers [[H251]] and I [[H589]] actually [[H935]] come [[H935]] and bow down [[H7812]] to the ground [[H776]] before you?” 

###### 11
And his brothers [[H251]] were jealous of him, [[H7065]] but his father [[H1]] kept in mind [[H8104]] what he had said. [[H1697]]

###### 12
Some time later, [Joseph’s] brothers [[H251]] had gone [[H1980]] to pasture [[H7462]] their father’s [[H1]] flocks [[H6629]] near Shechem. [[H7927]]

###### 13
Israel [[H3478]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] [him], [[H3130]] “Are not [[H3808]] your brothers [[H251]] pasturing [[H7462]] the flocks at Shechem? [[H7927]] Get ready; [[H1980]] I am sending [[H7971]] you to them.” [[H413]] “I am ready,” [[H2009]] Joseph replied. [[H559]]

###### 14
Then [Israel] told him, [[H559]] “Go [[H1980]] now [[H4994]] and see [[H7200]] how your brothers [[H251]] and the flocks [[H6629]] are faring, [[H7965]] and bring word [[H1697]] back to me.” [[H7725]] So he sent him off [[H7971]] from the Valley [[H6010]] of Hebron. [[H2275]] And when [Joseph] arrived [[H935]] in Shechem, [[H7927]]

###### 15
a man [[H582]] found him [[H4672]] wandering [[H8582]] in the field [[H7704]] and asked, [[H7592]] “What [[H4100]] are you looking for?” [[H1245]]

###### 16
“I am [[H595]] looking for [[H1245]] my brothers,” [[H251]] Joseph replied. [[H559]] “Can you please tell me [[H5046]] where [[H375]] they [[H1992]] are pasturing their flocks?” [[H7462]]

###### 17
“They have moved on [[H5265]] from here,” [[H2088]] the man [[H376]] answered. [[H559]] “I heard [[H8085]] them say, [[H559]] ‘Let us go [[H1980]] to Dothan.’” [[H1886]] So Joseph [[H3130]] set out [[H1980]] after [[H310]] his brothers [[H251]] and found them [[H4672]] at Dothan. [[H1886]]

###### 18
Now [Joseph’s brothers] saw [[H7200]] him [[H853]] in the distance, [[H7350]] and before [[H2962]] he arrived, [[H7126]] they plotted [[H5230]] to kill him. [[H4191]]

###### 19
“Here [[H2009]] comes [[H935]] that [[H1976]] dreamer!” [[H1167]] they said [[H559]] to [[H413]] one [[H376]] another. [[H251]]

###### 20
“Come [[H1980]] now, [[H6258]] let us kill [[H2026]] him and throw [[H7993]] him into one [[H259]] of the pits. [[H953]] We can say [[H559]] that a vicious [[H7451]] animal [[H2416]] has devoured him. [[H398]] Then we shall see [[H7200]] what [[H4100]] becomes [[H1961]] of his dreams!” [[H2472]]

###### 21
When Reuben [[H7205]] heard [this], [[H8085]] he tried to rescue [Joseph] [[H5337]] from their hands. [[H3027]] “Let us not [[H3808]] take [[H5221]] his life,” [[H5315]] he said. [[H559]]

###### 22
“Do not shed [[H8210]] [his] blood. [[H1818]] Throw [[H7993]] him into [[H413]] this [[H2088]] pit [[H953]] in the wilderness, [[H4057]] but do not [[H408]] lay [[H7971]] a hand [[H3027]] on him.”  Reuben [[H7205]] said this [[H559]] so that [[H4616]] he could rescue [[H5337]] [Joseph] [[H853]] from their hands [[H3027]] and return [[H7725]] him to [[H413]] his father. [[H1]]

###### 23
So [[H1961]] when [[H834]] Joseph [[H3130]] came [[H935]] to [[H413]] his brothers, [[H251]] they stripped [[H6584]] [him] [[H3130]] of his robe— [[H3801]] the robe [[H3801]] of many colors [[H6446]] he was wearing— [[H5921]]

###### 24
and they took [[H3947]] him and threw [[H7993]] him into the pit. [[H953]] Now the pit [[H953]] was empty, [[H7386]] with no [[H369]] water [[H4325]] in it. 

###### 25
And as they sat down [[H3427]] to eat [[H398]] a meal, [[H3899]] they looked up [[H5375]] and saw [[H2009]] a caravan [[H736]] of Ishmaelites [[H3459]] coming [[H935]] from Gilead. [[H1568]] Their camels [[H1581]] were carrying [[H5375]] spices, [[H5219]] balm, [[H6875]] and myrrh [[H3910]] on their way [[H1980]] down [[H3381]] to Egypt. [[H4714]]

###### 26
Then Judah [[H3063]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] his brothers, [[H251]] “What [[H4100]] profit will we gain [[H1215]] if [[H3588]] we kill [[H2026]] our brother [[H251]] and cover up [[H3680]] his blood? [[H1818]]

###### 27
Come, [[H1980]] let us sell [[H4376]] him to the Ishmaelites [[H3459]] and not [[H408]] lay [[H1961]] a hand on him; [[H3027]] for [[H3588]] he [[H1931]] is our brother, [[H251]] our own flesh.” [[H1320]] And they [[H251]] agreed. [[H8085]]

###### 28
So when the Midianite [[H4084]] traders [[H5503]] passed by, [[H5674]] his brothers pulled [[H4900]] Joseph [[H3130]] out of [[H4480]] the pit [[H953]] and sold [[H4376]] him [[H3130]] for twenty [shekels] [[H6242]] of silver [[H3701]] to the Ishmaelites, [[H3459]] who took [[H935]] [him] [[H3130]] to Egypt. [[H4714]]

###### 29
When Reuben [[H7205]] returned [[H7725]] to [[H413]] the pit [[H953]] and saw [[H2009]] that Joseph [[H3130]] was not there, [[H369]] he tore [[H7167]] his clothes, [[H899]]

###### 30
returned [[H7725]] to [[H413]] his brothers, [[H251]] and said, [[H559]] “The boy [[H3206]] is gone! [[H369]] What am I going to do?” [[H589]]

###### 31
Then they took [[H3947]] Joseph’s [[H3130]] robe, [[H3801]] slaughtered [[H7819]] a young goat, [[H8163]] and dipped [[H2881]] the robe [[H3801]] in its blood. [[H1818]]

###### 32
They sent [[H7971]] the robe [[H3801]] of many colors [[H6446]] to [[H413]] their father [[H1]] and said, [[H559]] “We found [[H4672]] this. [[H2063]] Examine it [[H5234]] to see whether [[H4994]] it [is] [[H1931]] your son’s [[H1121]] robe [[H3801]] or [[H518]] not.” [[H3808]]

###### 33
His father recognized it [[H5234]] and said, [[H559]] “It is my son’s [[H1121]] robe! [[H3801]] A vicious [[H7451]] animal [[H2416]] has devoured him. [[H398]] Joseph [[H3130]] has surely been torn to pieces!” [[H2963]]

###### 34
Then Jacob [[H3290]] tore [[H7167]] his clothes, [[H8071]] put [[H7760]] sackcloth [[H8242]] around his waist, [[H4975]] and mourned [[H56]] for [[H5921]] his son [[H1121]] many [[H7227]] days. [[H3117]]

###### 35
All [[H3605]] his sons [[H1121]] and daughters [[H1323]] tried to comfort him, [[H5162]] but he refused [[H3985]] to be comforted. [[H5162]] “No,” he said. [[H559]] “I will go down [[H3381]] to Sheol [[H7585]] mourning [[H57]] for [[H413]] my son.” [[H1121]] So his father [[H1]] wept [[H1058]] for him. [[H853]]

###### 36
Meanwhile, the Midianites [[H4084]] sold [[H4376]] [Joseph] [[H853]] in [[H413]] Egypt [[H4714]] to Potiphar, [[H6318]] an officer [[H5631]] of Pharaoh [[H6547]] [and] captain [[H8269]] of the guard. [[H2876]]
