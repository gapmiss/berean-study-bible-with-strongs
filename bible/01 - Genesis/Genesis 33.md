### 1
Now Jacob [[H3290]] looked up [[H5375]] and saw [[H7200]] Esau [[H6215]] coming [[H935]] toward him with [[H5973]] four [[H702]] hundred [[H3967]] men. [[H376]] So he divided [[H2673]] the children [[H3206]] among Leah, [[H3812]] Rachel, [[H7354]] and the two [[H8147]] maidservants. [[H8198]]

### 2
He put [[H7760]] the maidservants [[H8198]] and their [[H853]] children [[H3206]] in front, [[H7223]] Leah [[H3812]] and her children [[H3206]] next, [[H314]] and Rachel [[H7354]] and Joseph [[H3130]] at the rear. [[H314]]

### 3
But [Jacob] [[H1931]] himself went on [[H5674]] ahead [[H6440]] and bowed [[H7812]] to the ground [[H776]] seven [[H7651]] times [[H6471]] as [[H5704]] he approached [[H5066]] his brother. [[H251]]

### 4
Esau, however, [[H6215]] ran to him [[H7323]] and embraced him, [[H2263]] threw his arms around [[H5307]] his neck, [[H6677]] and kissed him. [[H5401]] And they both wept. [[H1058]]

### 5
When Esau looked up [[H5375]] and saw [[H7200]] the women [[H802]] and children, [[H3206]] he asked, [[H559]] “Who [[H4310]] are these [[H428]] with you?”  [Jacob] answered, [[H559]] “[These are] the children [[H3206]] God [[H430]] has graciously given [[H2603]] your servant.” [[H5650]]

### 6
Then the maidservants [[H8198]] and their [[H2007]] children [[H3206]] approached [[H5066]] and bowed down. [[H7812]]

### 7
Leah [[H3812]] and her children [[H3206]] also [[H1571]] approached [[H5066]] and bowed down, [[H7812]] and then [[H310]] Joseph [[H3130]] and Rachel [[H7354]] approached [[H5066]] and bowed down. [[H7812]]

### 8
“What [[H4310]] do you mean by sending this [[H2088]] whole [[H3605]] company [[H4264]] to meet me?” [[H6298]] asked Esau. [[H559]] “To find [[H4672]] favor [[H2580]] in your sight, [[H5869]] my lord,” [[H113]] [Jacob] answered. [[H559]]

### 9
“I already have [[H3426]] plenty, [[H7227]] my brother,” [[H251]] Esau [[H6215]] replied. [[H559]] “Keep [[H1961]] what belongs to you.” [[H834]]

### 10
But Jacob [[H3290]] insisted, [[H559]] “No, [[H408]] please! [[H4994]] If [[H518]] I have found [[H4672]] favor [[H2580]] in your sight, [[H5869]] then receive [[H3947]] this gift [[H4503]] from my hand. [[H3027]] For [[H5921]] indeed, [[H3588]] I have seen [[H7200]] your face, [[H6440]] and it is like seeing [[H7200]] the face [[H6440]] of God, [[H430]] since you have received me favorably. [[H7521]]

### 11
Please [[H4994]] take [[H3947]] my present [[H1293]] that [[H834]] was brought to you, [[H935]] because [[H3588]] God [[H430]] has been gracious [[H2603]] to me  and I have [[H3426]] all I need. [[H3605]] So Jacob pressed [[H6484]] him  until he accepted. [[H3947]]

### 12
Then Esau said, [[H559]] “Let us be on our way, [[H5265]] and I will go [[H1980]] ahead of you.” [[H5048]]

### 13
But Jacob replied, [[H559]] “My lord [[H113]] knows [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] the children [[H3206]] are frail, [[H7390]] and I must care for [[H5921]] sheep [[H6629]] and cattle [[H1241]] that are nursing their young. [[H5763]] If they are driven hard [[H1849]] for even a [[H259]] day, [[H3117]] all [[H3605]] the animals [[H6629]] will die. [[H4191]]

### 14
Please [[H4994]] let my lord [[H113]] go [[H5674]] ahead of [[H6440]] his servant. [[H5650]] I [[H589]] will continue [[H5095]] on slowly, [[H328]] at a comfortable pace [[H7272]] for the livestock [[H4399]] and children, [[H3206]] until [[H5704]] I come [[H935]] to [[H413]] my lord [[H113]] at Seir.” [[H8165]]

### 15
“Let me leave [[H3322]] some of [[H4480]] my [[H834]] people [[H5971]] with you,” [[H5973]] Esau [[H6215]] said. [[H559]] But [Jacob] replied, [[H559]] “Why [[H4100]] do that? [[H2088]] Let me find [[H4672]] favor [[H2580]] in the sight [[H5869]] of my lord.” [[H113]]

### 16
So that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] Esau [[H6215]] started on his way [[H1870]] back [[H7725]] to Seir, [[H8165]]

### 17
but Jacob [[H3290]] went on [[H5265]] to Succoth, [[H5523]] where he built [[H1129]] a house [[H1004]] for himself  and shelters [[H5521]] for his livestock; [[H4735]] that is why [[H5921]] the place [[H4725]] was called [[H7121]] Succoth. [[H5523]]

### 18
After Jacob [[H3290]] had come [[H935]] from  Paddan-aram, [[H6307]] he arrived [[H935]] safely [[H8003]] at the city [[H5892]] of Shechem [[H7927]] in the land [[H776]] of Canaan, [[H3667]] and he camped [[H2583]] just outside [[H6440]] the city. [[H5892]]

### 19
And the plot [[H2513]] of ground [[H7704]] where [[H834]] he pitched [[H5186]] his tent, [[H168]] he purchased [[H7069]] from [[H3027]] the sons [[H1121]] of Hamor, [[H2544]] Shechem’s [[H7927]] father, [[H1]] for a hundred [[H3967]] pieces of silver. [[H7192]]

### 20
There [[H8033]] he set up [[H5324]] an altar [[H4196]] and called it [[H7121]] El-Elohe-Israel. [[H410]]
