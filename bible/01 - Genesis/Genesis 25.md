###### 1
Now Abraham [[H85]] had taken [[H3947]] another [[H3254]] wife, [[H802]] named [[H8034]] Keturah, [[H6989]]

###### 2
and she bore [[H3205]] him Zimran, [[H2175]] Jokshan, [[H3370]] Medan, [[H4091]] Midian, [[H4080]] Ishbak, [[H3435]] and Shuah. [[H7744]]

###### 3
Jokshan [[H3370]] was the father of [[H3205]] Sheba [[H7614]] and Dedan. [[H1719]] And the sons [[H1121]] of Dedan [[H1719]] were [[H1961]] the Asshurites, [[H805]] the Letushites, [[H3912]] and the Leummites. [[H3817]]

###### 4
The sons [[H1121]] of Midian [[H4080]] were Ephah, [[H5891]] Epher, [[H6081]] Hanoch, [[H2585]] Abida, [[H28]] and Eldaah. [[H420]] All [[H3605]] these [[H428]] were descendants [[H1121]] of Keturah. [[H6989]]

###### 5
Abraham [[H85]] left [[H5414]] everything [[H3605]] he owned to Isaac. [[H3327]]

###### 6
But while he was still [[H5750]] alive, [[H2416]] Abraham [[H85]] gave [[H5414]] gifts [[H4979]] to the sons [[H1121]] of his [[H834]] concubines [[H6370]] and sent them away [[H7971]] from [[H5921]] his son [[H1121]] Isaac [[H3327]] to [[H413]] the land [[H776]] of the east. [[H6924]]

###### 7
Abraham [[H85]] lived [[H2416]] a total of [[H428]] 175 [[H3967]] years. [[H8141]]

###### 8
And at a ripe [[H2896]] old age [[H7872]] he breathed his last [[H1478]] and died, [[H4191]] old [[H2205]] and contented, [[H7649]] and was gathered [[H622]] to [[H413]] his people. [[H5971]]

###### 9
His sons [[H1121]] Isaac [[H3327]] and Ishmael [[H3458]] buried [[H6912]] him in [[H413]] the cave [[H4631]] of Machpelah [[H4375]] near [[H5921]] Mamre, [[H4471]] in [[H413]] the field [[H7704]] of Ephron [[H6085]] son [[H1121]] of Zohar [[H6714]] the Hittite. [[H2850]]

###### 10
This was the field [[H7704]] that [[H834]] Abraham [[H85]] had bought [[H7069]] from the Hittites. [[H1121]] Abraham [[H85]] was buried [[H6912]] there [[H8033]] with his wife [[H802]] Sarah. [[H8283]]

###### 11
After [[H310]] Abraham’s [[H85]] death, [[H4194]] God [[H430]] blessed [[H1288]] his son [[H1121]] Isaac, [[H3327]] who [[H3327]] lived [[H3427]] near [[H5973]] Beer-lahai-roi. [[H883]]

###### 12
This [[H428]] is the account [[H8435]] of Abraham’s [[H85]] son [[H1121]] Ishmael, [[H3458]] whom [[H834]] Hagar [[H1904]] the Egyptian, [[H4713]] Sarah’s [[H8283]] maidservant, [[H8198]] bore [[H3205]] to Abraham. [[H85]]

###### 13
These [[H428]] are the names [[H8034]] of the sons [[H1121]] of Ishmael [[H3458]] in the order of their birth: [[H8435]] Nebaioth [[H5032]] the firstborn [[H1060]] of Ishmael, [[H3458]] then Kedar, [[H6938]] Adbeel, [[H110]] Mibsam, [[H4017]]

###### 14
Mishma, [[H4927]] Dumah, [[H1746]] Massa, [[H4854]]

###### 15
Hadad, [[H2301]] Tema, [[H8485]] Jetur, [[H3195]] Naphish, [[H5305]] and Kedemah. [[H6929]]

###### 16
These [[H428]] were [[H1992]] the sons [[H1121]] of Ishmael, [[H3458]] and these [[H428]] were their names [[H8034]] by their villages [[H2691]] and encampments— [[H2918]] twelve [[H8147]] princes [[H5387]] of their tribes. [[H523]]

###### 17
Ishmael [[H3458]] lived [[H2416]] a total of [[H428]] 137 [[H3967]] years. [[H8141]] Then he breathed his last [[H1478]] and died, [[H4191]] and was gathered [[H622]] to [[H413]] his people. [[H5971]]

###### 18
[Ishmael’s descendants] settled [[H7931]] from Havilah [[H2341]] to [[H5704]] Shur, [[H7793]] which [[H834]] is near [[H5921]] the border [[H6440]] of Egypt [[H4714]] as you go [[H935]] toward Asshur. [[H804]] And they lived [[H5307]] in hostility [[H5921]] toward [[H6440]] all [[H3605]] their brothers. [[H251]]

###### 19
This [[H428]] is the account [[H8435]] of Abraham's [[H85]] son [[H1121]] Isaac. [[H3327]] Abraham [[H85]] became the father of [[H3205]] Isaac, [[H3327]]

###### 20
and Isaac [[H3327]] was [[H1961]] forty [[H705]] years old [[H1121]] when he married [[H3947]] Rebekah, [[H7259]] the daughter [[H1323]] of Bethuel [[H1328]] the Aramean [[H761]] from  Paddan-aram [[H6307]] and the sister [[H269]] of Laban [[H3837]] the Aramean. [[H761]]

###### 21
Later, Isaac [[H3327]] prayed [[H6279]] to the LORD [[H3068]] on behalf of [[H5227]] his wife, [[H802]] because [[H3588]] she [[H1931]] [was] barren. [[H6135]] And the LORD [[H3068]] heard his prayer, [[H6279]] and his wife [[H802]] Rebekah [[H7259]] conceived. [[H2029]]

###### 22
But the children [[H1121]] inside her [[H7130]] struggled with each other, [[H7533]] and she said, [[H559]] “Why [[H4100]] is this [[H2088]] happening to me?” [[H595]] So [Rebekah] went [[H1980]] to inquire [[H1875]] of the LORD, [[H3068]]

###### 23
and [He] [[H3068]] declared  to her: [[H559]] “Two [[H8147]] nations [[H1471]] are in your womb, [[H990]] and two [[H8147]] peoples [[H3816]] from within you [[H4578]] will be separated; [[H6504]] one people [[H3816]] will be stronger [[H553]] than the other, [[H3816]] and the older [[H7227]] will serve [[H5647]] the younger.” [[H6810]]

###### 24
When her time [[H3117]] came [[H4390]] to give birth, [[H3205]] there were indeed [[H2009]] twins [[H8380]] in her womb. [[H990]]

###### 25
The first [[H7223]] one came out [[H3318]] red, [[H132]] covered with hair [[H8181]] like a fur coat; [[H155]] so they named [[H7121]] him Esau. [[H6215]]

###### 26
After [[H310]] this, [[H3651]] his brother [[H251]] came out [[H3318]] grasping [[H270]] Esau’s [[H6215]] heel; [[H6119]] so he was named [[H7121]] Jacob. [[H3290]] And Isaac [[H3327]] was sixty [[H8346]] years old [[H1121]] when [the twins] were born. [[H3205]]

###### 27
When the boys [[H5288]] grew up, [[H1431]] Esau [[H6215]] became [[H1961]] a skillful [[H3045]] hunter, [[H6718]] a man [[H376]] of the field, [[H7704]] but Jacob [[H3290]] was a quiet [[H8535]] man [[H376]] who stayed [[H3427]] at home. [[H168]]

###### 28
Because [[H3588]] Isaac [[H3327]] had a taste [[H6310]] for wild game, [[H6718]] he loved [[H157]] Esau; [[H6215]] but Rebekah [[H7259]] loved [[H157]] Jacob. [[H3290]]

###### 29
One day, while Jacob [[H3290]] was cooking [[H2102]] some stew, [[H5138]] Esau [[H6215]] came in [[H935]] from [[H4480]] the field [[H7704]] and [[H1931]] was famished. [[H5889]]

###### 30
He [[H6215]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Jacob, [[H3290]] “Let me eat [[H3938]] some of [[H4480]] that [[H2088]] red [[H122]] [stew], [[H122]] for [[H3588]] I am [[H595]] famished.” [[H5889]] (That is why [[H5921]] he was also called [[H7121]] Edom.) [[H123]]

###### 31
“First [[H3117]] sell [[H4376]] me  your birthright,” [[H1062]] Jacob [[H3290]] replied. [[H559]]

###### 32
“Look,” [[H2009]] said [[H559]] Esau, [[H6215]] “I am [[H595]] about to die, [[H1980]] so what good [[H4100]] is a birthright [[H1062]] to me?” 

###### 33
“Swear to me first,” [[H7650]] Jacob [[H3290]] said. [[H559]] So [Esau] swore [[H7650]] to Jacob and sold [[H4376]] him [[H3290]] the birthright. [[H1062]]

###### 34
Then Jacob [[H3290]] gave [[H5414]] some bread [[H3899]] and lentil [[H5742]] stew [[H5138]] to Esau; [[H6215]] he ate [[H398]] and drank, [[H8354]] and then got up [[H6965]] and went away. [[H1980]] Thus Esau [[H6215]] despised [[H959]] his birthright. [[H1062]]
