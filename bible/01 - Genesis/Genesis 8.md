### 1
But [[H853]] God [[H430]] remembered [[H2142]] Noah [[H5146]] and all [[H3605]] the animals [[H2416]] and [[H853]] livestock [[H929]] that [[H834]] were with [[H854]] him in the ark. [[H8392]] And [He] [[H430]] sent a wind [[H7307]] over [[H5921]] the earth, [[H776]] and the waters [[H4325]] began to subside. [[H7918]]

### 2
The springs [[H4599]] of the deep [[H8415]] and the floodgates [[H699]] of the heavens [[H8064]] were closed, [[H5534]] and the rain [[H1653]] from [[H4480]] the sky [[H8064]] was restrained. [[H3607]]

### 3
The waters [[H4325]] receded [[H7725]] steadily [[H1980]] from [[H5921]] the earth, [[H776]] and after [[H7097]] 150 [[H3967]] days [[H3117]] the waters [[H4325]] had gone down. [[H2637]]

### 4
On the seventeenth [[H7651]] day [[H3117]] of the seventh [[H7637]] month, [[H2320]] the ark [[H8392]] came to rest [[H5117]] on [[H5921]] the mountains [[H2022]] of Ararat. [[H780]]

### 5
And the waters [[H4325]] continued [[H1980]] to recede [[H2637]] until [[H5704]] the tenth [[H6224]] month, [[H2320]] [and] on the first [[H259]] day [[H2320]] of the tenth month, [[H6224]] the tops [[H7218]] of the mountains [[H2022]] became visible. [[H7200]]

### 6
After [[H7093]] forty [[H705]] days [[H3117]] Noah [[H5146]] opened [[H6605]] the window [[H2474]] he had made [[H6213]] in the ark [[H8392]]

### 7
and sent out [[H7971]] a raven. [[H6158]] It kept flying back and forth [[H3318]] until [[H5704]] the waters [[H4325]] had dried up [[H3001]] from [[H5921]] the earth. [[H776]]

### 8
Then [Noah] sent out [[H7971]] a dove [[H3123]] to see [[H7200]] if the waters [[H4325]] had receded [[H7043]] from [[H5921]] the surface [[H6440]] of the ground. [[H127]]

### 9
But the dove [[H3123]] found [[H4672]] no [[H3808]] place to rest [[H4494]] her foot, [[H3709]] and she returned [[H7725]] to [[H413]] him in [[H413]] the ark, [[H8392]] because [[H3588]] water [[H4325]] still covered [[H5921]] the surface [[H6440]] of the whole [[H3605]] earth. [[H776]] So he reached out [[H7971]] his hand [[H3027]] and brought [[H935]] her back [[H413]] inside [[H413]] the ark. [[H8392]]

### 10
[Noah] waited [[H2342]] seven [[H7651]] more [[H312]] days [[H3117]] and again [[H3254]] sent out [[H7971]] the dove [[H3123]] from [[H4480]] the ark. [[H8392]]

### 11
And behold, [[H2009]] the dove [[H3123]] returned [[H935]] to him [[H413]] in the evening [[H6256]] with a freshly plucked [[H2965]] olive [[H2132]] leaf [[H5929]] in her beak. [[H6310]] So Noah [[H5146]] knew [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] the waters [[H4325]] had receded [[H7043]] from [[H5921]] the earth. [[H776]]

### 12
[And] Noah waited [[H3176]] seven [[H7651]] more [[H312]] days [[H3117]] and sent out [[H7971]] the dove {again}, [[H3123]] but this time [[H3254]] she did not return [[H7725]] to him. [[H413]]

### 13
In [Noah’s] six [[H8337]] hundred [[H3967]] and first [[H259]] year, [[H8141]] on the first [[H259]] day [[H2320]] of the first month, [[H7223]] the water [[H4325]] had dried up [[H2717]] from [[H5921]] the earth. [[H776]] So Noah [[H5146]] removed [[H5493]] the covering [[H4372]] from the ark [[H8392]] and saw [[H7200]] that the surface [[H6440]] of the ground [[H127]] was dry. [[H2717]]

### 14
By the twenty-seventh [[H7651]] day [[H3117]] of the second [[H8145]] month, [[H2320]] the earth [[H776]] was fully dry. [[H3001]]

### 15
Then God [[H430]] said [[H1696]] to [[H413]] Noah, [[H5146]]

### 16
“Come out [[H3318]] of [[H4480]] the ark, [[H8392]] you [[H859]] and your wife [[H802]] and your sons [[H1121]] and your sons’ [[H1121]] wives. [[H802]]

### 17
Bring out [[H3318]] all [[H3605]] the living creatures [[H2416]] that [[H834]] are with you— [[H854]] birds, [[H5775]] livestock, [[H929]] and everything [[H3605]] that crawls [[H7430]] upon [[H5921]] the ground— [[H776]] so that they can spread out [[H8317]] over the earth [[H776]] and be fruitful [[H6509]] and multiply [[H7235]] upon [[H5921]] [it].” [[H776]]

### 18
So Noah [[H5146]] came out, [[H3318]] along with [[H854]] his sons [[H1121]] and his wife [[H802]] and his sons’ [[H1121]] wives. [[H802]]

### 19
Every [[H3605]] living creature, [[H2416]] every [[H3605]] creeping thing, [[H7431]] and every [[H3605]] bird— [[H5775]] everything [[H3605]] that moves [[H7430]] upon [[H5921]] the earth— [[H776]] came out [[H3318]] of [[H4480]] the ark, [[H8392]] kind by kind. [[H4940]]

### 20
Then Noah [[H5146]] built [[H1129]] an altar [[H4196]] to the LORD. [[H3068]] Taking [[H3947]] from every kind [[H3605]] of clean [[H2889]] animal [[H929]] and [[H3605]] clean [[H2889]] bird, [[H5775]] He offered [[H5927]] burnt offerings [[H5930]] on the altar. [[H4196]]

### 21
When the LORD [[H3068]] smelled [[H7306]] the pleasing [[H5207]] aroma, [[H7381]] He [[H3068]] said [[H559]] in [[H413]] His heart, [[H3820]] “Never again [[H3808]] will I curse [[H7043]] the ground [[H127]] because of [[H5668]] man, [[H120]] even though [[H3588]] every inclination [[H3336]] of [his] [[H120]] heart [[H3820]] is evil [[H7451]] from his youth. [[H5271]] And never [[H3808]] again [[H3254]] will I destroy [[H5221]] all [[H3605]] living creatures [[H2416]] as [[H834]] I have done. [[H6213]]

### 22
As long as [[H5750]] the earth endures, [[H776]] seedtime [[H2233]] and harvest, [[H7105]] cold [[H7120]] and heat, [[H2527]] summer [[H7019]] and winter, [[H2779]] day [[H3117]] and night [[H3915]] shall never [[H3808]] cease.” [[H7673]]
