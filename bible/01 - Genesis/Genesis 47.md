### 1
So Joseph [[H3130]] went [[H935]] and told [[H5046]] Pharaoh: [[H6547]] “My father [[H1]] and my brothers, [[H251]] with their flocks [[H6629]] and herds [[H1241]] and all [[H3605]] they own, [[H834]] have come [[H935]] from the land [[H776]] of Canaan [[H3667]] and are now [[H2005]] in Goshen.” [[H1657]]

### 2
And he chose [[H3947]] five [[H2568]] of [[H582]] his brothers [[H251]] and presented [[H3322]] them before [[H6440]] Pharaoh. [[H6547]]

### 3
“What [[H4100]] is your occupation?” [[H4639]] Pharaoh [[H6547]] asked [[H559]] [Joseph’s] brothers. [[H251]] “Your servants [[H5650]] are shepherds,” [[H7462]] they replied, [[H559]] “both [[H1571]] we [[H587]] and [[H1571]] our fathers.” [[H1]]

### 4
Then they said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Pharaoh, [[H6547]] “We have come [[H935]] to live in the land [[H776]] for a time, [[H1481]] because [[H3588]] there is no [[H369]] pasture [[H4829]] for the flock [[H6629]] of your servants, [[H5650]] since [[H3588]] the famine [[H7458]] in the land [[H776]] of Canaan [[H3667]] has been severe. [[H3515]] So now, [[H6258]] please [[H4994]] allow your servants [[H5650]] to settle [[H3427]] in the land [[H776]] of Goshen. [[H1657]]

### 5
Pharaoh [[H6547]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Joseph, [[H3130]] “Now that your father [[H1]] and brothers [[H251]] have come [[H935]] to you, [[H413]]

### 6
the land [[H776]] of Egypt [[H4714]] is before you; [[H6440]] settle [[H3427]] your father [[H1]] and brothers [[H251]] in the best [[H4315]] part of the land. [[H776]] They may dwell [[H3427]] in the land [[H776]] of Goshen. [[H1657]] And if [[H518]] you know of [[H3045]] any talented [[H2428]] men among them, [[H376]] put [[H7760]] them in charge of [[H8269]] my own livestock.” [[H4735]]

### 7
Then Joseph [[H3130]] brought in [[H935]] his father [[H1]] Jacob [[H3290]] and presented [[H5975]] him before [[H6440]] Pharaoh, [[H6547]] and Jacob [[H3290]] blessed [[H1288]] Pharaoh. [[H6547]]

### 8
“How many [[H4100]] years [[H3117]] have you lived?” [[H2416]] Pharaoh [[H6547]] asked. [[H559]]

### 9
“My pilgrimage [[H4033]] [has lasted] 130 [[H3967]] years,” [[H8141]] Jacob [[H3290]] replied. [[H559]] “My years [[H3117]] have been [[H1961]] few [[H4592]] and hard, [[H7451]] and they have not [[H3808]] matched [[H5381]] the years [[H3117]] of the lives [[H4033]] of my fathers.” [[H1]]

### 10
Then Jacob [[H3290]] blessed [[H1288]] Pharaoh [[H6547]] and departed [[H3318]] from [his] [[H6547]] presence. [[H6440]]

### 11
So Joseph [[H3130]] settled [[H3427]] his father [[H1]] and brothers [[H251]] in the land [[H776]] of Egypt [[H4714]] and gave them  property [[H272]] in the best [[H4315]] part of the land, [[H776]] the district [[H776]] of Rameses, [[H7486]] as [[H834]] Pharaoh [[H6547]] had commanded. [[H6680]]

### 12
Joseph also [[H3130]] provided [[H3557]] his father [[H1]] and [[H853]] brothers [[H251]] and all [[H3605]] his father’s [[H1]] household [[H1004]] with food [[H3899]] for [[H6310]] [their] families. [[H2945]]

### 13
Yet there was no [[H369]] food [[H3899]] throughout [[H3605]] that region, [[H776]] because [[H3588]] the famine [[H7458]] was so [[H3966]] severe; [[H3515]] the lands [[H776]] of Egypt [[H4714]] and [[H776]] Canaan [[H3667]] had been exhausted [[H3856]] by [[H6440]] the famine. [[H7458]]

### 14
Joseph [[H3130]] collected [[H3950]] all [[H3605]] the money [[H3701]] to be found [[H4672]] in the land [[H776]] of Egypt [[H4714]] and the land [[H776]] of Canaan [[H3667]] in exchange for the grain [[H7668]] they [[H1992]] were buying, [[H7666]] and he [[H3130]] brought [[H935]] [it] [[H3701]] into Pharaoh’s [[H6547]] palace. [[H1004]]

### 15
When the money [[H3701]] from the lands [[H776]] of Egypt [[H4714]] and [[H776]] Canaan [[H3667]] was gone, [[H8552]] all [[H3605]] the Egyptians [[H4713]] came [[H935]] to [[H413]] Joseph [[H3130]] and said, [[H559]] “Give [[H3051]] us  food. [[H3899]] Why [[H4100]] should we die [[H4191]] before your eyes? [[H5048]] For [[H3588]] our funds [[H3701]] have run out! [[H656]]

### 16
“Then bring me [[H3051]] your livestock,” [[H4735]] said [[H559]] Joseph. [[H3130]] “Since [[H518]] the money [[H3701]] is gone, [[H656]] I will sell [[H5414]] you food  in exchange for your livestock.” [[H4735]]

### 17
So they brought [[H935]] their livestock [[H4735]] to [[H413]] Joseph, [[H3130]] and he [[H3130]] gave [[H5414]] them  food [[H3899]] in exchange for their horses, [[H5483]] the animals [[H4735]] of their flocks [[H6629]] and herds, [[H1241]] and their donkeys. [[H2543]] Throughout that [[H1931]] year [[H8141]] he provided [[H5095]] them with food [[H3899]] in exchange for all [[H3605]] their livestock. [[H4735]]

### 18
When that [[H1931]] year [[H8141]] was over, [[H8552]] they came [[H935]] to him  the next [[H8145]] year [[H8141]] and said, [[H559]] “We cannot [[H3808]] hide [[H3582]] from our lord [[H113]] that [[H3588]] our money [[H3701]] is gone [[H8552]] and all our livestock [[H4735]] belongs to [[H413]] [you]. [[H113]] There is nothing [[H3808]] left [[H7604]] for [[H6440]] our lord [[H113]] except [[H1115]] our bodies [[H1472]] and our land. [[H127]]

### 19
Why [[H4100]] should we perish [[H4191]] before your eyes— [[H5869]] we [[H587]] and [[H1571]] our land [[H127]] as well? [[H1571]] Purchase [[H7069]] us [[H853]] and [[H853]] our land [[H127]] in exchange for food. [[H3899]] Then we, [[H587]] along with our land, [[H127]] will be [[H1961]] slaves [[H5650]] to Pharaoh. [[H6547]] Give [[H5414]] us seed [[H2233]] that we may live [[H2421]] and not [[H3808]] die, [[H4191]] and that the land [[H127]] may not [[H3808]] become desolate. [[H3456]]

### 20
So Joseph [[H3130]] acquired [[H7069]] for Pharaoh [[H6547]] all [[H3605]] the land [[H127]] in Egypt; [[H4714]] the Egyptians, [[H4713]] one and all, [[H582]] sold [[H4376]] their fields [[H7704]] because [[H3588]] the famine [[H7458]] was so severe [[H2388]] upon them. [[H5921]] The land [[H776]] became Pharaoh’s, [[H1961]]

### 21
and Joseph reduced [[H5674]] the people [[H5971]] to servitude [[H5892]] from one end [[H7097]] of Egypt [[H4714]] to [[H5704]] the other. [[H7097]]

### 22
However, [[H7535]] he did not [[H3808]] acquire [[H7069]] the priests’ portion [[H3548]] of the land, [[H127]] for [[H3588]] it had been given to them by Pharaoh. [[H6547]] They lived off [[H398]] the rations that [[H2706]] Pharaoh [[H6547]] supplied; [[H5414]] so [[H5921]] they did not [[H3808]] sell [[H4376]] their land. [[H127]]

### 23
Then Joseph [[H3130]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] the people, [[H5971]] “Now that [[H2005]] I have acquired [[H7069]] you and your land [[H127]] for Pharaoh [[H6547]] this day, [[H3117]] here [[H1887]] is seed [[H2233]] for you  to sow [[H2232]] in the land. [[H127]]

### 24
At harvest time, [[H8393]] you are to give [[H5414]] a fifth [[H2549]] of it to Pharaoh, [[H6547]] and four-fifths [[H702]] will be [[H1961]] yours  as seed [[H2233]] for the field [[H7704]] and food for yourselves [[H400]] and your households [[H1004]] and children.” [[H2945]]

### 25
“You have saved our lives,” [[H2421]] they said. [[H559]] “We have found [[H4672]] favor [[H2580]] in our lord’s [[H113]] eyes, [[H5869]] and will be [[H1961]] Pharaoh’s [[H6547]] servants.” [[H5650]]

### 26
So Joseph [[H3130]] established [[H7760]] a law [[H2706]] that a fifth [[H2569]] of the produce belongs to Pharaoh, [[H6547]] and it is in effect [[H5704]] in [[H5921]] the land [[H127]] of Egypt [[H4714]] to this [[H2088]] day. [[H3117]] Only [[H7535]] the priests’ [[H3548]] land [[H127]] does not [[H3808]] belong to [[H1961]] Pharaoh. [[H6547]]

### 27
Thus the Israelites [[H3478]] settled [[H3427]] in the land [[H776]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] in the region [[H776]] of Goshen. [[H1657]] They acquired property [[H270]] there  and became fruitful [[H6509]] and increased greatly [[H3966]] in number. [[H7235]]

### 28
And Jacob [[H3290]] lived [[H2421]] in the land [[H776]] of Egypt [[H4714]] seventeen [[H6240]] years, [[H8141]] and the length of his life [[H8141]] was [[H1961]] 147 [[H3967]] years. [[H8141]]

### 29
When the time [[H3117]] drew near [[H7126]] for Israel [[H3478]] to die, [[H4191]] he called [[H7121]] his son [[H1121]] Joseph [[H3130]] and said, [[H559]] “If [[H518]] I have found [[H4672]] favor [[H2580]] in your eyes, [[H5869]] put [[H7760]] your hand [[H3027]] under [[H8478]] my thigh [[H3409]] and promise me that you will show [[H6213]] me [[H5978]] kindness [[H2617]] and faithfulness. [[H571]] Do not [[H408]] bury me [[H6912]] in Egypt, [[H4714]]

### 30
but when I lie down [[H7901]] with [[H5973]] my fathers, [[H1]] carry me [[H5375]] out of Egypt [[H4714]] and bury me [[H6912]] with them.” [[H6900]] Joseph answered, [[H559]] “I [[H595]] will do [[H6213]] as you have requested.” [[H1697]]

### 31
“Swear [[H7650]] to me,”  Jacob said. [[H559]] So Joseph swore [[H7650]] to him,  and Israel [[H3478]] bowed [[H7812]] in worship at [[H5921]] the head [[H7218]] of his bed. [[H4296]]
