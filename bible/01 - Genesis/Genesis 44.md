### 1
Then Joseph instructed [[H6680]] his steward: [[H834]] “Fill the men’s [[H376]] sacks [[H572]] with [[H4390]] as much food [[H400]] as [[H834]] they can [[H3201]] carry, [[H5375]] and put [[H7760]] each one’s [[H376]] silver [[H3701]] in the mouth [[H6310]] of his bag. [[H572]]

### 2
Put [[H7760]] my cup, [[H1375]] the silver [[H3701]] one, [[H1375]] in the mouth [[H6310]] of the youngest one’s [[H6996]] sack, [[H572]] along with the silver [[H3701]] for his grain.” [[H7668]] So [the steward] did [[H6213]] as Joseph [[H3130]] told him. [[H1696]]

### 3
At daybreak, [[H1242]] the men [[H582]] were sent on their way [[H7971]] with their donkeys. [[H2543]]

### 4
They [[H1992]] had not [[H3808]] gone [[H3318]] far [[H7368]] from the city [[H5892]] when Joseph [[H3130]] told [[H559]] his steward, [[H834]] “Pursue [[H7291]] the men [[H376]] at once, [[H6965]] and when you overtake them, [[H5381]] ask, [[H559]] ‘Why [[H4100]] have you repaid [[H7999]] good [[H2896]] with evil? [[H7451]]

### 5
Is this not [[H3808]] the cup that [[H834]] my master [[H113]] drinks from [[H8354]] and uses for divination? [[H5172]] What [[H834]] you have done [[H6213]] is wicked!’” [[H7489]]

### 6
When [the steward] overtook them, [[H5381]] he repeated [[H1696]] these [[H428]] words [[H1697]] to them. [[H413]]

### 7
“Why [[H4100]] does my lord [[H113]] say [[H1696]] these [[H428]] things?” [[H1697]] they asked. [[H559]] “Your servants [[H5650]] could not possibly [[H2486]] do [[H6213]] such [[H2088]] a thing. [[H1697]]

### 8
We even brought back [[H7725]] to you [[H413]] from the land [[H776]] of Canaan [[H3667]] the money [[H3701]] we found [[H4672]] in the mouths [[H6310]] of our sacks. [[H572]] Why [[H349]] would we steal [[H1589]] gold [[H2091]] and [[H176]] silver [[H3701]] from your master’s [[H113]] house? [[H1004]]

### 9
If any [[H834]] of your servants [[H5650]] is found [[H4672]] to have it, [[H854]] he must die, [[H4191]] and the rest [[H587]] will become [[H1961]] slaves [[H5650]] of my lord.” [[H113]]

### 10
“As you say,” [[H1697]] replied the steward. [[H559]] “But only the one [[H1931]] who [[H834]] is found [[H4672]] with [the cup] [[H854]] will be [[H1961]] my  slave, [[H5650]] and the rest of you [[H859]] shall be [[H1961]] free of blame.” [[H5355]]

### 11
So each [[H376]] one quickly [[H4116]] lowered [[H3381]] his sack [[H572]] to the ground [[H776]] and opened [[H6605]] it. [[H572]]

### 12
The steward searched, [[H2664]] beginning [[H2490]] with the oldest [[H1419]] and ending [[H3615]] with the youngest— [[H6996]] and the cup [[H1375]] was found [[H4672]] in Benjamin’s [[H1144]] sack. [[H572]]

### 13
Then they all tore [[H7167]] their clothes, [[H8071]] loaded [[H6006]] their donkeys, [[H2543]] and returned [[H7725]] to the city. [[H5892]]

### 14
When Judah [[H3063]] and his brothers [[H251]] arrived at [[H935]] Joseph’s [[H3130]] house, [[H1004]] he [[H1931]] was still [[H5750]] there, [[H8033]] and they fell [[H5307]] to the ground [[H776]] before him. [[H6440]]

### 15
“What [[H4100]] is this [[H2088]] deed [[H4639]] you have done?” [[H6213]] Joseph [[H3130]] declared. [[H559]] “Did you not [[H3808]] know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] a man [[H376]] like me [[H3644]] can surely divine the truth?” [[H5172]]

### 16
“What [[H4100]] can we say [[H559]] to my lord?” [[H113]] Judah [[H3063]] replied. [[H559]] “How [[H4100]] can we plead? [[H1696]] How [[H4100]] can we justify ourselves? [[H6663]] God [[H430]] has exposed [[H4672]] the iniquity [[H5771]] of your servants. [[H5650]] We are now [[H2005]] my lord’s [[H113]] slaves— [[H5650]] both [[H1571]] we [[H587]] and [[H1571]] the one [[H834]] who was found [[H4672]] with [[H3027]] the cup.” [[H1375]]

### 17
But Joseph replied, [[H559]] “Far be it from me [[H2486]] to do [[H6213]] this. [[H2063]] The man [[H376]] who [[H834]] was found [[H4672]] with [[H3027]] the cup [[H1375]] will be [[H1961]] my slave. [[H5650]] The rest of you [[H859]] may return [[H5927]] to [[H413]] your father [[H1]] in peace.” [[H7965]]

### 18
Then Judah [[H3063]] approached [[H5066]] [Joseph] [[H413]] and said, [[H559]] “Sir, [[H994]] please [[H4994]] let your servant [[H5650]] speak [[H1696]] personally to my lord. [[H113]] Do not [[H408]] be angry [[H2734]] with your servant, [[H5650]] for [[H3588]] you are an equal to [[H3644]] Pharaoh. [[H6547]]

### 19
My lord [[H113]] asked [[H7592]] his servants, [[H5650]] ‘Do you have [[H3426]] a father [[H1]] or [[H176]] a brother?’ [[H251]]

### 20
And we answered, [[H559]] ‘We have [[H3426]] an elderly [[H2205]] father [[H1]] and a younger brother, [[H6996]] the child [[H3206]] of his old age. [[H2208]] The boy’s brother [[H251]] is dead. [[H4191]] He [[H1931]] is the only [[H905]] one of his mother’s [[H517]] sons left, [[H3498]] and his father [[H1]] loves him.’ [[H157]]

### 21
Then you told [[H559]] your servants, [[H5650]] ‘Bring him down [[H3381]] to me [[H413]] so that I can see [[H7760]] him [[H5921]] for myself.’ [[H5869]]

### 22
So we said [[H559]] to [[H413]] my lord, [[H113]] ‘The boy [[H5288]] cannot [[H3808]] leave [[H5800]] his father. [[H1]] If he were to leave, [[H5800]] his father [[H1]] would die.’ [[H4191]]

### 23
But you said [[H559]] to [[H413]] your servants, [[H5650]] ‘Unless [[H3808]] your younger [[H6996]] brother [[H251]] comes down [[H3381]] with you, [[H854]] you will not [[H3808]] see [[H7200]] my face [[H6440]] again.’ [[H3254]]

### 24
Now when [[H1961]] we returned [[H5927]] to [[H413]] your servant [[H5650]] my father, [[H1]] we relayed [[H5046]] your words [[H1697]] to him. [[H853]]

### 25
Then our father [[H1]] said, [[H559]] ‘Go back [[H7725]] and buy [[H7666]] us  some [[H4592]] food.’ [[H400]]

### 26
But we answered, [[H559]] ‘We cannot [[H3808]] go down there [[H3381]] unless [[H518]] our younger [[H6996]] brother [[H251]] goes [[H3381]] with us. [[H854]] So if our younger [[H6996]] brother [[H251]] is not [[H369]] with us, [[H854]] we cannot [[H3808]] see [[H7200]] the man.’ [[H376]]

### 27
And your servant [[H5650]] my father [[H1]] said [[H559]] to us, [[H413]] ‘You [[H859]] know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] my wife [[H802]] bore [[H3205]] me  two sons. [[H8147]]

### 28
When one of them [[H259]] left [[H3318]] me, [[H853]] I said, [[H559]] “Surely [[H389]] he has been torn to pieces.” [[H2963]] And I have not [[H3808]] seen him [[H7200]] since. [[H2008]]

### 29
So if you take [[H3947]] this one [[H2088]] from [[H5973]] me [[H6440]] as well [[H1571]] and harm [[H611]] comes to him, [[H7136]] you will bring my gray hair [[H7872]] down [[H3381]] to Sheol [[H7585]] in sorrow.’ [[H7451]]

### 30
So [[H6258]] if the boy [[H5288]] is not [[H369]] with us [[H854]] when I return [[H935]] to [[H413]] your servant, [[H5650]] my father— [[H1]] his life [[H5315]] is wrapped up [[H7194]] in the boy’s life— [[H5315]]

### 31
when he sees [[H7200]] that [[H3588]] the boy [[H5288]] [is] not [with us], [[H369]] he will die. [[H4191]] Then your servants [[H5650]] will have brought the gray hair [[H7872]] of your servant [[H5650]] our father [[H1]] down [[H3381]] to Sheol [[H7585]] in sorrow. [[H3015]]

### 32
Indeed, [[H3588]] your servant [[H5650]] guaranteed [[H6148]] the boy’s safety [[H5288]] to [[H5973]] my father, [[H1]] saying, [[H559]] ‘If [[H518]] I do not [[H3808]] return [[H935]] him to you, [[H413]] I will [[H3605]] bear the guilt [[H2398]] before you, my father, [[H1]] all my life.’ [[H3117]]

### 33
Now [[H6258]] please [[H4994]] let your servant [[H5650]] stay here [[H3427]] as my lord’s [[H113]] slave, [[H5650]] in place of [[H8478]] the boy. [[H5288]] Let him return [[H5927]] with [[H5973]] his brothers. [[H251]]

### 34
For [[H3588]] how [[H349]] can I go back [[H5927]] to [[H413]] my father [[H1]] without [[H369]] the boy? [[H5288]] I could not bear [[H6435]] to see [[H7200]] the misery [[H7451]] that [[H834]] would overwhelm [[H4672]] [him].” [[H1]]
