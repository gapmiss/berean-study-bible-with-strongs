###### 1
In the beginning [[H7225]] God [[H430]] created [[H1254]] the heavens [[H8064]] and [[H853]] the earth. [[H776]]

###### 2
Now the earth [[H776]] was [[H1961]] formless [[H8414]] and void, [[H922]] and darkness [[H2822]] was over [[H5921]] the surface [[H6440]] of the deep. [[H8415]] And the Spirit [[H7307]] of God [[H430]] was hovering [[H7363]] over [[H5921]] the surface [[H6440]] of the waters. [[H4325]]

###### 3
And God [[H430]] said, [[H559]] “Let there be [[H1961]] light,” [[H216]] and there was [[H1961]] light. [[H216]]

###### 4
And seeing [[H7200]] that [[H3588]] the light [[H216]] [was] good, [[H2896]] God [[H430]] separated [[H914]] the light [[H216]] from [[H996]] the darkness. [[H2822]]

###### 5
God [[H430]] called [[H7121]] the light [[H216]] “day,” [[H3117]] and the darkness [[H2822]] He called [[H7121]] “night.” [[H3915]] And there was [[H1961]] evening, [[H6153]] and there was [[H1961]] morning— [[H1242]] the first [[H259]] day. [[H3117]]

###### 6
And God [[H430]] said, [[H559]] “Let there be [[H1961]] an expanse [[H7549]] between [[H8432]] the waters, [[H4325]] to [[H1961]] separate [[H914]] the waters [[H4325]] from the waters.” [[H4325]]

###### 7
So God [[H430]] made [[H6213]] the expanse [[H7549]] and separated [[H914]] the waters [[H4325]] beneath [[H8478]] [it] [[H7549]] from [[H996]] the waters [[H4325]] above. [[H5921]] And it was [[H1961]] so. [[H3651]]

###### 8
God [[H430]] called [[H7121]] the expanse [[H7549]] “sky.” [[H8064]] And there was [[H1961]] evening, [[H6153]] and [there was] morning— [[H1242]] the second [[H8145]] day. [[H3117]]

###### 9
And God [[H430]] said, [[H559]] “Let the waters [[H4325]] under [[H8478]] the sky [[H8064]] be gathered [[H6960]] into [[H413]] one [[H259]] place, [[H4725]] so that the dry [land] [[H3004]] may appear.” [[H7200]] And it was [[H1961]] so. [[H3651]]

###### 10
God [[H430]] called [[H7121]] the dry [land] [[H3004]] “earth,” [[H776]] and the collection [[H4723]] of waters [[H4325]] He called [[H7121]] “seas.” [[H3220]] And God [[H430]] saw [[H7200]] that [[H3588]] [it was] good. [[H2896]]

###### 11
Then God [[H430]] said, [[H559]] “Let the earth [[H776]] bring forth [[H1876]] vegetation, [[H1877]] seed-bearing [[H2232]] plants [[H6212]] and fruit [[H6529]] trees, [[H6086]] each bearing [[H6213]] fruit [[H6529]] with seed [[H2233]] according to its kind.” [[H4327]] And it was [[H1961]] so. [[H3651]]

###### 12
The earth [[H776]] produced [[H3318]] vegetation, [[H1877]] seed-bearing [[H2232]] plants [[H6212]] according to their kinds [[H4327]] and trees [[H6086]] bearing [[H6213]] fruit [[H6529]] with seed [[H2233]] according to their kinds. [[H4327]] And God [[H430]] saw [[H7200]] that [[H3588]] it was good. [[H2896]]

###### 13
And there was [[H1961]] evening, [[H6153]] and there was [[H1961]] morning— [[H1242]] the third [[H7992]] day. [[H3117]]

###### 14
And God [[H430]] said, [[H559]] “Let there be [[H1961]] lights [[H3974]] in the expanse [[H7549]] of the sky [[H8064]] to distinguish [[H914]] between [[H996]] day [[H3117]] and [[H996]] night [[H3915]] and to mark [[H1961]] [the] seasons [[H4150]] and days [[H3117]] and years, [[H8141]]

###### 15
and let them serve as [[H1961]] lights [[H3974]] in the expanse [[H7549]] of the sky [[H8064]] to shine [[H215]] upon [[H5921]] the earth.” [[H776]] And it was [[H1961]] so. [[H3651]]

###### 16
God [[H430]] made [[H6213]] two [[H8147]] great [[H1419]] lights: [[H3974]] the greater [[H1419]] light [[H3974]] to rule [[H4475]] the day [[H3117]] and [[H853]] the lesser [[H6996]] light [[H3974]] to rule [[H4475]] the night. [[H3915]] And [He made] [[H853]] the stars {as well}. [[H3556]]

###### 17
God [[H430]] set [[H5414]] [these lights] [[H853]] in the expanse [[H7549]] of the sky [[H8064]] to shine [[H215]] upon [[H5921]] the earth, [[H776]]

###### 18
to preside over [[H4910]] the day [[H3117]] and the night, [[H3915]] and to separate [[H914]] the light [[H216]] from [[H996]] the darkness. [[H2822]] And God [[H430]] saw [[H7200]] that [[H3588]] [it was] good. [[H2896]]

###### 19
And there was [[H1961]] evening, [[H6153]] and there was [[H1961]] morning— [[H1242]] the fourth [[H7243]] day. [[H3117]]

###### 20
And God [[H430]] said, [[H559]] “Let the waters [[H4325]] teem [[H8317]] with living [[H5315]] creatures, [[H8318]] and let birds [[H5775]] fly [[H5774]] above [[H5921]] the earth [[H776]] in [[H5921]] the open [[H6440]] expanse [[H7549]] of the sky.” [[H8064]]

###### 21
So [[H853]] God [[H430]] created [[H1254]] the great [[H1419]] sea creatures [[H8577]] and every [[H3605]] living [[H2416]] thing [[H5315]] that moves, [[H7430]] [with] which [[H834]] the waters [[H4325]] teemed [[H8317]] according to their kinds, [[H4327]] and [[H853]] every [[H3605]] bird [[H5775]] of flight [[H3671]] after its kind. [[H4327]] And God [[H430]] saw [[H7200]] that [[H3588]] [it was] good. [[H2896]]

###### 22
Then God [[H430]] blessed [[H1288]] them [[H853]] [and] said, [[H559]] “Be fruitful [[H6509]] and multiply [[H7235]] and fill [[H4390]] the waters [[H4325]] of the seas, [[H3220]] and let birds [[H5775]] multiply [[H7235]] on the earth.” [[H776]]

###### 23
And there was [[H1961]] evening, [[H6153]] and there was [[H1961]] morning— [[H1242]] the fifth [[H2549]] day. [[H3117]]

###### 24
And God [[H430]] said, [[H559]] “Let the earth [[H776]] bring forth [[H3318]] living [[H2416]] creatures [[H5315]] according to their kinds: [[H4327]] livestock, [[H929]] land crawlers, [[H7431]] and wild animals [[H2416]] according to their kinds.” [[H4327]] And it was [[H1961]] so. [[H3651]]

###### 25
God [[H430]] made [[H6213]] the beasts [[H2416]] of the earth [[H776]] according to their kinds, [[H4327]] the livestock [[H929]] according to their kinds, [[H4327]] and [[H853]] everything [[H3605]] that crawls [[H7431]] upon the earth [[H127]] according to its kind. [[H4327]] And God [[H430]] saw [[H7200]] that [[H3588]] [it was] good. [[H2896]]

###### 26
Then God [[H430]] said, [[H559]] “Let Us make [[H6213]] man [[H120]] in Our image, [[H6754]] after Our likeness, [[H1823]] to rule [[H7287]] over the fish [[H1710]] of the sea [[H3220]] and the birds [[H5775]] of the air, [[H8064]] over the livestock, [[H929]] and over all [[H3605]] the earth itself [[H776]] and every [[H3605]] creature [[H7431]] that crawls [[H7430]] upon [[H5921]] [it]. [[H776]]

###### 27
So God [[H430]] created [[H1254]] man [[H120]] in His [own] image; [[H6754]] in the image [[H6754]] of God [[H430]] He created [[H1254]] him; [[H853]] male [[H2145]] and female [[H5347]] He created [[H1254]] them. [[H853]]

###### 28
God [[H430]] blessed [[H1288]] them [[H853]] and [[H430]] said [[H559]] to them,  “Be fruitful [[H6509]] and multiply, [[H7235]] and fill [[H4390]] the earth [[H776]] and subdue it; [[H3533]] rule [[H7287]] over the fish [[H1710]] of the sea [[H3220]] and the birds [[H5775]] of the air [[H8064]] and every [[H3605]] creature [[H2416]] that crawls [[H7430]] upon [[H5921]] the earth. [[H776]]

###### 29
Then God [[H430]] said, [[H559]] “Behold, [[H2009]] I have given [[H5414]] you  every [[H3605]] seed-bearing [[H2233]] plant [[H6212]] on [[H5921]] the face [[H6440]] of all [[H3605]] the earth, [[H776]] and [[H853]] every [[H3605]] tree [[H6086]] whose [[H834]] fruit [[H6529]] contains [[H2232]] seed. [[H2233]] They will be [[H1961]] yours  for food. [[H402]]

###### 30
And to every [[H3605]] beast [[H2416]] of the earth [[H776]] and every [[H3605]] bird [[H5775]] of the air [[H8064]] and every [[H3605]] creature that crawls [[H7430]] upon [[H5921]] the earth— [[H776]] everything that has [[H834]] the breath [[H5315]] of life [[H2416]] in it— [[H853]] [I have given] every [[H3605]] green [[H3418]] plant [[H6212]] for food.” [[H402]] And it was [[H1961]] so. [[H3651]]

###### 31
And God [[H430]] looked upon [[H7200]] all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] He had made, [[H6213]] and indeed, [[H2009]] [it was] very [[H3966]] good. [[H2896]] And there was [[H1961]] evening, [[H6153]] and there was [[H1961]] morning— [[H1242]] the sixth [[H8345]] day. [[H3117]]
