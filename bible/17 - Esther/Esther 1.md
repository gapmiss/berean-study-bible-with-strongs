###### 1
This is what happened [[H1961]] in the days [[H3117]] of Xerxes, [[H325]] who reigned over [[H4427]] 127 [[H7651]] provinces [[H4082]] from India [[H1912]] to [[H5704]] Cush. [[H3568]]

###### 2
In those [[H1992]] days [[H3117]] King [[H4428]] Xerxes [[H325]] sat [[H7675]] on [[H5921]] his royal [[H4438]] throne [[H3678]] in the citadel [[H1002]] of Susa. [[H7800]]

###### 3
In the third [[H7969]] year [[H8141]] of his reign, [[H4427]] [Xerxes] held [[H6213]] a feast [[H4960]] for all [[H3605]] his officials [[H8269]] and servants. [[H5650]] The military leaders [[H2426]] of Persia [[H6539]] and Media [[H4074]] [were there], [[H6440]] along with the nobles [[H6579]] and princes [[H8269]] of the provinces. [[H4082]]

###### 4
And for a full [[H7227]] 180 [[H8084]] days, [[H3117]] he displayed [[H7200]] the glorious [[H3519]] riches [[H6239]] of his kingdom [[H4438]] and [[H853]] the magnificent [[H8597]] splendor [[H3366]] of his greatness. [[H1420]]

###### 5
At the end [[H4390]] of this [[H428]] time, [[H3117]] in the garden [[H1594]] courtyard [[H2691]] of the royal [[H4428]] palace, [[H1055]] the king [[H4428]] held [[H6213]] a seven-day [[H7651]] feast [[H4960]] for all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] in the citadel [[H1002]] of Susa, [[H7800]] from the least [[H6996]] to [[H5704]] the greatest. [[H1419]]

###### 6
[Hangings of] white [[H2353]] and violet [[H8504]] linen [[H3768]] were fastened [[H270]] with cords [[H2256]] of fine white [[H948]] and purple [[H713]] to [[H5921]] silver [[H3701]] rings [[H1550]] on the marble [[H8336]] pillars. [[H5982]] Gold [[H2091]] and silver [[H3701]] couches [[H4296]] were arranged [[H5921]] on a mosaic pavement [[H7531]] of porphyry, [[H923]] marble, [[H8336]] mother-of-pearl, [[H1858]] and other precious stones. [[H5508]]

###### 7
Beverages were served [[H8248]] in an array of goblets [[H3627]] of gold, [[H2091]] each [[H3627]] with a different design, [[H8138]] and the royal [[H4438]] wine [[H3196]] flowed freely, [[H7227]] according to the king’s [[H4428]] bounty. [[H3027]]

###### 8
By [[H1881]] order [[H3245]] of the king, [[H4428]] no [[H369]] limit [[H597]] was placed on the drinking, [[H8360]] and every [[H3605]] wine steward [[H7227]] was to serve [[H6213]] each [[H376]] man [[H376]] whatever he desired. [[H7522]]

###### 9
Queen [[H4436]] Vashti [[H2060]] also [[H1571]] gave [[H6213]] a banquet [[H4960]] for the women [[H802]] in the royal [[H4438]] palace [[H1004]] of King [[H4428]] Xerxes. [[H325]]

###### 10
On the seventh [[H7637]] day, [[H3117]] when the king's [[H4428]] heart [[H3820]] was merry [[H2896]] with wine, [[H3196]] he ordered [[H559]] the seven [[H7651]] eunuchs [[H5631]] who served [[H8334]] him— [[H325]] Mehuman, [[H4104]] Biztha, [[H968]] Harbona, [[H2726]] Bigtha, [[H903]] Abagtha, [[H5]] Zethar, [[H2242]] and Carkas— [[H3752]]

###### 11
to bring [[H935]] Queen [[H4436]] Vashti [[H2060]] before [[H6440]] him, [[H4428]] [wearing] her royal [[H4438]] crown, [[H3804]] to display [[H7200]] her beauty [[H3308]] to the people [[H5971]] and officials. [[H8269]] For [[H3588]] she [was] [[H1931]] beautiful [[H2896]] to behold. [[H4758]]

###### 12
Queen [[H4436]] Vashti, however, [[H2060]] refused [[H3985]] to come [[H935]] at the king’s [[H4428]] command [[H1697]] [brought] by [[H3027]] [his] eunuchs. [[H5631]] And the king [[H4428]] became furious, [[H7107]] and his anger [[H2534]] burned [[H1197]] within him. 

###### 13
Then the king [[H4428]] consulted [[H559]] the wise men [[H2450]] who knew [[H3045]] the times, [[H6256]] for it was [[H3588]] customary [[H3651]] for him [[H4428]] to confer [[H1697]] with [[H6440]] the experts [[H3045]] in law [[H1881]] and justice. [[H1779]]

###### 14
His closest advisors [were] [[H7138]] Carshena, [[H3771]] Shethar, [[H8369]] Admatha, [[H133]] Tarshish, [[H8659]] Meres, [[H4825]] Marsena, [[H4826]] and Memucan, [[H4462]] the seven [[H7651]] princes [[H8269]] of Persia [[H6539]] and Media [[H4074]] who had personal access to [[H7200]] the king [[H4428]] [and] ranked [[H3427]] highest [[H7223]] in the kingdom. [[H4438]]

###### 15
“According to law,” [[H1881]] he asked, “what [[H4100]] should be done [[H6213]] with Queen [[H4436]] Vashti, [[H2060]] since [[H5921]] she refused to obey [[H3808]] the command [[H3982]] of King [[H4428]] Xerxes [[H325]] delivered by [[H3027]] the eunuchs?” [[H5631]]

###### 16
And in the presence [[H6440]] of the king [[H4428]] and his princes, [[H8269]] Memucan [[H4462]] replied, [[H559]] “Queen [[H4436]] Vashti [[H2060]] has wronged [[H5753]] not [[H3808]] only [[H905]] the king, [[H4428]] but [[H3588]] all [[H3605]] the princes [[H8269]] and the peoples [[H5971]] in all [[H3605]] the provinces [[H4082]] of King [[H4428]] Xerxes. [[H325]]

###### 17
For [[H3588]] the conduct [[H1697]] of the queen [[H4436]] will become known [[H3318]] to [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] women, [[H802]] causing them to despise [[H959]] their husbands [[H1167]] and say, [[H559]] ‘King [[H4428]] Xerxes [[H325]] ordered [[H559]] Queen [[H4436]] Vashti [[H2060]] to be brought [[H935]] before him, [[H6440]] but she did not [[H3808]] come.’ [[H935]]

###### 18
This [[H2088]] very day [[H3117]] the noble women [[H8282]] of Persia [[H6539]] and Media [[H4074]] who [[H834]] have heard [[H8085]] about [[H853]] the queen's [[H4436]] conduct [[H1697]] will say [[H559]] the same thing to all [[H3605]] the king’s [[H4428]] officials, [[H8269]] resulting in much [[H1767]] contempt [[H963]] and wrath. [[H7110]]

###### 19
So if [[H518]] it pleases [[H2895]] the king, [[H4428]] let him issue [[H3318]] a royal [[H4438]] decree, [[H1697]] and let it be recorded [[H3789]] in the laws [[H1881]] of Persia [[H6539]] and Media [[H4074]] so that it cannot [[H3808]] be repealed, [[H5674]] that [[H834]] Vashti [[H2060]] shall never again [[H3808]] enter [[H935]] the presence [[H6440]] of King [[H4428]] Xerxes, [[H325]] and her royal position [[H4438]] shall be given [[H5414]] to a woman [[H7468]] more worthy [[H2896]] than she. [[H4480]]

###### 20
The edict [[H6599]] the king [[H4428]] issues [[H6213]] will be heard [[H8085]] throughout [[H3605]] his vast [[H7227]] kingdom— [[H4438]] and so [[H3588]] all [[H3605]] women, [[H802]] from the least [[H6996]] to [[H5704]] the greatest, [[H1419]] will honor [[H5414]] their husbands.” [[H1167]]

###### 21
The king [[H4428]] and his princes [[H8269]] were pleased [[H3190]] with this counsel; [[H1697]] so the king [[H4428]] did [[H6213]] as Memucan [[H4462]] had advised. [[H1697]]

###### 22
He sent [[H7971]] letters [[H5612]] to [[H413]] all [[H3605]] the provinces [[H4082]] of the kingdom, [[H4428]] to [[H413]] each province [[H4082]] in its own script [[H3791]] and to [[H413]] each people [[H5971]] in their own language, [[H3956]] proclaiming [[H1696]] that every [[H3605]] man [[H376]] should be [[H1961]] master [[H8323]] of his own household.
