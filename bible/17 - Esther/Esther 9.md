### 1
On the thirteenth [[H7969]] day [[H3117]] of the twelfth [[H8147]] month, [[H2320]] the month [[H2320]] of Adar, [[H143]] the king's [[H4428]] command [[H1697]] and edict [[H1881]] were to be executed. [[H6213]] On this day [[H3117]] the enemies [[H341]] of the Jews [[H3064]] had hoped [[H7663]] to overpower [[H7980]] them,  but the tables were turned [[H2015]] and the Jews [[H3064]] overpowered [[H7980]] those [[H1992]] who hated them. [[H8130]]

### 2
In each [[H3605]] of the provinces [[H4082]] of King [[H4428]] Xerxes, [[H325]] the Jews [[H3064]] assembled [[H6950]] in their cities [[H5892]] to attack [[H7971]] those who sought [[H1245]] to harm them. [[H7451]] No [[H3808]] man [[H376]] could withstand [[H5975]] them, [[H6440]] because [[H3588]] the fear of them [[H6343]] had fallen [[H5307]] upon [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] peoples. [[H5971]]

### 3
And all [[H3605]] the officials [[H8269]] of the provinces, [[H4082]] the satraps, [[H323]] the governors, [[H6346]] and the king's [[H4428]] administrators [[H6213]] helped [[H5375]] the Jews, [[H3064]] because [[H3588]] the fear [[H6343]] of Mordecai [[H4782]] had fallen [[H5307]] upon them. [[H5921]]

### 4
For [[H3588]] Mordecai [[H4782]] exercised great [[H1419]] power in the palace, [[H1004]] and his fame [[H8089]] spread [[H1980]] throughout [[H3605]] the provinces [[H4082]] as [[H3588]] he [[H4782]] became [[H1980]] more and more powerful. [[H1419]]

### 5
The Jews [[H3064]] put [[H5221]] all [[H3605]] their enemies [[H341]] to the sword, [[H2719]] killing [[H2027]] and destroying them, [[H12]] and they did [[H6213]] what they pleased [[H7522]] to those who hated them. [[H8130]]

### 6
In the citadel [[H1002]] of Susa, [[H7800]] the Jews [[H3064]] killed [[H2026]] and destroyed [[H6]] five [[H2568]] hundred [[H3967]] men, [[H376]]

### 7
including Parshandatha, [[H6577]] Dalphon, [[H1813]] Aspatha, [[H630]]

### 8
Poratha, [[H6334]] Adalia, [[H118]] Aridatha, [[H743]]

### 9
Parmashta, [[H6534]] Arisai, [[H747]] Aridai, [[H742]] and Vaizatha. [[H2055]]

### 10
They killed [[H2026]] these ten [[H6235]] sons [[H1121]] of Haman [[H2001]] son [[H1121]] of Hammedatha, [[H4099]] the enemy [[H6887]] of the Jews, [[H3064]] but they did not [[H3808]] lay [[H7971]] a hand [[H3027]] on the plunder. [[H961]]

### 11
On that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] the number [[H4557]] of those killed [[H2026]] in the citadel [[H1002]] of Susa [[H7800]] was reported to [[H6440]] the king, [[H4428]]

### 12
who [[H4428]] said [[H559]] to Queen [[H4436]] Esther, [[H635]] “In the citadel [[H1002]] of Susa [[H7800]] the Jews [[H3064]] have killed [[H2026]] and destroyed [[H6]] five [[H2568]] hundred [[H3967]] men, [[H376]] including Haman’s [[H2001]] ten [[H6235]] sons. [[H1121]] What [[H4100]] have they done [[H6213]] in the rest [[H7605]] of the royal [[H4428]] provinces? [[H4082]] Now what [is] [[H4100]] your petition? [[H7596]] It will be given [[H5414]] to you.  And what [[H4100]] further [[H5750]] do you request? [[H1246]] It will be fulfilled. [[H6213]]

### 13
Esther [[H635]] replied, [[H559]] “If [[H518]] it pleases [[H5921]] the king, [[H4428]] may the Jews [[H3064]] in Susa [[H7800]] also [[H1571]] have tomorrow [[H4279]] to carry out [[H6213]] today’s [[H3117]] edict, [[H1881]] and may the bodies of Haman’s [[H2001]] ten [[H6235]] sons [[H1121]] be hanged [[H8518]] on [[H5921]] the gallows.” [[H6086]]

### 14
So the king [[H4428]] commanded [[H559]] that this [[H3651]] be done. [[H6213]] An edict [[H1881]] was issued [[H5414]] in Susa, [[H7800]] and they hanged [[H8518]] the ten [[H6235]] sons [[H1121]] of Haman. [[H2001]]

### 15
On the fourteenth [[H702]] day [[H3117]] of the month [[H2320]] of Adar, [[H143]] the Jews [[H3064]] in Susa [[H7800]] came together [[H6950]] again [[H1571]] and put to death [[H2026]] three [[H7969]] hundred [[H3967]] men [[H376]] [there], [[H7800]] but they did not [[H3808]] lay [[H7971]] a hand [[H3027]] on the plunder. [[H961]]

### 16
The rest [[H7605]] of the Jews [[H3064]] in the royal [[H4428]] provinces [[H4082]] also assembled [[H6950]] to defend [[H5975]] themselves [[H5315]] and rid themselves [[H5118]] of their enemies. [[H341]] They killed [[H2026]] 75,000 [[H2568]] who hated them, [[H8130]] but did not [[H3808]] lay [[H7971]] a hand [[H3027]] on the plunder. [[H961]]

### 17
This was done on the thirteenth [[H7969]] day [[H3117]] of the month [[H2320]] of Adar, [[H143]] and on the fourteenth day [[H702]] they rested, [[H5117]] making it [[H6213]] a day [[H3117]] of feasting [[H4960]] and joy. [[H8057]]

### 18
The Jews [[H3064]] in Susa, however, [[H7800]] had assembled [[H6950]] on the thirteenth [[H7969]] and the fourteenth [[H702]] days of the month. [[H6240]] So they rested [[H5117]] on the fifteenth [[H2568]] day, [[H6240]] making [[H6213]] it [[H853]] a day [[H3117]] of feasting [[H4960]] and joy. [[H8057]]

### 19
This is why [[H5921]] the rural [[H6521]] Jews, [[H3064]] who live [[H3427]] in the villages, [[H5892]] observe [[H6213]] the fourteenth day [[H702]] of the month [[H2320]] of Adar [[H143]] as a day [[H3117]] of joy [[H8057]] and feasting. [[H4960]] It is a holiday [[H3117]] for sending [[H4916]] gifts [[H4490]] to one [[H376]] another. [[H7453]]

### 20
Mordecai [[H4782]] recorded [[H3789]] these [[H428]] events [[H1697]] and sent [[H7971]] letters [[H5612]] to [[H413]] all [[H3605]] the Jews [[H3064]] in all [[H3605]] the provinces [[H4082]] of King [[H4428]] Xerxes, [[H325]] both near [[H7138]] and far, [[H7350]]

### 21
to establish [[H6965]] among them [[H5921]] an annual [[H3605]] celebration [[H6213]] on the fourteenth [[H702]] and fifteenth [[H2568]] days [[H3117]] of the month [[H2320]] of Adar [[H143]]

### 22
as the days [[H3117]] on which [[H834]] the Jews [[H3064]] had rid themselves [[H5117]] of their enemies [[H341]] and the month [[H2320]] in which [[H834]] their sorrow [[H3015]] had turned [[H2015]] to joy [[H8057]] and their mourning [[H60]] into a holiday. [[H3117]] [He wrote] that these were to be [[H6213]] days [[H3117]] of feasting [[H4960]] and joy, [[H8057]] of sending [[H4916]] gifts [[H4490]] to one [[H376]] another [[H7453]] [and] [[H4979]] to the poor. [[H34]]

### 23
So the Jews [[H3064]] agreed to continue [[H6901]] the custom [[H6213]] they had started, [[H2490]] as [[H834]] Mordecai [[H4782]] had written [[H3789]] to them. [[H413]]

### 24
For [[H3588]] Haman [[H2001]] son [[H1121]] of Hammedatha [[H4099]] the Agagite, [[H91]] the enemy [[H6887]] of all [[H3605]] the Jews, [[H3064]] had plotted [[H2803]] against [[H5921]] the Jews [[H3064]] to destroy them [[H6]] and had cast [[H5307]] the Pur [[H6332]] (that is, [[H1931]] the lot) [[H1486]] to crush [[H2000]] and destroy them. [[H6]]

### 25
But when it came [[H935]] before [[H6440]] the king, [[H4428]] he commanded [[H559]] by [[H5973]] letter [[H5612]] that the wicked [[H7451]] scheme [[H4284]] which [[H834]] Haman had devised [[H2803]] against [[H5921]] the Jews [[H3064]] should come back [[H7725]] on [[H5921]] his own head, [[H7218]] and that he [[H853]] and [[H853]] his sons [[H1121]] should be hanged [[H8518]] on [[H5921]] the gallows. [[H6086]]

### 26
Therefore [[H5921]] these [[H428]] days [[H3117]] are called [[H7121]] Purim, [[H6332]] from [[H5921]] the word [[H8034]] Pur. [[H6332]] Because of [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] the instructions [[H1697]] in this [[H2063]] letter, [[H107]] and because of all [[H4100]] they had seen [[H7200]] and experienced, [[H4100]]

### 27
the Jews [[H3064]] bound themselves [[H6901]] to establish the custom [[H6965]] that they [[H5921]] and their descendants [[H2233]] and all [[H3605]] who join [[H3867]] them [[H5921]] should not [[H3808]] fail [[H5674]] to celebrate [[H6213]] these [[H428]] two [[H8147]] days [[H3117]] at the [appointed] time [[H2165]] each [[H3605]] and every year, [[H8141]] according to their regulation. [[H3791]]

### 28
These [[H428]] days [[H3117]] [should be] remembered [[H2142]] and celebrated [[H6213]] by every [[H3605]] generation, [[H1755]] family, [[H4940]] province, [[H4082]] and city, [[H5892]] so that these [[H428]] days [[H3117]] of Purim [[H6332]] should not [[H3808]] fail [to be observed] [[H5674]] among [[H8432]] the Jews, [[H3064]] nor should the memory of them [[H2143]] fade [[H5486]] from their descendants. [[H2233]]

### 29
So Queen [[H4436]] Esther [[H635]] daughter [[H1323]] of Abihail, [[H32]] along with Mordecai [[H4782]] the Jew, [[H3064]] wrote [[H3789]] with full [[H3605]] authority [[H8633]] to confirm [[H6965]] this [[H2063]] second [[H8145]] letter [[H107]] concerning Purim. [[H6332]]

### 30
And [Mordecai] sent [[H7971]] letters [[H5612]] [with] words [[H1697]] of peace [[H7965]] and truth [[H571]] to [[H413]] all [[H3605]] the Jews [[H3064]] in [[H413]] the 127 [[H7651]] provinces [[H4082]] of the kingdom [[H4438]] of Xerxes, [[H325]]

### 31
in order to confirm [[H6965]] these [[H428]] days [[H3117]] of Purim [[H6332]] at their [appointed] time, [[H2165]] just as [[H834]] Mordecai [[H4782]] the Jew [[H3064]] and Queen [[H4436]] Esther [[H635]] had established them [[H6965]] [and] [[H834]] had committed [[H6965]] themselves [[H5315]] and their descendants [[H2233]] to the times [[H1697]] of fasting [[H6685]] and lamentation. [[H2201]]

### 32
So Esther’s [[H635]] decree [[H3982]] confirmed [[H6965]] these [[H428]] regulations [[H1697]] about Purim, [[H6332]] which were written [[H3789]] into the record. [[H5612]]
