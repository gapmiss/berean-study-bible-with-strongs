### 1
After [[H310]] these [[H428]] events, [[H1697]] King [[H4428]] Xerxes [[H325]] honored [[H1431]] Haman [[H2001]] son [[H1121]] of Hammedatha, [[H4099]] the Agagite, [[H91]] elevating him [[H5375]] to a position [[H3678]] above [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] the princes [[H8269]] who [[H834]] [were] with him. [[H854]]

### 2
All [[H3605]] the royal [[H4428]] servants [[H5650]] at the King’s [[H4428]] Gate [[H8179]] bowed down [[H3766]] and paid homage [[H7812]] to Haman, [[H2001]] because [[H3588]] the king [[H4428]] had commanded [[H6680]] this [[H3651]] for him.  But Mordecai [[H4782]] would not [[H3808]] bow down [[H3766]] or pay homage. [[H7812]]

### 3
Then the royal [[H4428]] servants [[H5650]] at the King’s [[H4428]] Gate [[H8179]] asked [[H559]] Mordecai, [[H4782]] “Why [[H4069]] do you [[H859]] disobey [[H5674]] the command [[H4687]] of the king?” [[H4428]]

### 4
Day [[H3117]] after day [[H3117]] they warned him, [[H559]] but he would not [[H3808]] comply. [[H8085]] So they reported it [[H5046]] to Haman [[H2001]] to see [[H7200]] whether Mordecai's [[H4782]] behavior [[H1697]] would be tolerated, [[H5975]] since [[H3588]] he had told [[H5046]] them he [[H1931]] was a Jew. [[H3064]]

### 5
When Haman [[H2001]] saw [[H7200]] that [[H3588]] Mordecai [[H4782]] would not [[H369]] bow down [[H3766]] or pay him homage, [[H7812]] he [[H2001]] was filled [[H4390]] with rage. [[H2534]]

### 6
And when [[H3588]] he learned the identity [[H5046]] of Mordecai’s [[H4782]] people, [[H5971]] he despised the notion [[H959]] of laying [[H7971]] hands [[H3027]] on Mordecai [[H4782]] alone. [[H905]] Instead, he [[H2001]] sought [[H1245]] to destroy [[H8045]] all [[H3605]] of Mordecai’s [[H4782]] people, [[H5971]] the Jews, [[H3064]] throughout [[H3605]] the kingdom [[H4438]] of Xerxes. [[H325]]

### 7
In the twelfth [[H8147]] year [[H8141]] of King [[H4428]] Xerxes, [[H325]] in the first [[H7223]] month, [[H2320]] the month [[H2320]] of Nisan, [[H5212]] the pur [[H6332]] (that is, [[H1931]] the lot) [[H1486]] was cast [[H5307]] before [[H6440]] Haman [[H2001]] to determine a day [[H3117]] and month. [[H2320]] And the lot fell on the twelfth [[H8147]] month, [[H2320]] the month of Adar. [[H143]]

### 8
Then Haman [[H2001]] informed [[H559]] King [[H4428]] Xerxes, [[H325]] “There [[H3426]] is a certain [[H259]] people [[H5971]] scattered [[H6340]] and dispersed [[H6504]] among [[H996]] the peoples [[H5971]] of every [[H3605]] province [[H4082]] of your kingdom. [[H4438]] Their laws [[H1881]] are different [[H8138]] from everyone [[H3605]] else’s, [[H5971]] and they do not [[H369]] obey [[H6213]] the king’s [[H4428]] laws; [[H1881]] it is not [[H369]] in the king’s [[H4428]] best interest [[H7737]] to tolerate them. [[H3240]]

### 9
If [[H518]] the king [[H4428]] approves, [[H5921]] let [a decree] be issued [[H3789]] to destroy them, [[H6]] and I will deposit [[H935]] ten [[H6235]] thousand [[H505]] talents [[H3603]] of silver [[H3701]] into [[H413]] the royal [[H4428]] treasury [[H1595]] to pay [[H8254]] those who carry this out.” [[H6213]]

### 10
So the king [[H4428]] removed [[H5493]] the signet ring [[H2885]] from [[H5921]] his finger [[H3027]] and gave [[H5414]] it to Haman [[H2001]] son [[H1121]] of Hammedatha, [[H4099]] the Agagite, [[H91]] the enemy [[H6887]] of the Jews. [[H3064]]

### 11
“Keep your money,” [[H3701]] said [[H559]] the king [[H4428]] to Haman. [[H2001]] “These people [[H5971]] [are] given [[H5414]] to you  to do [[H6213]] with them  as you please.” [[H5869]]

### 12
On the thirteenth [[H7969]] day [[H3117]] of the first [[H7223]] month, [[H2320]] the royal [[H4428]] scribes [[H5608]] were summoned [[H7121]] and the order was written [[H3789]] exactly as [[H3605]] Haman [[H2001]] commanded [[H6680]] the royal [[H4428]] satraps, [[H323]] the governors [[H6346]] of each province, [[H4082]] and the officials [[H8269]] of each [[H5971]] people, [[H5971]] in the script [[H3791]] of each province [[H4082]] and the language [[H3956]] of every people. [[H5971]] It was written [[H3789]] in the name [[H8034]] of King [[H4428]] Xerxes [[H325]] and sealed [[H2856]] with the royal [[H4428]] signet ring. [[H2885]]

### 13
And the letters [[H5612]] were sent [[H7971]] by [[H3027]] couriers [[H7323]] to [[H413]] each [[H3605]] of the royal [[H4428]] provinces [[H4082]] with the order to destroy, [[H8045]] kill, [[H2026]] and annihilate [[H6]] all [[H3605]] the Jews— [[H3064]] young [[H5288]] and [[H5704]] old, [[H2205]] women [[H802]] and children— [[H2945]] and to plunder [[H962]] their possessions [[H7998]] on a single [[H259]] day, [[H3117]] the thirteenth [[H7969]] day of Adar, [[H143]] the twelfth [[H8147]] month. [[H2320]]

### 14
A copy [[H6572]] of the text [[H3791]] of the edict [[H1881]] was to be issued [[H5414]] in every [[H3605]] province [[H4082]] and published [[H1540]] to all [[H3605]] the people, [[H5971]] so that they would be ready [[H6264]] for that [[H2088]] day. [[H3117]]

### 15
The couriers [[H7323]] left, [[H3318]] spurred on [[H1765]] by the king's [[H4428]] command, [[H1697]] and the law [[H1881]] was issued [[H5414]] in the citadel [[H1002]] of Susa. [[H7800]] Then the king [[H4428]] and Haman [[H2001]] sat down [[H3427]] to drink, [[H8354]] but the city [[H5892]] of Susa [[H7800]] was in confusion. [[H943]]
