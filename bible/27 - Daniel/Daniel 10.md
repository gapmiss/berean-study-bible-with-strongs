### 1
In the third [[H7969]] year [[H8141]] of Cyrus [[H3566]] king [[H4428]] of Persia, [[H6539]] a message [[H1697]] was revealed [[H1540]] to Daniel, [[H1840]] who [[H834]] was called [[H7121]] Belteshazzar. [[H1095]] The message [[H1697]] was true, [[H571]] and it concerned a great [[H1419]] conflict. [[H6635]] And the understanding [[H998]] of the message [[H1697]] was given to him [[H995]] in a vision. [[H4758]]

### 2
In those [[H1992]] days [[H3117]] I, [[H589]] Daniel, [[H1840]] was [[H1961]] mourning [[H56]] for three [[H7969]] full [[H3117]] weeks. [[H7620]]

### 3
I ate [[H398]] no [[H3808]] rich [[H2530]] food, [[H3899]] no [[H3808]] meat [[H1320]] or wine [[H3196]] entered [[H935]] my mouth, [[H6310]] and I did not [[H3808]] anoint myself with oil [[H5480]] until [[H5704]] the three [[H7969]] weeks [[H7620]] were completed. [[H4390]]

### 4
On the twenty-fourth [[H6242]] day [[H3117]] of the first [[H7223]] month, [[H2320]] as I [[H589]] was [[H1961]] standing on [[H5921]] the bank [[H3027]] of the great [[H1419]] river, [[H5104]] the Tigris, [[H2313]]

### 5
I lifted up [[H5375]] my eyes, [[H5869]] and behold, [[H2009]] there was a certain [[H259]] man [[H376]] dressed [[H3847]] in linen, [[H906]] with a belt [[H2296]] of fine gold [[H3800]] from Uphaz [[H210]] around his waist. [[H4975]]

### 6
His body [was] [[H1472]] like beryl, [[H8658]] his face [[H6440]] like the brilliance [[H4758]] of lightning, [[H1300]] his eyes [[H5869]] like flaming [[H784]] torches, [[H3940]] his arms [[H2220]] and legs [[H4772]] like the gleam [[H5869]] of polished [[H7044]] bronze, [[H5178]] and the sound [[H6963]] of his words [[H1697]] like the sound [[H6963]] of a multitude. [[H1995]]

### 7
Only [[H905]] I, [[H589]] Daniel, [[H1840]] saw [[H7200]] the vision; [[H4759]] the men [[H582]] with me [[H5973]] did not [[H3808]] see it, [[H7200]] but [[H61]] a great [[H1419]] terror [[H2731]] fell [[H5307]] upon them, [[H5921]] and they ran [[H1272]] and hid themselves. [[H2244]]

### 8
So I [[H589]] was left alone, [[H7604]] gazing at [[H7200]] this [[H2063]] great [[H1419]] vision. [[H4759]] No [[H3808]] strength [[H3581]] remained [[H7604]] in me;  my face [[H1935]] grew [[H2015]] deathly pale, [[H4889]] and I was powerless. [[H3808]]

### 9
I heard [[H8085]] the sound [[H6963]] of his words, [[H1697]] and as I listened, [[H8085]] I [[H589]] fell into a deep sleep, [[H7290]] with my face [[H6440]] to the ground. [[H776]]

### 10
Suddenly, [[H2009]] a hand [[H3027]] touched [[H5060]] me  and set me trembling [[H5128]] on [[H5921]] my hands [[H3709]] and knees. [[H1290]]

### 11
He said [[H559]] to me, [[H413]] “Daniel, [[H1840]] you are a man [[H376]] who is highly precious. [[H2530]] Consider carefully [[H995]] the words [[H1697]] that [[H834]] I am [[H595]] about to say [[H1696]] to you. [[H413]] Stand [[H5975]] up, [[H5921]] for [[H3588]] I have now [[H6258]] been sent [[H7971]] to you.” [[H413]] And when he had said [[H1696]] this [[H2088]] to me, [[H5973]] I stood up [[H5975]] trembling. [[H7460]]

### 12
“Do not [[H408]] be afraid, [[H3372]] Daniel,” [[H1840]] he said, [[H559]] “for [[H3588]] from [[H4480]] the first [[H7223]] day [[H3117]] that [[H834]] you purposed [[H5414]] to understand [[H995]] and to humble [[H6031]] yourself before [[H6440]] your God, [[H430]] your words [[H1697]] were heard, [[H8085]] and I [[H589]] have come [[H935]] in response to them. [[H1697]]

### 13
However, the prince [[H8269]] of the kingdom [[H4438]] of Persia [[H6539]] opposed [[H5975]] me [[H5048]] for twenty-one [[H6242]] days. [[H3117]] Then Michael, [[H4317]] one [[H259]] of the chief [[H7223]] princes, [[H8269]] came [[H935]] to help me, [[H5826]] for I [[H589]] had been left [[H3498]] there [[H8033]] with [[H681]] the kings [[H4428]] of Persia. [[H6539]]

### 14
Now I have come [[H935]] to explain to you [[H995]] what [[H834]] will happen [[H7136]] to your people [[H5971]] in the latter [[H319]] days, [[H3117]] for [[H3588]] the vision [[H2377]] concerns those days.” [[H3117]]

### 15
While he was speaking [[H1696]] these [[H428]] words [[H1697]] to me, [[H5973]] I set [[H5414]] my face [[H6440]] toward the ground [[H776]] and became speechless. [[H481]]

### 16
And suddenly [[H2009]] [one] with the likeness [[H1823]] of a man [[H120]] touched [[H5060]] my lips, [[H8193]] and I opened [[H6605]] my mouth [[H6310]] and said [[H559]] to [[H413]] the one standing [[H5975]] before me, [[H5048]] “My lord, [[H113]] because of the vision, [[H4759]] I am overcome [[H2015]] with anguish, [[H6735]] and I have [[H6113]] no [[H3808]] strength. [[H3581]]

### 17
How [[H1963]] can I, [[H3201]] [your] [[H113]] servant, [[H5650]] speak [[H1696]] with [[H5973]] [you], [[H2088]] my lord? [[H113]] Now [[H6258]] I [[H589]] have [[H5975]] no [[H3808]] strength, [[H3581]] nor [[H3808]] is any breath [[H5397]] left [[H7604]] in me.” 

### 18
Again [[H3254]] [the one] with the likeness [[H4758]] of a man [[H120]] touched [[H5060]] me  and strengthened me. [[H2388]]

### 19
“Do not [[H408]] be afraid, [[H3372]] you who are highly precious,” [[H2530]] he said. [[H559]] “Peace [be] [[H7965]] with you!  Be strong now, [[H2388]] be very strong!” [[H2388]] As he spoke [[H1696]] to me, [[H5973]] I was strengthened [[H2388]] and said, [[H559]] “May my lord [[H113]] speak, [[H1696]] for [[H3588]] you have strengthened me.” [[H2388]]

### 20
“Do you know [[H3045]] why [[H4100]] I have come [[H935]] to you?” [[H413]] he said. [[H559]] “I must return [[H7725]] at once [[H6258]] to fight [[H3898]] against [[H5973]] the prince [[H8269]] of Persia, [[H6539]] and when I [[H589]] have gone forth, [[H3318]] behold, [[H2009]] the prince [[H8269]] of Greece [[H3120]] will come. [[H935]]

### 21
But first [[H61]] I will tell [[H5046]] you  what is inscribed [[H7559]] in the book [[H3791]] of truth. [[H571]] Yet no [[H369]] one [[H259]] has the courage [[H2388]] to support me [[H5973]] against [[H5921]] these, [[H428]] except [[H3588]] Michael, [[H4317]] your prince. [[H8269]]
