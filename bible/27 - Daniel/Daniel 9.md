###### 1
In the first [[H259]] year [[H8141]] of Darius [[H1867]] son [[H1121]] of Xerxes, [[H325]] a Mede [[H4074]] by descent, [[H2233]] who [[H834]] was made ruler [[H4427]] over [[H5921]] the kingdom [[H4438]] of the Chaldeans— [[H3778]]

###### 2
in the first [[H259]] year [[H8141]] of his reign, [[H4427]] I, [[H589]] Daniel, [[H1840]] understood [[H995]] from the sacred books, [[H5612]] according to the word [[H1697]] of the LORD [[H3068]] to [[H413]] Jeremiah [[H3414]] the prophet, [[H5030]] that the desolation [[H2723]] of Jerusalem [[H3389]] would last [[H4390]] seventy [[H7657]] years. [[H8141]]

###### 3
So I turned my attention [[H5414]] to [[H413]] the Lord [[H136]] God [[H430]] to seek [[H1245]] Him by prayer [[H8605]] and petition, [[H8469]] with fasting, [[H6685]] sackcloth, [[H8242]] and ashes. [[H665]]

###### 4
And I prayed [[H6419]] to the LORD [[H3068]] my God [[H430]] and confessed, [[H3034]] “O, [[H577]] Lord, [[H136]] the great [[H1419]] and awesome [[H3372]] God, [[H410]] who keeps [[H8104]] His covenant [[H1285]] of loving devotion [[H2617]] to those who love Him [[H157]] and keep [[H8104]] His commandments, [[H4687]]

###### 5
we have sinned [[H2398]] and done wrong. [[H5753]] We have acted wickedly [[H7561]] and rebelled. [[H4775]] We have turned away [[H5493]] from Your commandments [[H4687]] and ordinances. [[H4941]]

###### 6
We have not [[H3808]] listened [[H8085]] to [[H413]] Your servants [[H5650]] the prophets, [[H5030]] who [[H834]] spoke [[H1696]] in Your name [[H8034]] to [[H413]] our kings, [[H4428]] leaders, [[H8269]] fathers, [[H1]] and all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] of the land. [[H776]]

###### 7
To You,  O Lord, [[H136]] [belongs] righteousness, [[H6666]] but this [[H2088]] day [[H3117]] we are covered [[H6440]] with shame— [[H1322]] the men [[H376]] of Judah, [[H3063]] the people [[H3427]] of Jerusalem, [[H3389]] and all [[H3605]] Israel, [[H3478]] near [[H7138]] and far, [[H7350]] in all [[H3605]] the countries [[H776]] to which [[H834]] You have driven us [[H5080]] because of our unfaithfulness [[H4604]] to You. [[H4603]]

###### 8
O LORD, [[H3068]] we  are covered [[H6440]] with shame— [[H1322]] our kings, [[H4428]] our leaders, [[H8269]] and our fathers— [[H1]] because [[H834]] we have sinned [[H2398]] against You. 

###### 9
To the Lord [[H136]] our God [[H430]] [belong] compassion [[H7356]] and forgiveness, [[H5547]] even though [[H3588]] we have rebelled [[H4775]] against Him 

###### 10
and have not [[H3808]] obeyed [[H8085]] the voice [[H6963]] of the LORD [[H3069]] our God [[H430]] to walk [[H1980]] in His laws, [[H8451]] which [[H834]] He set [[H5414]] before [[H6440]] us through [[H3027]] His servants [[H5650]] the prophets. [[H5030]]

###### 11
All [[H3605]] Israel [[H3478]] has transgressed [[H5674]] Your law [[H8451]] and turned away, [[H5493]] refusing [[H1115]] to obey [[H8085]] Your voice; [[H6963]] so the oath [[H423]] and the curse [[H7621]] written [[H3789]] in the Law [[H8451]] of Moses, [[H4872]] the servant [[H5650]] of God, [[H430]] has been poured out [[H5413]] on us [[H5921]] because [[H3588]] we have sinned [[H2398]] against You. 

###### 12
You have carried out [[H6965]] the words [[H1697]] spoken [[H1696]] against [[H5921]] us and against [[H5921]] our rulers [[H8199]] by bringing [[H935]] upon us [[H5921]] a great [[H1419]] disaster. [[H7451]] For under [[H8478]] all [[H3605]] of heaven, [[H8064]] nothing [[H3808]] has ever been done [[H6213]] like what [[H834]] has been done [[H6213]] to Jerusalem. [[H3389]]

###### 13
Just as [[H834]] it is written [[H3789]] in the Law [[H8451]] of Moses, [[H4872]] all [[H3605]] this [[H2063]] disaster [[H7451]] has come [[H935]] upon us, [[H5921]] yet we have not [[H3808]] sought the favor [[H2470]] of the LORD [[H3068]] our God [[H430]] by turning [[H7725]] from our iniquities [[H5771]] and paying attention [[H7919]] to Your truth. [[H571]]

###### 14
Therefore the LORD [[H3068]] has kept the calamity [[H7451]] in store [[H8245]] and brought it [[H935]] upon us. [[H5921]] For [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] our God [[H430]] is righteous [[H6662]] in [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] He does; [[H6213]] yet we have not [[H3808]] obeyed [[H8085]] His voice. [[H6963]]

###### 15
Now, [[H6258]] O Lord [[H136]] our God, [[H430]] who [[H834]] brought [[H3318]] Your people [[H5971]] out of the land [[H776]] of Egypt [[H4714]] with a mighty [[H2389]] hand, [[H3027]] and who made [[H6213]] for Yourself  a name [[H8034]] renowned to this [[H2088]] day, [[H3117]] we have sinned, [[H2398]] we have acted wickedly. [[H7561]]

###### 16
O Lord, [[H136]] in keeping with all [[H3605]] Your righteous acts, [[H6666]] I pray [[H4994]] that Your anger [[H639]] and wrath [[H2534]] may turn away [[H7725]] from Your city [[H5892]] Jerusalem, [[H3389]] Your holy [[H6944]] hill; [[H2022]] for [[H3588]] because of our sins [[H2399]] and the iniquities [[H5771]] of our fathers, [[H1]] Jerusalem [[H3389]] and Your people [[H5971]] [are] a reproach [[H2781]] to all [[H3605]] around us. [[H5439]]

###### 17
So now, [[H6258]] our God, [[H430]] hear [[H8085]] the prayers [[H8605]] and [[H413]] petitions [[H8469]] of Your servant. [[H5650]] For Your sake, [[H4616]] O Lord, [[H136]] cause Your face [[H6440]] to shine [[H215]] upon [[H5921]] Your desolate [[H8076]] sanctuary. [[H4720]]

###### 18
Incline [[H5186]] Your ear, [[H241]] O my God, [[H430]] and hear; [[H8085]] open [[H6491]] Your eyes [[H5869]] and see [[H7200]] the desolation [[H8077]] of the city [[H5892]] that bears [[H7121]] Your name. [[H8034]] For [[H3588]] we [[H587]] are not [[H3808]] presenting [[H5307]] our petitions [[H8469]] before You [[H6440]] because of [[H5921]] our righteous acts, [[H6666]] but [[H3588]] because of [[H5921]] Your abundant [[H7227]] compassion. [[H7356]]

###### 19
O Lord, [[H136]] listen! [[H8085]] O Lord, [[H136]] forgive! [[H5545]] O Lord, [[H136]] hear [[H7181]] and act! [[H6213]] For Your sake, [[H4616]] O my God, [[H430]] do not [[H408]] delay, [[H309]] because [[H3588]] Your city [[H5892]] and Your people [[H5971]] bear [[H7121]] Your name.” [[H8034]]

###### 20
While [[H5750]] I [[H589]] was speaking, [[H1696]] praying, [[H6419]] confessing [[H3034]] my sin [[H2403]] and [that] [[H2403]] of my people [[H5971]] Israel, [[H3478]] and presenting [[H5307]] my petition [[H8467]] before [[H6440]] the LORD [[H3068]] my God [[H430]] concerning [[H5921]] [His] [[H430]] holy [[H6944]] hill— [[H2022]]

###### 21
while [[H5750]] I [[H589]] was still praying, [[H1696]] Gabriel, [[H1403]] the man [[H376]] I had seen [[H7200]] in the earlier [[H8462]] vision, [[H2377]] came [[H5060]] to me [[H413]] in swift flight [[H3288]] about the time [[H6256]] of the evening [[H6153]] sacrifice. [[H4503]]

###### 22
He instructed [me] [[H995]] and spoke [[H1696]] with me, [[H5973]] saying: [[H559]] “O Daniel, [[H1840]] I have come [[H3318]] now [[H6258]] to give you insight [[H7919]] with understanding. [[H998]]

###### 23
At the beginning [[H8462]] of your petitions, [[H8469]] an answer [[H1697]] went out, [[H3318]] and I [[H589]] have come [[H935]] to tell [you], [[H5046]] for [[H3588]] you [are] [[H859]] highly precious. [[H2530]] So consider [[H995]] the message [[H1697]] and understand [[H995]] the vision: [[H4758]]

###### 24
Seventy [[H7657]] weeks [[H7620]] are decreed [[H2852]] for [[H5921]] your people [[H5971]] and your holy [[H6944]] city [[H5892]] to stop their transgression, [[H6588]] to put an end to sin, [[H2403]] to make atonement [[H3722]] for iniquity, [[H5771]] to bring in [[H935]] everlasting [[H5769]] righteousness, [[H6664]] to seal up [[H2856]] vision [[H2377]] and prophecy, [[H5030]] and to anoint [[H4886]] the Most Holy Place. [[H6944]]

###### 25
Know [[H3045]] and understand this: [[H7919]] From [[H4480]] the issuing [[H4161]] of the decree [[H1697]] to restore [[H7725]] and rebuild [[H1129]] Jerusalem, [[H3389]] until [[H5704]] the Messiah, [[H4899]] the Prince, [[H5057]] there will be seven [[H7651]] weeks [[H7620]] and sixty-two [[H8346]] weeks. [[H7620]] It will be rebuilt [[H7725]] with streets [[H7339]] and a trench, [[H2742]] but in times [[H6256]] of distress. [[H6695]]

###### 26
Then after [[H310]] the sixty-two [[H8346]] weeks, [[H7620]] the Messiah [[H4899]] will be cut off [[H3772]] and will have nothing, [[H369]] and the people [[H5971]] of the prince [[H5057]] who is to come [[H935]] will destroy [[H7843]] the city [[H5892]] and the sanctuary. [[H6944]] The end [[H7093]] will come like a flood, [[H7858]] and until [[H5704]] the end [[H7093]] there will be war; [[H4421]] desolations [[H8074]] have been decreed. [[H2782]]

###### 27
And he will confirm [[H1396]] a covenant [[H1285]] with many [[H7227]] for one [[H259]] week, [[H7620]] but in the middle [[H2677]] of the week [[H7620]] he will put an end [[H7673]] to sacrifice [[H2077]] and offering. [[H4503]] And on [[H5921]] the wing [of the temple] [[H3671]] [will come] the abomination [[H8251]] that causes desolation, [[H8074]] until [[H5704]] the decreed [[H2782]] destruction [[H3617]] is poured out [[H5413]] upon [[H5921]] [him]. [[H8074]]
