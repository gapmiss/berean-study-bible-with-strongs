### 1
King [[H4430]] Nebuchadnezzar [[H5020]] made [[H5648]] a golden [[H1722]] statue [[H6755]] sixty [[H8361]] cubits [[H521]] high [[H7314]] and six [[H8353]] cubits [[H521]] wide, [[H6613]] and he set it up [[H6966]] on the plain [[H1236]] of Dura [[H1757]] in the province [[H4083]] of Babylon. [[H895]]

### 2
Then King [[H4430]] Nebuchadnezzar [[H5020]] sent [[H7972]] word to assemble [[H3673]] the satraps, [[H324]] prefects, [[H5460]] governors, [[H6347]] advisers, [[H148]] treasurers, [[H1411]] judges, [[H1884]] magistrates, [[H8614]] and all the other [[H3606]] officials [[H7984]] of the provinces [[H4083]] to attend [[H858]] the dedication [[H2597]] of the statue [[H6755]] [he] [[H4430]] had set up. [[H6966]]

### 3
So [[H116]] the satraps, [[H324]] prefects, [[H5460]] governors, [[H6347]] advisers, [[H148]] treasurers, [[H1411]] judges, [[H1884]] magistrates, [[H8614]] and all [[H3606]] the rulers [[H7984]] of the provinces [[H4083]] assembled [[H3673]] for the dedication [[H2597]] of the statue [[H6755]] that [[H1768]] King [[H4430]] Nebuchadnezzar [[H5020]] had set up, [[H6966]] and they stood [[H6966]] before [[H6903]] [it]. [[H6755]]

### 4
Then the herald [[H3744]] loudly [[H2429]] proclaimed, [[H7123]] “O peoples, [[H5972]] nations, [[H524]] and [men of every] language, [[H3961]] [this is what] you are commanded: [[H560]]

### 5
As soon as [[H5732]] you hear [[H8086]] the sound [[H7032]] of the horn, [[H7162]] flute, [[H4953]] zither, [[H7030]] lyre, [[H5443]] harp, [[H6460]] pipes, [[H5481]] and all [[H3606]] kinds [[H2178]] of music, [[H2170]] you must fall down [[H5308]] and worship [[H5457]] the golden [[H1722]] statue that [[H6755]] King [[H4430]] Nebuchadnezzar [[H5020]] has set up. [[H6966]]

### 6
And whoever [[H4479]] does not [[H3809]] fall down [[H5308]] and worship [[H5457]] will immediately [[H8160]] be thrown [[H7412]] into [[H1459]] the burning [[H3345]] fiery [[H5135]] furnace.” [[H861]]

### 7
Therefore, [[H3606]] as soon as [[H1768]] all [[H3606]] the people [[H5972]] heard [[H8086]] the sound [[H7032]] of the horn, [[H7162]] flute, [[H4953]] zither, [[H7030]] lyre, [[H5443]] harp, [[H6460]] and all [[H3606]] kinds [[H2178]] of music, [[H2170]] the people [[H5972]] of every [[H3606]] nation [[H524]] and language [[H3961]] fell down [[H5308]] and worshiped [[H5457]] the golden [[H1722]] statue [[H6755]] that [[H1768]] King [[H4430]] Nebuchadnezzar [[H5020]] had set up. [[H6966]]

### 8
At this time [[H1836]] some astrologers [[H3779]] came forward [[H7127]] and maliciously [[H399]] accused [[H7170]] the Jews, [[H3062]]

### 9
saying [[H6032]] to King [[H4430]] Nebuchadnezzar, [[H5020]] “O king, [[H4430]] may you live [[H2418]] forever! [[H5957]]

### 10
You, [[H607]] O king, [[H4430]] have issued [[H7761]] a decree [[H2942]] that [[H1768]] everyone [[H3606]] who [[H1768]] hears [[H8086]] the sound [[H7032]] of the horn, [[H7162]] flute, [[H4953]] zither, [[H7030]] lyre, [[H5443]] harp, [[H6460]] pipes, [[H5481]] and all [[H3606]] kinds [[H2178]] of music [[H2170]] must fall down [[H5308]] and worship [[H5457]] the golden [[H1722]] statue, [[H6755]]

### 11
and that whoever [[H4479]] does not [[H3809]] fall down [[H5308]] and worship [[H5457]] will be thrown [[H7412]] into [[H1459]] the burning [[H3345]] fiery [[H5135]] furnace. [[H861]]

### 12
But there are [[H383]] some Jews [[H3062]] you have appointed [[H4483]] to manage [[H5922]] the province [[H4083]] of Babylon— [[H895]] Shadrach, [[H7715]] Meshach, [[H4336]] and Abednego— [[H5665]] [who] [[H479]] have ignored [[H3809]] you, [[H2942]] O king, [[H4430]] and have refused to [[H3809]] serve [[H6399]] your gods [[H426]] or worship [[H5457]] the golden [[H1722]] statue [[H6755]] you have set up.” [[H6966]]

### 13
Then [[H116]] Nebuchadnezzar, [[H5020]] furious [[H2528]] with rage, [[H7266]] summoned [[H560]] Shadrach, [[H7715]] Meshach, [[H4336]] and Abednego. [[H5665]] So [[H116]] these [[H479]] men [[H1400]] were brought [[H858]] before [[H6925]] the king, [[H4430]]

### 14
and Nebuchadnezzar [[H5020]] said [[H560]] to them,  “Shadrach, [[H7715]] Meshach, [[H4336]] and Abednego, [[H5665]] is it true [[H6656]] that you do not [[H3809]] serve [[H6399]] my gods [[H426]] or worship [[H5457]] the golden [[H1722]] statue [[H6755]] I have set up? [[H6966]]

### 15
Now, [[H3705]] if [[H2006]] you are ready, [[H6263]] as soon as [[H5732]] you hear [[H8086]] the sound [[H7032]] of the horn, [[H7162]] flute, [[H4953]] zither, [[H7030]] lyre, [[H5443]] harp, [[H6460]] pipes, [[H5481]] and all [[H3606]] kinds [[H2178]] of music, [[H2170]] you must fall down [[H5308]] and worship [[H5457]] the statue [[H6755]] I have made. [[H5648]] But if [[H2006]] you refuse [[H3809]] to worship, [[H5457]] you will be thrown [[H7412]] immediately [[H8160]] into [[H1459]] the burning [[H3345]] fiery [[H5135]] furnace. [[H861]] Then what [[H4479]] god [[H426]] will be able [[H1932]] to deliver you [[H7804]] from [[H4481]] my hands? [[H3028]]

### 16
Shadrach, [[H7715]] Meshach, [[H4336]] and Abednego [[H5665]] replied [[H6032]] to the king, [[H4430]] “O Nebuchadnezzar, [[H5020]] we [[H586]] have [[H3809]] no need [[H2818]] to answer you [[H8421]] in [[H5922]] this [[H1836]] matter. [[H6600]]

### 17
If [[H2006]] the God [[H426]] whom [[H1768]] we [[H586]] serve [[H6399]] exists, [[H383]] then He is able [[H3202]] to deliver us [[H7804]] from [[H4481]] the burning [[H3345]] fiery [[H5135]] furnace [[H861]] and from [[H4481]] your hand, [[H3028]] O king. [[H4430]]

### 18
But even if [[H2006]] He does not, [[H3809]] let it [[H1934]] be known [[H3046]] to you,  O king, [[H4430]] that [[H1768]] we will not [[H3809]] serve [[H6399]] your gods [[H426]] or worship [[H5457]] the golden [[H1722]] statue [[H6755]] you have set up.” [[H6966]]

### 19
At this, [[H116]] Nebuchadnezzar [[H5020]] was filled [[H4391]] with rage, [[H2528]] and the expression [[H6755]] on his face [[H600]] changed [[H8133]] toward [[H5922]] Shadrach, [[H7715]] Meshach, [[H4336]] and Abednego. [[H5665]] He gave orders [[H6032]] to heat [[H228]] the furnace [[H861]] seven times [[H7655]] hotter [[H5922]] than [[H1768]] usual, [[H2370]]

### 20
and he commanded [[H560]] mighty warriors [[H1401]] in his army [[H2429]] to tie up [[H3729]] Shadrach, [[H7715]] Meshach, [[H4336]] and Abednego [[H5665]] and throw them [[H7412]] into the burning [[H3345]] fiery [[H5135]] furnace. [[H861]]

### 21
So [[H116]] [they] [[H479]] were tied up, [[H3729]] wearing robes, [[H5622]] trousers, [[H6361]] turbans, [[H3737]] and other clothes, [[H3831]] and they were thrown [[H7412]] into [[H1459]] the burning [[H3345]] fiery [[H5135]] furnace. [[H861]]

### 22
The king’s [[H4430]] command [[H4406]] was so urgent [[H2685]] and the furnace [[H861]] so [[H3493]] hot [[H228]] that the fiery [[H5135]] flames [[H7631]] killed [[H6992]] the [[H479]] men [[H1400]] who [[H1768]] carried up [[H5267]] Shadrach, [[H7715]] Meshach, [[H4336]] and Abednego. [[H5665]]

### 23
And these [[H479]] three [[H8532]] men, [[H1400]] Shadrach, [[H7715]] Meshach, [[H4336]] and Abednego, [[H5665]] firmly bound, [[H3729]] fell [[H5308]] into [[H1459]] the burning [[H3345]] fiery [[H5135]] furnace. [[H861]]

### 24
Suddenly [[H116]] King [[H4430]] Nebuchadnezzar [[H5020]] jumped up [[H6966]] in amazement [[H927]] and asked [[H560]] his advisers, [[H1907]] “Did we not [[H3809]] throw [[H7412]] three [[H8532]] men, [[H1400]] firmly bound, [[H3729]] into [[H1459]] the fire?” [[H5135]] “Certainly, [[H3330]] O king,” [[H4430]] they replied. [[H6032]]

### 25
“Look!” [[H1888]] he exclaimed. [[H560]] “I [[H576]] see [[H2370]] four [[H703]] men, [[H1400]] unbound [[H8271]] and unharmed, [[H2257]] walking around [[H1981]] in [[H1459]] the fire— [[H5135]] and the fourth [[H7244]] looks [[H7299]] like [[H1821]] a son [[H1247]] of the gods!” [[H426]]

### 26
Then [[H116]] Nebuchadnezzar [[H5020]] approached [[H7127]] the door [[H8651]] of the burning [[H3345]] fiery [[H5135]] furnace [[H861]] and called out, [[H560]] “Shadrach, [[H7715]] Meshach, [[H4336]] and Abednego, [[H5665]] servants [[H5649]] of the Most High [[H5943]] God, [[H426]] come out!” [[H5312]] So [[H116]] Shadrach, [[H7715]] Meshach, [[H4336]] and Abednego [[H5665]] came out [[H5312]] of [[H4481]] the fire, [[H5135]]

### 27
and when the satraps, [[H324]] prefects, [[H5460]] governors, [[H6347]] and royal [[H4430]] advisers [[H1907]] had gathered around, [[H3673]] they saw [[H2370]] that the fire [[H5135]] had no [[H3809]] effect [[H7981]] on the bodies [[H1655]] of these [[H479]] men: [[H1400]] Not [[H3809]] a hair [[H8177]] of their heads [[H7217]] was singed, [[H2761]] their robes [[H5622]] were unaffected, [[H3809]] and there was no [[H3809]] smell [[H7382]] of fire on them. [[H5135]]

### 28
Nebuchadnezzar [[H5020]] declared, [[H6032]] “Blessed [[H1289]] be the God [[H426]] of [[H1768]] Shadrach, [[H7715]] Meshach, [[H4336]] and  Abednego, [[H5665]] who has sent [[H7972]] His Angel [[H4398]] and delivered [[H7804]] His servants [[H5649]] who [[H1768]] trusted [[H7365]] in Him. [[H5922]] They violated [[H8133]] the king’s [[H4430]] command [[H4406]] and risked their lives [[H1655]] rather than serve [[H6399]] or worship [[H5457]] any [[H3606]] god [[H426]] except [[H3861]] their own God. [[H426]]

### 29
Therefore I [[H4481]] decree [[H7761]] that [[H1768]] the people [[H5972]] of any [[H3606]] nation [[H524]] or language [[H3961]] who [[H1768]] say [[H560]] anything offensive [[H7955]] against [[H5922]] the God [[H426]] of [[H1768]] Shadrach, [[H7715]] Meshach, [[H4336]] and Abednego [[H5665]] will be cut [[H5648]] into pieces [[H1917]] and their houses [[H1005]] will be reduced [[H7739]] to rubble. [[H5122]] For [[H6903]] there is [[H383]] no [[H3809]] other [[H321]] god [[H426]] who [[H1768]] can [[H3202]] deliver [[H5338]] in this way. [[H1836]]

### 30
Then [[H116]] the king [[H4430]] promoted [[H6744]] Shadrach, [[H7715]] Meshach, [[H4336]] and Abednego [[H5665]] in the province [[H4083]] of Babylon. [[H895]]
