###### 1
And I, [[H589]] in the first [[H259]] year [[H8141]] of Darius [[H1867]] the Mede, [[H4075]] stood up [[H5975]] to strengthen [[H2388]] and protect [[H4581]] him. 

###### 2
Now then, [[H6258]] I will tell [[H5046]] you the truth: [[H571]] Three [[H7969]] more [[H5750]] kings [[H4428]] will arise [[H5975]] in Persia, [[H6539]] and then a fourth, [[H7243]] who will be [[H6239]] far [[H1419]] richer [than the others]. [[H6238]] By the power [[H2393]] of his wealth, [[H6239]] he will stir up [[H5782]] everyone [[H3605]] against the kingdom [[H4438]] of Greece. [[H3120]]

###### 3
Then a mighty [[H1368]] king [[H4428]] will arise, [[H5975]] who will rule [[H4910]] with great [[H7227]] authority [[H4474]] and do [[H6213]] as he pleases. [[H7522]]

###### 4
But as soon as he is established, [[H5975]] his kingdom [[H4438]] will be broken up [[H7665]] and parceled [[H2673]] out toward the four [[H702]] winds [[H7307]] of heaven. [[H8064]] It will not [go] [[H3808]] to his descendants, [[H319]] nor will it [[H3808]] have the authority [[H4915]] with which [[H834]] he ruled, [[H4910]] because [[H3588]] his kingdom [[H4438]] will be uprooted [[H5428]] and [given] to others. [[H312]]

###### 5
The king [[H4428]] of the South [[H5045]] will grow strong, [[H2388]] but one of [[H4480]] his commanders [[H8269]] will grow even [[H5921]] stronger [[H2388]] and will rule [[H4910]] his own kingdom [[H4474]] with great [[H7227]] authority. [[H4475]]

###### 6
After [[H7093]] some years [[H8141]] they will form an alliance, [[H2266]] and the daughter [[H1323]] of the king [[H4428]] of the South [[H5045]] will go [[H935]] to [[H413]] the king [[H4428]] of the North [[H6828]] to seal [[H6213]] the agreement. [[H4339]] But [his daughter] will not [[H3808]] retain [[H6113]] her position of power, [[H3581]] nor will [[H3808]] his strength [[H2220]] endure. [[H5975]] At that time [[H6256]] she [[H1931]] will be given up, [[H5414]] along with her royal escort [[H935]] and her father [[H3205]] and the one who supported her. [[H2388]]

###### 7
But one from her family line [[H5342]] will rise up [[H5975]] in his place, [[H3653]] come [[H935]] against [[H413]] the army [[H2428]] of the king [[H4428]] of the North, [[H6828]] and enter [[H935]] his fortress, [[H4581]] fighting [[H6213]] and prevailing. [[H2388]]

###### 8
He will take [[H935]] even [[H1571]] their gods [[H430]] captive [[H7628]] to Egypt, [[H4714]] with [[H5973]] their metal images [[H5257]] and their precious [[H2532]] vessels [[H3627]] of silver [[H3701]] and gold. [[H2091]] For some years [[H8141]] he [[H1931]] will stay away [[H5975]] from the king [[H4428]] of the North, [[H6828]]

###### 9
who will invade [[H935]] the realm [[H4438]] of the king [[H4428]] of the South [[H5045]] and then return [[H7725]] to [[H413]] his own land. [[H127]]

###### 10
But his sons [[H1121]] will stir up strife [[H1624]] and assemble [[H622]] a great [[H7227]] army, [[H1995]] which will advance forcefully, [[H935]] sweeping through [[H5674]] like a flood, [[H7857]] and will again [[H7725]] carry the battle [[H1624]] as [[H5704]] far as his fortress. [[H4581]]

###### 11
In a rage, [[H4843]] the king [[H4428]] of the South [[H5045]] will march out [[H3318]] to fight [[H3898]] the king [[H4428]] of the North, [[H6828]] who will raise [[H5975]] a large [[H7227]] army, [[H1995]] but it [[H1995]] will be given over [[H5414]] to the hand of his [enemy]. [[H3027]]

###### 12
When the army [[H1995]] is carried off, [[H5375]] [the king of the South] will be proud [[H7311]] in heart [[H3824]] and cast down [[H5307]] tens of thousands, [[H7239]] but he will not [[H3808]] triumph. [[H5810]]

###### 13
For the king [[H4428]] of the North [[H6828]] will raise [[H5975]] another [[H7725]] army, [[H1995]] larger [[H7227]] than [[H4480]] the first, [[H7223]] and after [[H7093]] some years [[H8141]] he will advance [[H935]] with a great [[H1419]] army [[H2428]] and many [[H7227]] supplies. [[H7399]]

###### 14
In those [[H1992]] times [[H6256]] many [[H7227]] will rise up [[H5975]] against [[H5921]] the king [[H4428]] of the South. [[H5045]] Violent [[H6530]] ones [[H1121]] among your own people [[H5971]] will exalt themselves [[H5375]] in fulfillment [[H5975]] of the vision, [[H2377]] but they will fail. [[H3782]]

###### 15
Then the king [[H4428]] of the North [[H6828]] will come, [[H935]] build up [[H8210]] a siege mound, [[H5550]] and capture [[H3920]] a fortified [[H4013]] city. [[H5892]] The forces [[H2220]] of the South [[H5045]] will not [[H3808]] stand; [[H5975]] even their best [[H4005]] troops [[H5971]] will not [[H369]] be able [[H3581]] to resist. [[H5975]]

###### 16
The invader [[H935]] will do [[H6213]] as he pleases, [[H7522]] and no one [[H369]] will stand [[H5975]] against him. [[H6440]] He will establish [[H5975]] himself in the Beautiful [[H6643]] Land, [[H776]] with destruction [[H3615]] in his hand. [[H3027]]

###### 17
He will resolve [[H7760]] to come [[H935]] with the strength [[H8633]] of his whole [[H3605]] kingdom, [[H4438]] and will reach an agreement [[H3477]] with [the king of the South]. [[H5973]] He will give him a daughter [[H1323]] in marriage [[H802]] in order to overthrow [the kingdom], [[H7843]] but [his plan] will not [[H3808]] succeed [[H5975]] or help him. [[H3808]]

###### 18
Then he will turn [[H7725]] his face [[H6440]] to the coastlands [[H339]] and capture [[H3920]] many of them. [[H7227]] But a commander [[H7101]] will put an end [[H7673]] to his reproach [[H2781]] and will turn it back [[H7725]] upon him. 

###### 19
After this, he will turn back [[H6440]] his face [[H7725]] to the fortresses [[H4581]] of his own land, [[H776]] but he will stumble [[H3782]] and fall [[H5307]] and be no more. [[H3808]]

###### 20
In [[H5921]] his place [[H3653]] one will arise [[H5975]] who will send out [[H5674]] a tax collector [[H5065]] for the glory [[H1925]] of the kingdom; [[H4438]] but within a few [[H259]] days [[H3117]] he will be destroyed, [[H7665]] though not [[H3808]] in anger [[H639]] or in battle. [[H4421]]

###### 21
In [[H5921]] his place [[H3653]] a despicable person [[H959]] will arise; [[H5975]] royal [[H4438]] honors [[H1935]] will not [[H3808]] be given [[H5414]] to him, [[H5921]] but he will come [[H935]] in a time of peace [[H7962]] and seize [[H2388]] the kingdom [[H4438]] by intrigue. [[H2519]]

###### 22
Then a flood [[H7858]] of forces [[H2220]] will be swept away [[H7857]] before him [[H6440]] and destroyed, [[H7665]] along with [[H1571]] a prince [[H5057]] of the covenant. [[H1285]]

###### 23
After [[H4480]] an alliance is made [[H2266]] with him, [[H413]] he will act [[H6213]] deceitfully; [[H4820]] for he will rise [[H5927]] to power [[H6105]] with only a few [[H4592]] people. [[H1471]]

###### 24
In a time of peace, [[H7962]] he will invade [[H935]] the richest [[H4924]] provinces [[H4082]] and do [[H6213]] what [[H834]] his fathers [[H1]] and forefathers [[H1]] never [[H3808]] did. [[H6213]] He will lavish [on his followers] [[H967]] plunder, [[H961]] loot, [[H7998]] and wealth, [[H7399]] and he will plot [[H2803]] against [[H5921]] the strongholds— [[H4013]] but only for [[H5704]] a time. [[H6256]]

###### 25
And with a large [[H1419]] army [[H2428]] he will stir up [[H5782]] his power [[H3581]] and his courage [[H3824]] against [[H5921]] the king [[H4428]] of the South, [[H5045]] [who] [[H4428]] will mobilize [[H1624]] a very [[H5704]] large [[H1419]] and powerful [[H6099]] army [[H2428]] but will not [[H3808]] withstand [[H5975]] the plots [[H4284]] devised [[H2803]] against him. [[H5921]]

###### 26
Those who eat [[H398]] from  his provisions [[H6598]] will seek to destroy him; [[H7665]] his army [[H2428]] will be swept away, [[H7857]] and many [[H7227]] will fall [[H5307]] slain. [[H2491]]

###### 27
And the two [[H8147]] kings, [[H4428]] with their hearts [[H3824]] bent on evil, [[H4827]] will speak [[H1696]] lies [[H3577]] at [[H5921]] the same [[H259]] table, [[H7979]] but to no [[H3808]] avail, [[H6743]] for [[H3588]] still [[H5750]] the end [[H7093]] will come at the appointed time. [[H4150]]

###### 28
The king of the North will return [[H7725]] to his land [[H776]] with great [[H1419]] wealth, [[H7399]] but his heart [[H3824]] will be set against [[H5921]] the holy [[H6944]] covenant; [[H1285]] so he will do [damage] [[H6213]] and return [[H7725]] to his own land. [[H776]]

###### 29
At the appointed time [[H4150]] he will invade [[H935]] the South [[H5045]] again, [[H7725]] but this time will not [[H3808]] be [[H1961]] like the first. [[H7223]]

###### 30
Ships [[H6716]] of Kittim [[H3794]] will come [[H935]] against him,  and he will lose heart. [[H3512]] Then he will turn back [[H7725]] and rage [[H2194]] against [[H5921]] the holy [[H6944]] covenant [[H1285]] and do [damage]. [[H6213]] So he will return [[H7725]] and show favor [[H995]] to [[H5921]] those who forsake [[H5800]] the holy [[H6944]] covenant. [[H1285]]

###### 31
His [[H4480]] forces [[H2220]] will rise up [[H5975]] and desecrate [[H2490]] the temple [[H4720]] fortress. [[H4581]] They will abolish [[H5493]] the daily sacrifice [[H8548]] and set up [[H5414]] the abomination [[H8251]] of desolation. [[H8074]]

###### 32
With flattery [[H2514]] he will corrupt [[H2610]] those who violate [[H7561]] the covenant, [[H1285]] but the people [[H5971]] who know [[H3045]] their God [[H430]] will firmly [[H2388]] resist [him]. [[H6213]]

###### 33
Those with insight [[H7919]] will instruct [[H995]] many, [[H7227]] though for a time [[H3117]] they will fall [[H3782]] by sword [[H2719]] and flame [[H3852]] or be captured [[H7628]] or plundered. [[H961]]

###### 34
Now when they fall, [[H3782]] they will be granted [[H5826]] a little [[H4592]] help, [[H5828]] but many [[H7227]] will join [[H3867]] them [[H5921]] insincerely. [[H2519]]

###### 35
Some of [[H4480]] the wise [[H7919]] will fall, [[H3782]] so that they may be refined, [[H6884]] purified, [[H1305]] and made spotless [[H3835]] until [[H5704]] the time [[H6256]] of the end, [[H7093]] for [[H3588]] it will still [[H5750]] come at the appointed time. [[H4150]]

###### 36
Then the king [[H4428]] will do [[H6213]] as he pleases [[H7522]] and will exalt [[H7311]] and magnify [[H1431]] himself above [[H5921]] every [[H3605]] god, [[H410]] and he will speak [[H1696]] monstrous things [[H6381]] against [[H5921]] the God [[H410]] of gods. [[H410]] He will be successful [[H6743]] until [[H5704]] the time of wrath [[H2195]] is completed, [[H3615]] for [[H3588]] what has been decreed [[H2782]] must be accomplished. [[H6213]]

###### 37
He will show no regard [[H995]] for [[H5921]] the gods [[H430]] of his fathers, [[H1]] nor for the one desired [[H2532]] by women, [[H802]] nor for [[H5921]] any [[H3605]] other god, [[H433]] because [[H3588]] he will magnify [[H1431]] himself above [[H5921]] [them] all. [[H3605]]

###### 38
And in [[H5921]] their place, [[H3653]] he will honor [[H3513]] a god [[H433]] of fortresses— [[H4581]] a god [[H433]] his fathers [[H1]] did not [[H3808]] know— [[H3045]] with gold, [[H2091]] silver, [[H3701]] precious [[H3368]] stones, [[H68]] and riches. [[H2530]]

###### 39
He will attack [[H6213]] the strongest fortresses [[H4013]] with [[H5973]] the help of a foreign [[H5236]] god [[H433]] and will greatly [[H7235]] honor [[H3519]] those who [[H834]] acknowledge him, [[H5234]] making them rulers [[H4910]] over many [[H7227]] and distributing [[H2505]] land [[H127]] for a price. [[H4242]]

###### 40
At the time [[H6256]] of the end, [[H7093]] the king [[H4428]] of the South [[H5045]] will engage him in battle, [[H5055]] but the king [[H4428]] of the North [[H6828]] will storm out [[H8175]] against him [[H5921]] with chariots, [[H7393]] horsemen, [[H6571]] and many [[H7227]] ships, [[H591]] invading [[H935]] [many] countries [[H776]] and sweeping through them [[H5674]] like a flood. [[H7857]]

###### 41
He will also invade [[H935]] the Beautiful [[H6643]] Land, [[H776]] and many [countries] [[H7227]] will fall. [[H3782]] But these [[H428]] will be delivered [[H4422]] from his hand: [[H3027]] Edom, [[H123]] Moab, [[H4124]] and the leaders [[H7225]] of the Ammonites. [[H1121]]

###### 42
He will extend [[H7971]] his power [[H3027]] over [many] countries, [[H776]] and not even [[H3808]] the land [[H776]] of Egypt [[H4714]] will escape. [[H6413]]

###### 43
He will gain control [[H4910]] of the treasures [[H4362]] of gold [[H2091]] and silver [[H3701]] and over all [[H3605]] the riches [[H2530]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] and the Libyans [[H3864]] and Cushites [[H3569]] will also submit to him. [[H4703]]

###### 44
But news [[H8052]] from the east [[H4217]] and the north [[H6828]] will alarm him, [[H926]] and he will go out [[H3318]] with great [[H1419]] fury [[H2534]] to destroy [[H8045]] and annihilate [[H2763]] many. [[H7227]]

###### 45
He will pitch [[H5193]] his royal [[H643]] tents [[H168]] between [[H996]] the sea [[H3220]] and the beautiful [[H6643]] holy [[H6944]] mountain, [[H2022]] but he will meet [[H935]] his end [[H7093]] with no one [[H369]] to help [[H5826]] him.
