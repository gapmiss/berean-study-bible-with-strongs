###### 1
At that [[H1931]] time [[H6256]] Michael, [[H4317]] the great [[H1419]] prince [[H8269]] who stands watch [[H5975]] over [[H5921]] your people, [[H1121]] will rise up. [[H5975]] There will be [[H1961]] a time [[H6256]] of distress [[H6869]] such as [[H834]] never [[H3808]] has occurred [[H1961]] from the beginning [[H1961]] of nations [[H1471]] until [[H5704]] then. [[H6256]] But at that [[H1931]] time [[H6256]] your people [[H5971]] everyone [whose name] [[H3605]] is found [[H4672]] written [[H3789]] in the book [[H5612]] will be delivered. [[H4422]]

###### 2
And many [[H7227]] who sleep [[H3463]] in the dust [[H6083]] of the earth [[H127]] will awake, [[H6974]] some [[H428]] to everlasting [[H5769]] life, [[H2416]] but others [[H428]] to shame [[H2781]] [and] everlasting [[H5769]] contempt. [[H1860]]

###### 3
Then the wise [[H7919]] will shine [[H2094]] like the brightness [[H2096]] of the heavens, [[H7549]] and those who lead many [[H7227]] to righteousness, [[H6663]] like the stars [[H3556]] forever [[H5769]] and ever. [[H5703]]

###### 4
But you, [[H859]] Daniel, [[H1840]] shut up [[H5640]] these words [[H1697]] and seal [[H2856]] the book [[H5612]] until [[H5704]] the time [[H6256]] of the end. [[H7093]] Many [[H7227]] will roam to and fro, [[H7751]] and knowledge [[H1847]] will increase.” [[H7235]]

###### 5
Then I, [[H589]] Daniel, [[H1840]] looked [[H7200]] and saw [[H2009]] two [[H8147]] others [[H312]] standing [[H5975]] there, [[H2008]] one [[H259]] on this bank [[H8193]] of the river [[H2975]] and one [[H259]] on the opposite [[H2008]] bank. [[H8193]]

###### 6
One of them said [[H559]] to the man [[H376]] dressed [[H3847]] in linen, [[H906]] who [[H834]] was above [[H4605]] the waters [[H4325]] of the river, [[H2975]] “How long [[H4970]] until [[H5704]] the fulfillment [[H7093]] of these wonders?” [[H6382]]

###### 7
And the man [[H376]] dressed [[H3847]] in linen, [[H906]] who [[H834]] was above [[H4605]] the waters [[H4325]] of the river, [[H2975]] raised [[H7311]] his right hand [[H3225]] and his left hand [[H8040]] toward [[H413]] heaven, [[H8064]] and I heard [[H8085]] him swear [[H7650]] by Him who lives [[H2416]] forever, [[H5769]] saying, [[H3588]] “It will be for a time, [[H4150]] times, [[H4150]] and half a time. [[H2677]] When the power [[H3027]] of the holy [[H6944]] people [[H5971]] has been shattered, [[H5310]] all [[H3605]] these [[H428]] things will be completed. [[H3615]]

###### 8
I [[H589]] heard, [[H8085]] but I did not [[H3808]] understand. [[H995]] So I asked, [[H559]] “My lord, [[H113]] what [[H4100]] will be the outcome [[H319]] of these [things]?” [[H428]]

###### 9
“Go on your way, [[H1980]] Daniel,” [[H1840]] he replied, [[H559]] “for [[H3588]] the words [[H1697]] [are] closed up [[H5640]] and sealed [[H2856]] until [[H5704]] the time [[H6256]] of the end. [[H7093]]

###### 10
Many [[H7227]] will be purified, [[H1305]] made spotless, [[H3835]] and refined, [[H6884]] but the wicked [[H7563]] will continue to act wickedly. [[H7561]] None [[H3808]] of the wicked [[H7563]] will understand, [[H995]] but the wise [[H7919]] will understand. [[H995]]

###### 11
And from the time [[H6256]] the daily [sacrifice] [[H8548]] is abolished [[H5493]] and the abomination [[H8251]] of desolation [[H8074]] set up, [[H5414]] there will be 1,290 [[H505]] days. [[H3117]]

###### 12
Blessed [is] [[H835]] he who waits [[H2442]] and reaches the end [[H5060]] of the 1,335 [[H505]] days. [[H3117]]

###### 13
But as for you, [[H859]] go on your way [[H1980]] until the end. [[H7093]] You will rest, [[H5117]] and will arise [[H5975]] to your inheritance [[H1486]] at the end [[H7093]] of the days.” [[H3117]]
