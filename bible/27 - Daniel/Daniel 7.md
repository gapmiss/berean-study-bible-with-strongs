### 1
In the first [[H2298]] year [[H8140]] of the reign [[H4430]] of Belshazzar [[H1113]] over Babylon, [[H895]] Daniel [[H1841]] had [[H2370]] a dream, [[H2493]] and visions [[H2376]] passed through his mind [[H7217]] as he lay [[H5922]] on his bed. [[H4903]] He wrote down [[H3790]] the dream, [[H2493]] and this is the summary [[H7217]] of his account. [[H4406]]

### 2
Daniel [[H1841]] declared: [[H6032]] “In my vision [[H2376]] in [[H5974]] the night [[H3916]] I [[H1934]] looked, [[H2370]] and suddenly [[H718]] the four [[H703]] winds [[H7308]] of heaven [[H8065]] were churning up [[H1519]] the Great [[H7229]] Sea. [[H3221]]

### 3
Then four [[H703]] great [[H7260]] beasts [[H2423]] came up [[H5559]] out of [[H4481]] the sea, [[H3221]] each [[H1668]] different [[H8133]] from [[H4481]] the others. [[H1668]]

### 4
The first [beast] [[H6933]] was like a lion, [[H744]] and it had  [the] wings [[H1611]] of an eagle. [[H5403]] I [[H1934]] watched [[H2370]] until [[H5705]] its wings [[H1611]] were torn off [[H4804]] and it was lifted up [[H5191]] from [[H4481]] the ground [[H772]] and made to stand [[H6966]] on [[H5922]] two feet [[H7271]] like a man, [[H606]] and given [[H3052]] the mind [[H3825]] of a man. [[H606]]

### 5
Suddenly [[H718]] another [[H317]] beast {appeared}, [[H2423]] which [[H8578]] looked like [[H1821]] a bear. [[H1678]] It was raised up [[H6966]] on one [[H2298]] of its sides, [[H7859]] and it had three [[H8532]] ribs [[H5967]] in its mouth [[H6433]] between [[H997]] its teeth. [[H8128]] So [[H3652]] it was told, [[H560]] ‘Get up [[H6966]] [and] gorge [[H399]] yourself on flesh!’ [[H1321]]

### 6
Next, [[H870]] as I [[H1934]] watched, [[H2370]] another beast [[H317]] appeared. [[H718]] It was like a leopard, [[H5245]] and on [[H5922]] its back [[H1355]] it had  four [[H703]] wings [[H1611]] like those of [[H1768]] a bird. [[H5776]] The beast also [[H2423]] had four [[H703]] heads, [[H7217]] and it was given [[H3052]] authority to rule. [[H7985]]

### 7
After [[H870]] this, [[H1836]] as I [[H1934]] watched [[H2370]] in my vision [[H2376]] in the night, [[H3916]] suddenly [[H718]] a fourth [[H7244]] beast {appeared}, [[H2423]] [and it was] terrifying— [[H1763]] dreadful [[H574]] and extremely [[H3493]] strong— [[H8624]] with  large [[H7260]] iron [[H6523]] teeth. [[H8128]] It devoured [[H399]] and crushed; [[H1855]] then it trampled [[H7512]] underfoot [[H7271]] whatever was left. [[H7606]] It was different [[H8133]] from [[H4481]] all [[H3606]] the beasts [[H2423]] before it, [[H6925]] and it had ten [[H6236]] horns. [[H7162]]

### 8
While I was [[H1934]] contemplating [[H7920]] the horns, [[H7162]] suddenly another [[H317]] horn, [[H7162]] a little one, [[H2192]] came up [[H5559]] among them, [[H997]] and three [[H8532]] of [[H4481]] the first [[H6933]] horns [[H7162]] were uprooted [[H6132]] before [[H4481]] it. [[H6925]] This [[H1668]] horn [[H7162]] had eyes [[H5870]] like those [[H5870]] of a man [[H606]] and a mouth [[H6433]] that spoke [[H4449]] words of arrogance. [[H7260]]

### 9
As [[H5705]] I continued [[H1934]] to watch: [[H2370]] Thrones [[H3764]] were set in place, [[H7412]] and the Ancient [[H6268]] of Days [[H3118]] took His seat. [[H3488]] His clothing [[H3831]] was white [[H2358]] as snow, [[H8517]] and the hair [[H8177]] of His head [[H7217]] like pure [[H5343]] wool. [[H6015]] His throne [[H3764]] was flaming [[H7631]] with fire, [[H5135]] and its wheels [[H1535]] were all ablaze. [[H1815]]

### 10
A river [[H5103]] of [[H1768]] fire [[H5135]] was flowing, [[H5047]] coming out [[H5312]] from His presence. [[H4481]] Thousands [[H506]] upon thousands  attended Him, [[H8120]] and myriads [[H7240]] upon myriads [[H7240]] stood [[H6966]] before Him. [[H6925]] The court [[H1780]] was convened, [[H3488]] and the books [[H5609]] were opened. [[H6606]]

### 11
Then [[H116]] I kept watching [[H2370]] because of [[H4481]] the arrogant [[H7260]] words [[H4406]] the horn [[H7162]] was speaking. [[H4449]] As [[H5705]] I continued [[H1934]] to watch, [[H2370]] the beast [[H2423]] was slain, [[H6992]] and its body [[H1655]] was destroyed [[H7]] and thrown into [[H3052]] the blazing [[H3346]] fire. [[H785]]

### 12
As for the rest [[H7606]] of the beasts, [[H2423]] their dominion [[H7985]] was removed, [[H5709]] but they were granted [[H3052]] an extension [[H754]] of life [[H2417]] for [[H5705]] a season [[H2166]] of time. [[H5732]]

### 13
In my vision [[H2376]] in the night [[H3916]] I continued [[H1934]] to watch: [[H2370]] And I saw [[H718]] One like a Son [[H1247]] of Man [[H606]] coming [[H858]] with [[H5974]] the clouds [[H6050]] of heaven. [[H8065]] He approached [[H4291]] the Ancient [[H6268]] of Days [[H3118]] and was led [[H7127]] into His presence. [[H6925]]

### 14
And  He was given [[H3052]] dominion, [[H7985]] glory, [[H3367]] and kingship, [[H4437]] so that every [[H3606]] people, [[H5972]] nation, [[H524]] and language [[H3961]] should serve Him. [[H6399]] His dominion [[H7985]] is an everlasting [[H5957]] dominion [[H7985]] that [[H1768]] will not [[H3809]] pass away, [[H5709]] and His kingdom is one [[H4437]] that [[H1768]] will never [[H3809]] be destroyed. [[H2255]]

### 15
I, [[H576]] Daniel, [[H1841]] was grieved [[H3735]] in [[H1459]] my spirit, [[H7308]] and the visions [[H2376]] in my mind [[H7217]] alarmed me. [[H927]]

### 16
I approached [[H7127]] one [[H2298]] of [[H4481]] those who stood by, [[H6966]] and I asked [[H1156]] him [[H4481]] the true meaning [[H3330]] of [[H5922]] all [[H3606]] this. [[H1836]] So he told [[H560]] me  the interpretation [[H6591]] of these things: [[H4406]]

### 17
‘These [[H459]] four [[H703]] great [[H7260]] beasts [[H2423]] are [[H581]] four [[H703]] kings [[H4430]] [who] will arise [[H6966]] from [[H4481]] the earth. [[H772]]

### 18
But the saints [[H6922]] of the Most High [[H5946]] will receive [[H6902]] the kingdom [[H4437]] and possess [[H2631]] it [[H4437]] forever— [[H5705]] yes, forever [[H5705]] and ever.’ [[H5957]]

### 19
Then [[H116]] I wanted [[H6634]] to know the true meaning [[H3321]] of [[H5922]] the fourth [[H7244]] beast, [[H2423]] which [[H1768]] was [[H1934]] different [[H8133]] from [[H4481]] all the [others]— [[H3605]] extremely [[H3493]] terrifying— [[H1763]] with iron [[H6523]] teeth [[H8128]] and bronze [[H5174]] claws, [[H2953]] devouring, [[H399]] crushing, [[H1855]] and trampling [[H7512]] underfoot [[H7271]] whatever was left. [[H7606]]

### 20
I also wanted to know about [[H5922]] the ten [[H6236]] horns [[H7162]] on its head [[H7217]] and the other [[H317]] horn that [[H1768]] came up, [[H5559]] before which [[H6925]] three of them [[H8532]] fell— [[H5308]] the horn [[H7162]] whose appearance [was] [[H2376]] more imposing than [[H4481]] the others, [[H2273]] with eyes [[H5870]] and with  a mouth [[H6433]] that spoke [[H4449]] words of arrogance. [[H7260]]

### 21
As I [[H1934]] watched, [[H2370]] this [[H1797]] horn [[H7162]] was waging [[H5648]] war [[H7129]] against [[H5974]] the saints [[H6922]] and prevailing [[H3202]] against them, 

### 22
until [[H5705]] the Ancient [[H6268]] of Days [[H3118]] arrived [[H858]] and pronounced [[H3052]] judgment [[H1780]] in favor of the saints [[H6922]] of the Most High, [[H5946]] and the time [[H2166]] came [[H4291]] for [them] [[H6922]] to possess [[H2631]] the kingdom. [[H4437]]

### 23
This is what [[H3652]] he said: [[H560]] ‘The fourth [[H7244]] beast is [[H2423]] a fourth [[H7244]] kingdom [[H4437]] that will appear [[H1934]] on the earth, [[H772]] different [[H8133]] from [[H4481]] all [[H3606]] the other kingdoms, [[H4437]] and it will devour [[H399]] the whole [[H3606]] earth, [[H772]] trample it down, [[H1759]] and crush it. [[H1855]]

### 24
And the ten [[H6236]] horns [[H7162]] [are] ten [[H6236]] kings [[H4430]] who will rise [[H6966]] from [[H4481]] this kingdom. [[H4437]] After them [[H311]] another [king], [[H321]] different [[H8133]] from [[H4481]] the earlier [ones], [[H6933]] will rise [[H6966]] and subdue [[H8214]] three [[H8532]] kings. [[H4430]]

### 25
He will speak out [[H4449]] against [[H6655]] the Most High [[H5943]] and oppress [[H1080]] the saints [[H6922]] of the Most High, [[H5946]] intending [[H5452]] to change [[H8133]] the set times [[H2166]] and laws, [[H1882]] and [the saints] will be given [[H3052]] into his hand [[H3028]] for [[H5705]] a time, [[H5732]] and times, [[H5732]] and half [[H6387]] a time. [[H5732]]

### 26
But the court [[H1780]] will convene, [[H3488]] and his dominion [[H7985]] will be taken away [[H5709]] and completely destroyed [[H8046]] forever. [[H5705]]

### 27
Then the sovereignty, [[H4437]] dominion, [[H7985]] and greatness [[H7238]] of [[H1768]] the kingdoms [[H4437]] under [[H8460]] all [[H3606]] of heaven [[H8065]] will be given [[H3052]] to the people, [[H5972]] the saints [[H6922]] of the Most High. [[H5946]] His kingdom [[H4437]] will be an everlasting [[H5957]] kingdom, [[H4437]] and all [[H3606]] rulers [[H7985]] will serve [[H6399]] and obey Him.’ [[H8086]]

### 28
Thus [[H3542]] ends [[H5491]] the matter. [[H4406]] As for me, [[H576]] Daniel, [[H1841]] my thoughts [[H7476]] troubled me [[H927]] greatly, [[H7690]] and my face [[H2122]] turned pale. [[H8133]] But I kept [[H5202]] the matter [[H4406]] to myself.” [[H3821]]
