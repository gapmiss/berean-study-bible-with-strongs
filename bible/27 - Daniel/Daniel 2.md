### 1
In the second [[H8147]] year [[H8141]] of his [[H5019]] reign, [[H4438]] Nebuchadnezzar [[H5019]] had dreams [[H2492]] that troubled [[H6470]] his spirit, [[H7307]] and sleep [[H8142]] deserted [[H1961]] him. [[H5921]]

### 2
So the king [[H4428]] gave orders [[H559]] to summon [[H7121]] the magicians, [[H825]] enchanters, [[H2748]] sorcerers, [[H3784]] and astrologers [[H3778]] to explain [[H5046]] his dreams. [[H2472]] When they came [[H935]] and stood [[H5975]] before [[H6440]] the king, [[H4428]]

### 3
he [[H4428]] said to them, [[H559]] “I have had a dream, [[H2472]] and my spirit [[H7307]] is anxious [[H6470]] to understand [[H3045]] it.” [[H2472]]

### 4
Then the astrologers [[H3778]] answered [[H1696]] the king [[H4428]] in Aramaic, [[H762]] “O king, [[H4430]] may you live [[H2418]] forever! [[H5957]] Tell [[H560]] your servants [[H5649]] the dream, [[H2493]] and we will give [[H2324]] the interpretation.” [[H6591]]

### 5
The king [[H4430]] replied [[H6032]] to the astrologers, [[H3779]] “My word [[H4406]] is final: [[H230]] If [[H2006]] you do not [[H3809]] tell me [[H3046]] the dream [[H2493]] and its interpretation, [[H6591]] you will be cut [[H5648]] into pieces [[H1917]] and your houses [[H1005]] will be reduced [[H7761]] to rubble. [[H5122]]

### 6
But if [[H2006]] you tell me [[H2324]] the dream [[H2493]] and its interpretation, [[H6591]] you will receive [[H6902]] from [[H4481]] me [[H6925]] gifts [[H4978]] and rewards [[H5023]] and great [[H7690]] honor. [[H3367]] So [[H2006]] tell me [[H2324]] the dream [[H2493]] and its interpretation.” [[H6591]]

### 7
They answered [[H6032]] a second time, [[H8579]] “Let the king [[H4430]] tell [[H560]] the dream [[H2493]] to his servants, [[H5649]] and we will give [[H2324]] the interpretation.” [[H6591]]

### 8
The king [[H4430]] replied, [[H6032]] “I [[H576]] know [[H3046]] for [[H4481]] sure [[H3330]] you [[H608]] are stalling [[H2084]] for time, [[H5732]] because [[H6903]] you see [[H2370]] that [[H1768]] my [[H4481]] word [[H4406]] is final. [[H230]]

### 9
If [[H2006]] you do not [[H3809]] tell [[H3046]] me the dream, [[H2493]] [there] is [[H1932]] [only] one [[H2298]] decree for you. [[H1882]] You have conspired [[H2164]] to speak [[H560]] before me [[H6925]] FALSE [[H3538]] and fraudulent [[H7844]] words, [[H4406]] hoping [[H5705]] the situation [[H5732]] will change. [[H8133]] Therefore [[H2006]] tell [[H560]] me  the dream, [[H2493]] and I will know [[H3046]] that [[H1768]] you can give me [[H2324]] its interpretation. [[H6591]]

### 10
The astrologers [[H3779]] answered [[H6032]] the king, [[H4430]] “No [[H3809]] one [[H5922]] on earth [[H3007]] can [[H3202]] do [[H2324]] what the king [[H4430]] requests! [[H4406]] No [[H3809]] king, [[H4430]] however great [[H7229]] and powerful, [[H7990]] has ever asked [[H7593]] anything [[H4406]] like this [[H1836]] of any [[H3606]] magician, [[H826]] enchanter, [[H2749]] or astrologer. [[H3779]]

### 11
What [[H1768]] the king [[H4430]] requests [[H7593]] is so difficult [[H3358]] that no [[H3809]] one [[H321]] can tell it [[H2324]] to [[H6925]] him [[H4430]] except [[H3861]] the gods, [[H426]] whose [[H1768]] dwelling [[H4070]] is [[H383]] not [[H3809]] with [[H5974]] mortals.” [[H1321]]

### 12
This [response] made [[H6903]] the king [[H4430]] so [[H7690]] angry [[H1149]] and furious [[H7108]] that he gave orders [[H560]] to destroy [[H7]] all [[H3606]] the wise men [[H2445]] of Babylon. [[H895]]

### 13
So the decree [[H1882]] went out [[H5312]] that the wise men [[H2445]] were to be executed, [[H6992]] and men went to look for [[H1156]] Daniel [[H1841]] and his friends [[H2269]] to execute them. [[H6992]]

### 14
When [[H116]] Arioch, [[H746]] the commander [[H7229]] of the king’s [[H4430]] guard, [[H2877]] had gone out [[H5312]] to execute [[H6992]] the wise men [[H2445]] of Babylon, [[H895]] Daniel [[H1841]] replied [[H8421]] with discretion [[H5843]] and tact. [[H2942]]

### 15
“Why [[H5922]] is the decree [[H1882]] from [[H4481]] the king [[H4430]] so harsh?” [[H2685]] he asked. [[H6032]] At this time [[H116]] Arioch [[H746]] explained [[H3046]] the situation [[H4406]] to Daniel. [[H1841]]

### 16
So Daniel [[H1841]] went in [[H5954]] and asked [[H1156]] the king [[H4430]] to give [[H5415]] him  some time, [[H2166]] so that he could give [[H2324]] [him] [[H4430]] the interpretation. [[H6591]]

### 17
Then [[H116]] Daniel [[H1841]] returned [[H236]] to his house [[H1005]] and explained [[H3046]] the matter [[H4406]] to his friends [[H2269]] Hananiah, [[H2608]] Mishael, [[H4333]] and Azariah, [[H5839]]

### 18
urging them to plead [[H1156]] for mercy [[H7359]] from [[H6925]] the God [[H426]] of heaven [[H8065]] concerning [[H5922]] this [[H1836]] mystery, [[H7328]] so that [[H1768]] Daniel [[H1841]] and his friends [[H2269]] would not [[H3809]] be killed [[H7]] with [[H5974]] the rest [[H7606]] of the wise [men] [[H2445]] of Babylon. [[H895]]

### 19
During [[H116]] the night, [[H3916]] the mystery [[H7328]] was revealed [[H1541]] to Daniel [[H1841]] in a vision, [[H2376]] and [he] [[H1841]] blessed [[H1289]] the God [[H426]] of heaven [[H8065]]

### 20
and declared: [[H560]] “Blessed [[H1289]] be [[H1934]] the name [[H8036]] of [[H1768]] God [[H426]] forever [[H5957]] and [[H5705]] ever, [[H5957]] for [[H1768]] wisdom [[H2452]] and power [[H1370]] belong to Him. 

### 21
He [[H1932]] changes [[H8133]] the times [[H5732]] and seasons; [[H2166]] He removes [[H5709]] kings [[H4430]] and establishes [[H6966]] [them]. [[H4430]] He gives [[H3052]] wisdom [[H2452]] to the wise [[H2445]] and knowledge [[H4486]] to the discerning. [[H3046]]

### 22
He [[H1932]] reveals [[H1541]] the deep [[H5994]] and hidden things; [[H5642]] He knows [[H3046]] what [[H4101]] lies in darkness, [[H2816]] and light [[H5094]] dwells [[H8271]] with Him. [[H5974]]

### 23
To You,  O God [[H426]] of my fathers, [[H2]] I [[H576]] give thanks [[H3029]] and praise, [[H7624]] because [[H1768]] You have given me [[H3052]] wisdom [[H2452]] and power. [[H1370]] And now [[H3705]] You have made known to me [[H3046]] what [[H1768]] we have requested, [[H1156]] for [[H1768]] You have made known to us [[H3046]] the dream [[H4406]] of the king. [[H4430]]

### 24
Therefore [[H6903]] Daniel [[H1841]] went [[H5954]] to [[H5922]] Arioch, [[H746]] whom [[H1768]] the king [[H4430]] had appointed [[H4483]] to destroy [[H7]] the wise men [[H2445]] of Babylon, [[H895]] and said [[H560]] to him,  “Do not [[H409]] execute [[H7]] the wise men [[H2445]] of Babylon! [[H895]] Bring [[H5954]] me before [[H6925]] the king, [[H4430]] and I will give [[H2324]] him [[H4430]] the interpretation. [[H6591]]

### 25
Arioch [[H746]] hastily [[H927]] brought [[H5954]] Daniel [[H1841]] before [[H6925]] the king [[H4430]] and said [[H560]] to him,  “I have found [[H7912]] a man [[H1400]] among [[H4481]] the exiles [[H1123]] from Judah [[H3061]] who [[H1768]] will tell [[H3046]] the king [[H4430]] the interpretation.” [[H6591]]

### 26
The king [[H4430]] responded [[H6032]] to Daniel, [[H1841]] whose [[H1768]] name [[H8036]] was Belteshazzar, [[H1096]] “Are you able [[H3546]] to tell me [[H3046]] what [[H1768]] I saw [[H2370]] in the dream, [[H2493]] as well as its interpretation?” [[H6591]]

### 27
Daniel [[H1841]] answered [[H6032]] the king, [[H4430]] “No [[H3809]] wise man, [[H2445]] medium, [[H2749]] magician, [[H1505]] or diviner [[H826]] can [[H3202]] explain [[H2324]] to the king [[H4430]] the mystery [[H7328]] of which [[H1768]] [he] [[H4430]] inquires. [[H7593]]

### 28
But [[H1297]] there is [[H383]] a God [[H426]] in heaven [[H8065]] who reveals [[H1541]] mysteries, [[H7328]] and He has made known [[H3046]] to King [[H4430]] Nebuchadnezzar [[H5020]] what [[H4101]] will happen [[H1934]] in the latter [[H320]] days. [[H3118]] Your dream [[H2493]] and the visions [[H2376]] that came into your mind [[H7217]] as you lay on [[H5922]] your bed [[H4903]] were these: [[H1836]]

### 29
As you [[H607]] lay on [[H5922]] your bed, [[H4903]] O king, [[H4430]] your thoughts [[H7476]] turned [[H5559]] to [[H4101]] the future, [[H311]] and the Revealer [[H1541]] of Mysteries [[H7328]] has let you know [[H3046]] what [[H4101]] will happen. [[H1934]]

### 30
And to me [[H576]] this [[H1836]] mystery [[H7328]] has been revealed, [[H1541]] not [[H3809]] because [[H1768]] I have [[H383]] more wisdom [[H2452]] than [[H4481]] any man [[H3606]] alive, [[H2417]] but [[H3861]] in order that [[H5922]] the interpretation [[H6591]] might be made known [[H3046]] to the king, [[H4430]] and that you may understand [[H3046]] the thoughts [[H7476]] of your mind. [[H3825]]

### 31
As you, [[H607]] O king, [[H4430]] were watching, [[H2370]] a [[H2298]] great [[H7690]] statue [[H6755]] appeared. [[H431]] A great [[H7229]] and dazzling [[H2122]] statue [[H6755]] stood [[H6966]] before you, [[H6903]] and its form [[H7299]] [was] awesome. [[H1763]]

### 32
The head [[H7217]] of the statue [[H6755]] was pure [[H2869]] gold, [[H1722]] its chest [[H2306]] and arms [[H1872]] were silver, [[H3702]] its belly [[H4577]] and thighs [[H3410]] were bronze, [[H5174]]

### 33
its legs [[H8243]] were iron, [[H6523]] and its feet [[H7271]] were part [[H4481]] iron [[H6523]] and part [[H4480]] clay. [[H2635]]

### 34
While you were [[H1934]] watching, [[H2370]] a stone [[H69]] was cut out, [[H1505]] but not [[H3809]] by human hands. [[H3028]] It struck [[H4223]] the statue [[H6755]] on [[H5922]] its feet [[H7271]] of [[H1768]] iron [[H6523]] and clay, [[H2635]] and crushed [[H1855]] them. [[H1994]]

### 35
Then [[H116]] the iron, [[H6523]] clay, [[H2635]] bronze, [[H5174]] silver, [[H3702]] and gold [[H1722]] were shattered [[H1855]] and became [[H1934]] like chaff [[H5784]] on [[H4481]] the threshing floor [[H147]] in summer. [[H7007]] The wind [[H7308]] carried them [[H1994]] away, [[H5376]] and not [[H3809]] a trace [[H870]] of them  could be found. [[H7912]] But the stone [[H69]] that [[H1768]] had struck [[H4223]] the statue [[H6755]] became [[H1934]] a great [[H7229]] mountain [[H2906]] and filled [[H4391]] the whole [[H3606]] earth. [[H772]]

### 36
This [[H1836]] was the dream; [[H2493]] now we will tell [[H560]] the king [[H4430]] its interpretation. [[H6591]]

### 37
You, [[H607]] O king, [[H4430]] are the king [[H4430]] of kings, [[H4430]] to whom [[H1768]] the God [[H426]] of heaven [[H8065]] has given [[H3052]] sovereignty, [[H4437]] power, [[H2632]] strength, [[H8632]] and glory. [[H3367]]

### 38
Wherever [[H3606]] the sons [[H1123]] of men [[H606]] or beasts [[H2423]] of the field [[H1251]] or birds [[H5776]] of the air [[H8065]] dwell, [[H1753]] He has given [them] [[H3052]] into your hand [[H3028]] and has made you ruler [[H7981]] over them all. [[H3606]] You [are] [[H607]] that [[H607]] head [[H7217]] of [[H1768]] gold. [[H1722]]

### 39
But after you, [[H870]] there will arise [[H6966]] another [[H317]] kingdom, [[H4437]] inferior [[H772]] to yours. [[H4481]] Next, a [[H317]] third [[H8523]] kingdom, [[H4437]] one of [[H1768]] bronze, [[H5174]] will rule [[H7981]] the whole [[H3606]] earth. [[H772]]

### 40
Finally, there will be [[H1934]] a fourth [[H7244]] kingdom [[H4437]] as strong [[H8624]] as iron; [[H6523]] for [[H6903]] iron [[H6523]] shatters [[H1855]] and crushes [[H2827]] all things, [[H3606]] and like iron [[H6523]] that [[H1768]] crushes [[H7490]] all things, [[H3606]] it will shatter [[H1855]] and crush [[H7490]] all [[H3606]] the others. [[H459]]

### 41
And just as [[H1768]] you saw that [[H2370]] the feet [[H7271]] and toes [[H677]] were made partly of [[H4481]] fired clay [[H2635]] and partly of [[H4481]] iron, [[H6523]] so this will be [[H1934]] a divided [[H6386]] kingdom, [[H4437]] yet [[H6903]] some of [[H1768]] the strength [[H5326]] of [[H1768]] iron [[H6523]] will be in it— [[H1934]] just as you saw [[H2370]] the iron [[H6523]] mixed [[H6151]] with clay. [[H2635]]

### 42
And as the toes [[H677]] of the feet [[H7271]] were partly [[H4481]] iron [[H6523]] and partly [[H4481]] clay, [[H2635]] so this kingdom [[H4437]] will be [[H1934]] partly [[H7118]] strong [[H8624]] and partly [[H4481]] brittle. [[H8406]]

### 43
As you saw [[H2370]] the iron [[H6523]] mixed [[H6151]] with clay, [[H2635]] so the peoples [[H2234]] will mix with one another, [[H6151]] but will not [[H3809]] hold together [[H1693]] any more than [[H1768]] iron [[H6523]] mixes [[H6151]] with [[H5974]] clay. [[H2635]]

### 44
In the days [[H3118]] of those [[H581]] kings, [[H4430]] the God [[H426]] of heaven [[H8065]] will set up [[H6966]] a kingdom [[H4437]] that [[H1768]] will never [[H5957]] be destroyed, [[H2255]] and this kingdom [[H4437]] will not [[H3809]] be left [[H7662]] to another [[H321]] people. [[H5972]] It will shatter [[H1855]] all [[H3606]] these [[H459]] kingdoms [[H4437]] and bring them to an end, [[H5487]] but will itself stand [[H6966]] forever. [[H5957]]

### 45
And just as [[H3606]] you saw [[H2370]] a stone [[H69]] cut out [[H1505]] of the mountain [[H2906]] without [[H3809]] human hands, [[H3028]] and it shattered [[H1855]] the iron, [[H6523]] bronze, [[H5174]] clay, [[H2635]] silver, [[H3702]] and gold, [[H1722]] so the great [[H7229]] God [[H426]] has told [[H3046]] the king [[H4430]] what [[H4101]] will happen [[H1934]] in the future. [[H311]] The dream [[H2493]] is true, [[H3330]] and its interpretation [[H6591]] is trustworthy. [[H540]]

### 46
At this, [[H116]] King [[H4430]] Nebuchadnezzar [[H5020]] fell [[H5308]] on [[H5922]] his face, [[H600]] paid homage [[H5457]] to Daniel, [[H1841]] and ordered [[H560]] that an offering [[H4504]] of incense [[H5208]] be presented [[H5260]] to him. 

### 47
The king [[H4430]] said [[H6032]] to Daniel, [[H1841]] “Your God [[H426]] is truly [[H4481]] the God [[H426]] of gods [[H426]] and Lord [[H4756]] of kings, [[H4430]] a revealer [[H1541]] of mysteries, [[H7328]] since [[H1768]] you were able [[H3202]] to reveal [[H1541]] this [[H1836]] mystery.” [[H7328]]

### 48
Then [[H116]] the king [[H4430]] promoted [[H7236]] Daniel [[H1841]] and gave [[H3052]] him many [[H7690]] generous [[H7229]] gifts. [[H4978]] He made him ruler [[H7981]] over [[H5922]] the entire [[H3606]] province [[H4083]] of Babylon [[H895]] and administrator [[H5460]] over [[H5922]] all [[H3606]] the wise men [[H2445]] of Babylon. [[H895]]

### 49
And at Daniel’s [[H1841]] request, [[H1156]] the king [[H4430]] appointed [[H4483]] Shadrach, [[H7715]] Meshach, [[H4336]] and Abednego [[H5665]] to [[H5922]] manage [[H5673]] the province [[H4083]] of Babylon, [[H895]] while Daniel [[H1841]] remained at the king’s [[H4430]] court. [[H8651]]
