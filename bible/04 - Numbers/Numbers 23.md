### 1
Then Balaam [[H1109]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Balak, [[H1111]] “Build [[H1129]] me  seven [[H7651]] altars [[H4196]] here, [[H2088]] and prepare [[H3559]] for me  seven [[H7651]] bulls [[H6499]] and seven [[H7651]] rams.” [[H352]]

### 2
So Balak [[H1111]] did [[H6213]] as [[H834]] Balaam [[H1109]] had directed, [[H1696]] and Balak [[H1111]] and Balaam [[H1109]] offered [[H5927]] a bull [[H6499]] and a ram [[H352]] on each altar. [[H4196]]

### 3
“Stay [[H3320]] here by [[H5921]] your burnt offering [[H5930]] while I am gone,” [[H1980]] Balaam [[H1109]] said [[H559]] to Balak. [[H1111]] “Perhaps [[H194]] the LORD [[H3068]] will meet with me. [[H7125]] And whatever [[H4100]] He reveals to me, [[H7200]] I will tell [[H5046]] you.”  So [Balaam] went off [[H1980]] to a barren height, [[H8205]]

### 4
and God [[H430]] met [[H7136]] with [[H413]] him. [[H1109]] “I have set up [[H6186]] seven [[H7651]] altars,” [[H4196]] Balaam said, [[H559]] “and on each altar [[H4196]] I have offered [[H5927]] a bull [[H6499]] and a ram.” [[H352]]

### 5
Then the LORD [[H3068]] put [[H7760]] a message [[H1697]] in Balaam’s [[H1109]] mouth, [[H6310]] saying, [[H559]] “Return [[H7725]] to [[H413]] Balak [[H1111]] and [[H3541]] give him this message.” [[H1696]]

### 6
So he returned [[H7725]] to Balak, [[H413]] who [[H1931]] was standing [[H5324]] there [[H2009]] beside [[H5921]] his burnt offering, [[H5930]] with all [[H3605]] the princes [[H8269]] of Moab. [[H4124]]

### 7
And Balaam lifted up [[H5375]] an oracle, [[H4912]] saying: [[H559]] “Balak [[H1111]] brought [[H5148]] me from [[H4480]] Aram, [[H758]] the king [[H4428]] of Moab [[H4124]] from the mountains [[H2042]] of the east. [[H6924]] ‘Come,’ he said, [[H1980]] ‘put a curse [[H779]] on Jacob [[H3290]] for me;  come, [[H1980]] denounce [[H2194]] Israel!’ [[H3478]]

### 8
How [[H4100]] can I curse [what] [[H6895]] God [[H410]] has not [[H3808]] cursed? [[H5344]] How [[H4100]] can I denounce [what] [[H2194]] the LORD [[H3068]] has not [[H3808]] denounced? [[H2194]]

### 9
For [[H3588]] I see them [[H7200]] from atop [[H7218]] the rocky cliffs, [[H6697]] and I watch them [[H7789]] from the hills. [[H1389]] Behold, [[H2005]] a people [[H5971]] dwelling [[H7931]] apart, [[H910]] [who] will not [[H3808]] reckon themselves [[H2803]] among the nations. [[H1471]]

### 10
Who [[H4310]] can count [[H4487]] the dust [[H6083]] of Jacob [[H3290]] or number [[H4557]] [even] a fourth [[H7255]] of Israel? [[H3478]] Let me [[H5315]] die [[H4191]] the death [[H4194]] of the righteous; [[H3477]] let my end [[H319]] be [[H1961]] like theirs!” [[H3644]]

### 11
“What [[H4100]] have you done to me?” [[H6213]] Balak [[H1111]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Balaam. [[H1109]] “I brought [[H3947]] you to curse [[H6895]] my enemies, [[H341]] and behold, [[H2009]] you have only blessed [[H1288]] them!” [[H1288]]

### 12
But [Balaam] replied, [[H6030]] “Should I not [[H3808]] speak [[H1696]] exactly what [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] puts [[H7760]] in my mouth?” [[H6310]]

### 13
Then Balak [[H1111]] said [[H559]] to him, [[H413]] “Please come [[H1980]] with [[H854]] me to [[H413]] another [[H312]] place [[H4725]] where [[H834]] you can see them. [[H7200]] You will only [[H657]] see [[H7200]] the outskirts of their camp— [[H7097]] not [[H3808]] all of them. [[H3605]] And from there, [[H8033]] curse them for me.” [[H6895]]

### 14
So Balak took him [[H3947]] to the field [[H7704]] of Zophim, [[H6839]] to the [[H413]] top [[H7218]] of Pisgah, [[H6449]] where he built [[H1129]] seven [[H7651]] altars [[H4196]] and offered [[H5927]] a bull [[H6499]] and a ram [[H352]] on each altar. [[H4196]]

### 15
Balaam said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Balak, [[H1111]] “Stay [[H3320]] here [[H3541]] beside [[H5921]] your burnt offering [[H5930]] while I [[H595]] meet [the LORD] [[H7136]] over there.” [[H3541]]

### 16
And the LORD [[H3068]] met [[H7136]] with [[H413]] Balaam [[H1109]] and put [[H7760]] a message [[H1697]] in his mouth, [[H6310]] saying, [[H559]] “Return [[H7725]] to [[H413]] Balak [[H1111]] and speak [[H1696]] what I tell you.” [[H3541]]

### 17
So he returned [[H935]] to Balak, [[H413]] who was standing [[H5324]] there [[H2009]] by [[H5921]] his burnt offering [[H5930]] with [[H854]] the princes [[H8269]] of Moab. [[H4124]] “What [[H4100]] did the LORD [[H3068]] say?” [[H1696]] Balak [[H1111]] asked. [[H559]]

### 18
Then Balaam lifted up [[H5375]] an oracle, [[H4912]] saying: [[H559]] “Arise, [[H6965]] O Balak, [[H1111]] and listen; [[H8085]] give [[H238]] ear to me, [[H5704]] O son [[H1121]] of Zippor. [[H6834]]

### 19
God [[H410]] is not [[H3808]] a man, [[H376]] that He should lie, [[H3576]] or a son [[H1121]] of man, [[H120]] that He should change His mind. [[H5162]] Does He [[H1931]] speak [[H559]] and not [[H3808]] act? [[H6213]] Does He promise [[H1696]] and not [[H3808]] fulfill? [[H6965]]

### 20
I have indeed [[H2009]] received [[H3947]] a command to bless; [[H1288]] He has blessed, [[H1288]] and I cannot [[H3808]] change it. [[H7725]]

### 21
He considers [[H5027]] no [[H3808]] disaster [[H205]] for Jacob; [[H3290]] He sees [[H7200]] no [[H3808]] trouble [[H5999]] for Israel. [[H3478]] The LORD [[H3068]] their God [[H430]] is with them, [[H5973]] and the shout [[H8643]] of the King [[H4428]] is among them. 

### 22
God [[H410]] brought them out [[H3318]] of Egypt [[H4714]] with strength [[H8443]] like a wild ox. [[H7214]]

### 23
For [[H3588]] there is no [[H3808]] spell [[H5173]] against Jacob [[H3290]] and no [[H3808]] divination [[H7081]] against Israel. [[H3478]] It will now [[H6256]] be said [[H559]] of Jacob [[H3290]] and Israel, [[H3478]] ‘What [[H4100]] great things God [[H410]] has done!’ [[H6466]]

### 24
Behold, [[H2005]] the people [[H5971]] rise [[H6965]] like a lioness; [[H3833]] they rouse themselves [[H5375]] like a lion, [[H738]] not [[H3808]] resting [[H7901]] until [[H5704]] they devour [[H398]] their prey [[H2964]] and drink [[H8354]] the blood [[H1818]] of the slain.” [[H2491]]

### 25
Then Balak [[H1111]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Balaam, [[H1109]] “Neither [[H1571]] curse [[H5344]] them at all [[H6895]] nor [[H3808]] bless [[H1288]] them at all!” [[H1288]]

### 26
But Balaam [[H1109]] replied, [[H6030]] “Did I not [[H3808]] tell you that [[H1696]] whatever [[H3605]] the LORD [[H3068]] says, [[H1696]] I must do?” [[H6213]]

### 27
“Please [[H4994]] come,” [[H1980]] said [[H559]] Balak, [[H1111]] “I will take [[H3947]] you to [[H413]] another [[H312]] place. [[H4725]] Perhaps [[H194]] it will please [[H3477]] God [[H430]] that you curse them [[H6895]] for me  from there.” [[H8033]]

### 28
And Balak [[H1111]] took [[H3947]] Balaam [[H1109]] to the top [[H7218]] of Peor, [[H6465]] which overlooks [[H8259]] the wasteland. [[H3452]]

### 29
“Build [[H1129]] me seven [[H7651]] altars [[H4196]] here,” [[H2088]] Balaam [[H1109]] said, [[H559]] “and prepare [[H3559]] for me  seven [[H7651]] bulls [[H6499]] and seven [[H7651]] rams.” [[H352]]

### 30
So Balak [[H1111]] did [[H6213]] as [[H834]] Balaam [[H1109]] had instructed, [[H559]] and he offered [[H5927]] a bull [[H6499]] and a ram [[H352]] on each altar. [[H4196]]
