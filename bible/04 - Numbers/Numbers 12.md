### 1
Then Miriam [[H4813]] and Aaron [[H175]] criticized [[H1696]] Moses [[H4872]] because of [[H5921]] the Cushite [[H3569]] woman [[H802]] he had married, [[H3947]] for [[H3588]] he had taken [[H3947]] a Cushite [[H3569]] wife. [[H802]]

### 2
“Does the LORD [[H3068]] speak [[H1696]] only [[H7535]] through Moses?” [[H4872]] they said. [[H559]] “Does He not [[H3808]] also [[H1571]] speak [[H1696]] through us?”  And the LORD [[H3068]] heard this. [[H8085]]

### 3
Now Moses [[H4872]] was a very [[H3966]] humble [[H6035]] man, [[H376]] more so than any [[H3605]] man [[H120]] on [[H5921]] the face [[H6440]] of the earth. [[H127]]

### 4
And suddenly [[H6597]] the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] Aaron, [[H175]] and Miriam, [[H4813]] “You three, [[H7969]] come out [[H3318]] to [[H413]] the Tent [[H168]] of Meeting.” [[H4150]] So the three [[H7969]] went out, [[H3318]]

### 5
and the LORD [[H3068]] came down [[H3381]] in a pillar [[H5982]] of cloud, [[H6051]] stood [[H5975]] at the entrance [[H6607]] to the Tent, [[H168]] and summoned [[H7121]] Aaron [[H175]] and Miriam. [[H4813]] When both [[H8147]] of them had stepped forward, [[H3318]]

### 6
He said, [[H559]] “Hear [[H8085]] now [[H4994]] My words: [[H1697]] If [[H518]] there is [[H1961]] a prophet [among you], [[H5030]] [I], the LORD, [[H3068]] will reveal Myself [[H3045]] to him [[H413]] in a vision, [[H4759]] I will speak [[H1696]] to him  in a dream; [[H2472]]

### 7
not [[H3808]] so [[H3651]] with My servant [[H5650]] Moses; [[H4872]] he [[H1931]] is faithful [[H539]] in all [[H3605]] My house. [[H1004]]

### 8
I speak [[H1696]] with him  face [[H6310]] to [[H413]] face, [[H6310]] clearly [[H4758]] and not [[H3808]] in riddles; [[H2420]] he sees [[H5027]] the form [[H8544]] of the LORD. [[H3068]] Why then [[H4069]] were you unafraid [[H3372]] to speak [[H1696]] against My servant [[H5650]] Moses?” [[H4872]]

### 9
So the anger [[H639]] of the LORD [[H3069]] burned [[H2734]] against them,  and He departed. [[H1980]]

### 10
As the cloud [[H6051]] lifted [[H5493]] from above [[H5921]] the Tent, [[H168]] suddenly [[H2009]] Miriam [[H4813]] [became] leprous, [[H6879]] [white] as snow. [[H7950]] Aaron [[H175]] turned [[H6437]] toward [[H413]] her, [[H4813]] saw that [[H2009]] she [was] leprous, [[H6879]]

### 11
and said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] “My lord, [[H113]] please [[H4994]] do not [[H408]] hold [[H7896]] against us [[H5921]] this sin [[H2403]] we have so foolishly [[H2973]] committed. [[H2398]]

### 12
Please [[H4994]] do not [[H408]] let her be [[H1961]] like a stillborn infant [[H4191]] whose [[H834]] flesh [[H1320]] is half [[H2677]] consumed [[H398]] when he comes out [[H3318]] of his mother’s [[H517]] womb.” [[H7358]]

### 13
So Moses [[H4872]] cried out [[H6817]] to [[H413]] the LORD, [[H3068]] “O God, [[H410]] please [[H4994]] heal her!” [[H7495]]

### 14
But the LORD [[H3068]] answered [[H559]] Moses, [[H4872]] “If her father [[H1]] had but [[H3417]] spit [[H3417]] in her face, [[H6440]] would she not [[H3808]] have been in disgrace [[H3637]] for seven [[H7651]] days? [[H3117]] Let her be confined [[H5462]] outside [[H2351]] the camp [[H4264]] for seven [[H7651]] days; [[H3117]] after that [[H310]] she may be brought back in.” [[H622]]

### 15
So Miriam [[H4813]] was confined [[H5462]] outside [[H2351]] the camp [[H4264]] for seven [[H7651]] days, [[H3117]] and the people [[H5971]] did not [[H3808]] move on [[H5265]] until [[H5704]] [she] [[H4813]] was brought in again. [[H622]]

### 16
After that, [[H310]] the people [[H5971]] set out [[H5265]] from Hazeroth [[H2698]] and camped [[H2583]] in the Wilderness [[H4057]] of Paran. [[H6290]]
