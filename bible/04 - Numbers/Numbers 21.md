### 1
When the Canaanite [[H3669]] king [[H4428]] of Arad, [[H6166]] who lived [[H3427]] in the Negev, [[H5045]] heard [[H8085]] that [[H3588]] Israel [[H3478]] was coming [[H935]] along the road [[H1870]] to Atharim, [[H871]] he attacked [[H3898]] Israel [[H3478]] and captured [[H7617]] some [[H4480]] prisoners. [[H7628]]

### 2
So Israel [[H3478]] made [[H5087]] a vow [[H5088]] to the LORD: [[H3068]] “If [[H518]] You will deliver [[H5414]] this [[H2088]] people [[H5971]] into our hands, [[H3027]] we will completely destroy [[H2763]] their cities.” [[H5892]]

### 3
And the LORD [[H3068]] heard [[H8085]] Israel’s [[H3478]] plea [[H6963]] and delivered up [[H5414]] the Canaanites. [[H3669]] Israel completely destroyed [[H2763]] them [[H853]] and their cities; [[H5892]] so they named [[H7121]] the place [[H4725]] Hormah. [[H2767]]

### 4
Then they set out [[H5265]] from Mount [[H2022]] Hor [[H2023]] along the route [[H1870]] to the Red [[H5488]] Sea, [[H3220]] in order to bypass [[H5437]] the land [[H776]] of Edom. [[H123]] But the people [[H5971]] grew impatient [[H7114]] on the journey [[H1870]]

### 5
and spoke [[H1696]] against God [[H430]] and against Moses: [[H4872]] “Why [[H4100]] have you led us up [[H5927]] out of Egypt [[H4714]] to die [[H4191]] in the wilderness? [[H4057]] There is no [[H369]] bread [[H3899]] or water, [[H4325]] and we [[H5315]] detest [[H6973]] this wretched [[H7052]] food!” [[H3899]]

### 6
So the LORD [[H3068]] sent [[H7971]] poisonous snakes [[H5175]] among the people, [[H5971]] and many [[H7227]] of the Israelites [[H3478]] were bitten [[H5391]] and died. [[H4191]]

### 7
Then the people [[H5971]] came [[H935]] to [[H413]] Moses [[H4872]] and said, [[H559]] “We have sinned [[H2398]] by [[H3588]] speaking [[H1696]] against the LORD [[H3068]] and against you.  Intercede [[H6419]] with [[H413]] the LORD [[H3068]] to take the snakes [[H5175]] away [[H5493]] from us.” [[H5921]] So Moses [[H4872]] interceded [[H6419]] for [[H1157]] the people. [[H5971]]

### 8
Then the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] “Make [[H6213]] a snake [[H8314]] and mount [[H7760]] it [[H853]] on [[H5921]] a pole. [[H5251]] When anyone [[H3605]] who is bitten [[H5391]] looks at it, [[H7200]] he will live.” [[H2425]]

### 9
So Moses [[H4872]] made [[H6213]] a bronze [[H5178]] snake [[H5175]] and mounted [[H7760]] it on [[H5921]] a pole. [[H5251]] If [[H518]] anyone who [[H376]] was bitten [[H5391]] looked [[H5027]] at [[H413]] the bronze [[H5178]] serpent, [[H5175]] he would recover. [[H2425]]

### 10
Then the Israelites [[H1121]] set out [[H5265]] and camped [[H2583]] at Oboth. [[H88]]

### 11
They journeyed [[H5265]] from Oboth [[H88]] and camped [[H2583]] at Iye-abarim [[H5863]] in the wilderness [[H4057]] opposite [[H5921]] Moab [[H4124]] to the east. [[H4217]]

### 12
From there [[H8033]] they set [[H5265]] out and camped [[H2583]] at Zered [[H2218]] Valley. [[H5158]]

### 13
From there [[H8033]] they moved on [[H5265]] and camped [[H2583]] on the other side [[H5676]] of the Arnon, [[H769]] in the wilderness [[H4057]] that extends [[H3318]] into the Amorite [[H567]] territory. [[H1366]] Now [[H3588]] the Arnon [[H769]] is the border [[H1366]] between [[H996]] the Moabites [[H4124]] and [[H996]] the Amorites. [[H567]]

### 14
Therefore [[H5921]] it is stated [[H559]] in the Book [[H5612]] of the Wars [[H4421]] of the LORD: [[H3068]] “Waheb [[H2052]] in Suphah [[H5492]] and the wadis [[H5158]] of the Arnon, [[H769]]

### 15
even the slopes [[H793]] of the wadis [[H5158]] that [[H834]] extend [[H5186]] to the site [[H3427]] of Ar [[H6144]] and lie [[H8172]] along the border [[H1366]] of Moab.” [[H4124]]

### 16
From there [[H8033]] [they went on] to Beer, [[H876]] the well [[H875]] where [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H559]] to Moses, [[H4872]] “Gather [[H622]] the people [[H5971]] so that I may give [[H5414]] them water.” [[H4325]]

### 17
Then [[H227]] Israel [[H3478]] sang [[H7891]] this [[H2063]] song: [[H7892]] “Spring up, [[H5927]] O well, [[H875]] all of you sing [[H6030]] to it! 

### 18
The princes [[H8269]] dug [[H2658]] the well; [[H875]] the nobles [[H5081]] of the people [[H5971]] hollowed it out [[H3738]] with their scepters [[H2710]] and with their staffs.” [[H4938]] From the wilderness [the Israelites went on] [[H4057]] to Mattanah, [[H4980]]

### 19
and from Mattanah [[H4980]] to Nahaliel, [[H5160]] and from Nahaliel [[H5160]] to Bamoth, [[H1120]]

### 20
and from Bamoth [[H1120]] to the valley [[H1516]] [in] [[H7704]] Moab [[H4124]] where the top [[H7218]] of Pisgah [[H6449]] overlooks [[H8259]] the wasteland. [[H3452]]

### 21
Then Israel [[H3478]] sent [[H7971]] messengers [[H4397]] to [[H413]] Sihon [[H5511]] king [[H4428]] of the Amorites, [[H567]] saying, [[H559]]

### 22
“Let us pass [[H5674]] through your land. [[H776]] We will not [[H3808]] cut through [[H5186]] any field [[H7704]] or vineyard, [[H3754]] [or] [[H3808]] drink [[H8354]] water [[H4325]] from any well. [[H875]] We will stay on [[H1980]] the King’s [[H4428]] Highway [[H1870]] until [[H5704]] we have passed through [[H5674]] your territory.” [[H1366]]

### 23
But Sihon [[H5511]] would not [[H3808]] let [[H5414]] Israel [[H3478]] pass [[H5674]] through his territory. [[H1366]] Instead, he [[H5511]] gathered [[H622]] his whole [[H3605]] army [[H5971]] and went out [[H3318]] to confront [[H7125]] Israel [[H3478]] in the wilderness. [[H4057]] When he came [[H935]] to Jahaz, [[H3096]] he fought [[H3898]] against Israel. [[H3478]]

### 24
And Israel [[H3478]] put him [[H5221]] to the sword [[H2719]] and took possession of [[H3423]] his land, [[H776]] from the Arnon [[H769]] to [[H5704]] the Jabbok— [[H2999]] but only up to [[H5704]] the border [[H1366]] of the Ammonites, [[H1121]] because [[H3588]] it was fortified. [[H5794]]

### 25
Israel [[H3478]] captured [[H3947]] all [[H3605]] the cities [[H5892]] of the Amorites [[H567]] and occupied [[H3427]] [them], [[H3605]] including Heshbon [[H2809]] and all [[H3605]] its villages. [[H1323]]

### 26
Heshbon [[H2809]] was the city [[H5892]] of Sihon [[H5511]] king [[H4428]] of the Amorites, [[H567]] who [[H1931]] had fought [[H3898]] against the former [[H7223]] king [[H4428]] of Moab [[H4124]] and taken [[H3947]] all [[H3605]] his land [[H776]] as [[H5704]] far as the Arnon. [[H769]]

### 27
That is why [[H5921]] the poets [[H4911]] say: [[H559]] “Come [[H935]] to Heshbon, [[H2809]] let it be rebuilt; [[H1129]] let the city [[H5892]] of Sihon [[H5511]] be restored. [[H3559]]

### 28
For [[H3588]] a fire [[H784]] went out [[H3318]] from Heshbon, [[H2809]] a blaze [[H3852]] from the city [[H7151]] of Sihon. [[H5511]] It consumed [[H398]] Ar [[H6144]] of Moab, [[H4124]] the rulers [[H1167]] of Arnon’s [[H769]] heights. [[H1116]]

### 29
Woe to you, [[H188]] O Moab! [[H4124]] You are destroyed, [[H6]] O people [[H5971]] of Chemosh! [[H3645]] He gave up [[H5414]] his sons [[H1121]] as refugees, [[H6412]] and his daughters [[H1323]] into captivity [[H7628]] to Sihon [[H5511]] king [[H4428]] of the Amorites. [[H567]]

### 30
But we have overthrown them; [[H3384]] Heshbon [[H2809]] is destroyed [[H6]] as far as [[H5704]] Dibon. [[H1769]] We demolished them [[H8074]] as [[H5704]] far as Nophah, [[H5302]] which [[H834]] reaches to [[H5704]] Medeba.” [[H4311]]

### 31
So Israel [[H3478]] lived [[H3427]] in the land [[H776]] of the Amorites. [[H567]]

### 32
After Moses [[H4872]] had sent [[H7971]] spies [[H7270]] to Jazer, [[H3270]] Israel captured [[H3920]] its villages [[H1323]] and drove out [[H3423]] the Amorites [[H567]] who [[H834]] were there. [[H8033]]

### 33
Then they turned [[H6437]] and went up [[H5927]] the road [[H1870]] to Bashan, [[H1316]] and Og [[H5747]] king [[H4428]] of Bashan [[H1316]] marched out [[H3318]] against [[H7125]] them [[H1931]] with his whole [[H3605]] army [[H5971]] to do battle [[H4421]] at Edrei. [[H154]]

### 34
But the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] “Do not [[H408]] fear him, [[H3372]] for [[H3588]] I have handed him over [[H3027]] to you, [[H853]] with all [[H3605]] his people [[H5971]] and his land. [[H776]] Do [[H6213]] to him as [[H834]] you did [[H6213]] to Sihon [[H5511]] king [[H4428]] of the Amorites, [[H567]] who [[H834]] lived [[H3427]] in Heshbon. [[H2809]]

### 35
So they struck down [Og], [[H5221]] along with [[H853]] his sons [[H1121]] and his whole [[H3605]] army, [[H5971]] until [[H5704]] no [[H1115]] remnant was left. [[H7604]] And they took possession of [[H3423]] his land. [[H776]]
