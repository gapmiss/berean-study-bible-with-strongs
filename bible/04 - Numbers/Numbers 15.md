###### 1
Then the LORD [[H3068]] instructed [[H1696]] Moses, [[H4872]]

###### 2
“Speak [[H1696]] to [[H413]] the Israelites [[H1121]] and tell them: [[H559]] After [[H3588]] you enter [[H935]] the land [[H776]] I [[H589]] am giving [[H5414]] you  to settle [[H4186]]

###### 3
and you present [[H6213]] an offering made by fire [[H801]] to the LORD [[H3068]] from [[H4480]] the herd [[H1241]] or [[H176]] flock [[H6629]] to produce [[H6213]] a pleasing [[H5207]] aroma [[H7381]] to the LORD— [[H3068]] either a burnt offering [[H5930]] or [[H176]] a sacrifice [[H2077]] to fulfill [[H6381]] a vow [[H5088]] or [[H176]] as a freewill [[H5071]] or [[H176]] festival offering— [[H4150]]

###### 4
then the one presenting [[H7126]] his offering [[H7133]] to the LORD [[H3068]] shall also present [[H7126]] a grain offering [[H4503]] of a tenth of an ephah [[H6241]] of fine flour [[H5560]] mixed [[H1101]] with a quarter [[H7243]] hin [[H1969]] of oil. [[H8081]]

###### 5
With [[H5921]] the burnt offering [[H5930]] or [[H176]] sacrifice [[H2077]] of each [[H259]] lamb, [[H3532]] prepare [[H6213]] a quarter [[H7243]] hin [[H1969]] of wine [[H3196]] as a drink offering. [[H5262]]

###### 6
With a ram [[H352]] you are to prepare [[H6213]] a grain offering [[H4503]] of two-tenths [of an ephah] [[H8147]] of fine flour [[H5560]] mixed [[H1101]] with a third [[H7992]] of a hin [[H1969]] of oil, [[H8081]]

###### 7
[and] [[H7126]] a third [[H7992]] of a hin [[H1969]] of wine [[H3196]] as a drink offering, [[H5262]] a pleasing [[H5207]] aroma [[H7381]] to the LORD. [[H3068]]

###### 8
When [[H3588]] you prepare [[H6213]] a young [[H1121]] bull [[H1241]] as a burnt offering [[H5930]] or [[H176]] sacrifice [[H2077]] to fulfill [[H6381]] a vow [[H5088]] or [[H176]] as a peace offering [[H8002]] to the LORD, [[H3068]]

###### 9
present [[H7126]] with [[H5921]] the bull [[H1241]] a grain offering [[H4503]] of three-tenths [of an ephah] [[H7969]] of fine flour [[H5560]] mixed [[H1101]] with half [[H2677]] a hin [[H1969]] of oil. [[H8081]]

###### 10
Also present [[H7126]] half [[H2677]] a hin [[H1969]] of wine [[H3196]] as a drink offering. [[H5262]] It is an offering made by fire, [[H801]] a pleasing [[H5207]] aroma [[H7381]] to the LORD. [[H3068]]

###### 11
This [[H3602]] is to be done [[H6213]] for each [[H259]] bull, [[H7794]] ram, [[H352]] lamb, [[H7716]] or [[H176]] goat. [[H5795]]

###### 12
This is how [[H3602]] you must prepare [[H6213]] each one, [[H259]] no matter how [[H834]] many. [[H4557]]

###### 13
Everyone [[H3605]] who is native-born [[H249]] shall prepare [[H6213]] these [[H428]] things in this way [[H3602]] when he presents [[H7126]] an offering made by fire [[H801]] as a pleasing [[H5207]] aroma [[H7381]] to the LORD. [[H3068]]

###### 14
And for the generations to come, [[H1755]] if [[H3588]] a foreigner [[H1616]] residing [[H1481]] with [[H854]] you or [[H176]] someone else [[H834]] among you [[H8432]] wants to prepare [[H6213]] an offering made by fire [[H801]] as a pleasing [[H5207]] aroma [[H7381]] to the LORD, [[H3068]] he is to do [[H6213]] exactly as [[H834]] you do. [[H6213]]

###### 15
The assembly [[H6951]] is to have the same [[H259]] statute [[H2708]] for both you [[H1616]] and the foreign resident; [[H1481]] it is a permanent [[H5769]] statute [[H2708]] for the generations to come. [[H1755]] You and the foreigner [[H1616]] shall be [[H1961]] the same before [[H6440]] the LORD. [[H3068]]

###### 16
The same [[H259]] law [[H8451]] and the same [[H259]] ordinance [[H4941]] will apply [[H1961]] both to you  and the foreigner [[H1616]] residing [[H1481]] with you.” [[H854]]

###### 17
Then the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H1696]] to Moses, [[H4872]]

###### 18
“Speak [[H1696]] to [[H413]] the Israelites [[H1121]] and tell them: [[H559]] When you enter [[H935]] the land [[H776]] to which [[H834]] I [[H589]] am bringing you [[H935]]

###### 19
and you eat [[H398]] the food [[H3899]] of the land, [[H776]] you shall lift [[H7311]] up an offering [[H8641]] to the LORD. [[H3068]]

###### 20
From the first [[H7225]] of your dough, [[H6182]] you are to lift [[H7311]] up a cake [[H2471]] as a contribution; [[H8641]] offer [[H7311]] it [[H853]] just like [[H3651]] an offering [[H8641]] from the threshing floor. [[H1637]]

###### 21
Throughout your generations, [[H1755]] you are to give [[H5414]] the LORD [[H3068]] an offering [[H8641]] from the first [[H7225]] of your dough. [[H6182]]

###### 22
Now if [[H3588]] you sin unintentionally [[H7686]] and do not [[H3808]] obey [[H6213]] all [[H3605]] these [[H428]] commandments [[H4687]] that [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] has spoken [[H1696]] to [[H413]] Moses— [[H4872]]

###### 23
all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] has commanded [[H6680]] you through [[H3027]] Moses [[H4872]] from [[H4480]] the day [[H3117]] the LORD [[H3068]] gave them [[H6680]] and continuing through [[H1973]] the generations to come— [[H1755]]

###### 24
and if [[H518]] it was done [[H6213]] unintentionally [[H7684]] without the knowledge [[H5869]] of the congregation, [[H5712]] then the whole [[H3605]] congregation [[H5712]] is to prepare [[H6213]] one [[H259]] young bull [[H6499]] as a burnt offering, [[H5930]] a pleasing [[H5207]] aroma [[H7381]] to the LORD, [[H3068]] with its grain offering [[H4503]] and drink offering [[H5262]] according to the regulation, [[H4941]] and one [[H259]] male goat [[H8163]] as a sin offering. [[H2403]]

###### 25
The priest [[H3548]] is to make atonement [[H3722]] for [[H5921]] the entire [[H3605]] congregation [[H5712]] of Israel, [[H3478]] so that they may be forgiven; [[H5545]] for [[H3588]] the sin [[H1931]] was unintentional, [[H7684]] and they [[H1992]] have brought [[H935]] to the LORD [[H3068]] an offering [[H7133]] made by fire [[H801]] and a sin offering, [[H2403]] [presented] before [[H6440]] the LORD [[H3068]] for [[H5921]] their unintentional sin. [[H7684]]

###### 26
The entire [[H3605]] congregation [[H5712]] of Israel [[H3478]] and the foreigners [[H1616]] residing [[H1481]] among them [[H8432]] will be forgiven, [[H5545]] since [[H3588]] it happened to all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] unintentionally. [[H7684]]

###### 27
Also, if [[H518]] one [[H259]] person [[H5315]] sins unintentionally, [[H2398]] he is to present [[H7126]] a year-old [[H1323]] female goat [[H5795]] as a sin offering. [[H2403]]

###### 28
And the priest [[H3548]] shall make atonement [[H3722]] before [[H6440]] the LORD [[H3068]] on behalf of [[H5921]] the person [[H5315]] who erred [[H7683]] by sinning unintentionally; [[H7684]] and when atonement has been made [[H3722]] for him, [[H5921]] he will be forgiven. [[H5545]]

###### 29
You  shall have [[H1961]] the same [[H259]] law [[H8451]] for the one who acts [[H6213]] in error, [[H7684]] whether he is an Israelite [[H1121]] or a foreigner [[H1616]] residing [[H1481]] among you. [[H8432]]

###### 30
But the person [[H5315]] who [[H834]] sins defiantly, [[H3027]] whether [[H4480]] a native [[H249]] or [[H4480]] foreigner, [[H1616]] blasphemes [[H1442]] the LORD. [[H3068]] That [[H1931]] person [[H5315]] shall be cut off [[H3772]] from [[H7130]] his people. [[H5971]]

###### 31
He [[H5315]] shall certainly be cut off, [[H3772]] because [[H3588]] he has despised [[H959]] the word [[H1697]] of the LORD [[H3068]] and [[H853]] broken [[H6565]] His commandment; [[H4687]] his guilt remains on him.” [[H5771]]

###### 32
While the Israelites [[H1121]] were [[H1961]] in the wilderness, [[H4057]] a man [[H376]] was found [[H4672]] gathering [[H7197]] wood [[H6086]] on the Sabbath [[H7676]] day. [[H3117]]

###### 33
Those who found [[H4672]] [the man] [[H853]] gathering [[H7197]] wood [[H6086]] brought [[H7126]] him to [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] Aaron, [[H175]] and the entire [[H3605]] congregation, [[H5712]]

###### 34
and because [[H3588]] it had not been [[H3808]] declared [[H6567]] what [[H4100]] should be done [[H6213]] to  him,  they placed [[H3240]] him in custody. [[H4929]]

###### 35
And the LORD [[H3069]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] “The man [[H376]] must surely be put to death. [[H4191]] The entire [[H3605]] congregation [[H5712]] is to stone [[H7275]] him [[H853]] outside [[H2351]] the camp.” [[H4264]]

###### 36
So the whole [[H3605]] congregation [[H5712]] took [[H3318]] [the man] [[H853]] outside [[H2351]] the camp [[H4264]] and stoned [[H7275]] him to death, [[H4191]] as [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] had commanded [[H6680]] Moses. [[H4872]]

###### 37
Later, the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]]

###### 38
“Speak [[H1696]] to [[H413]] the Israelites [[H1121]] and tell [[H559]] them that [[H413]] throughout the generations to come [[H1755]] they are to make [[H6213]] for themselves  tassels [[H6734]] for [[H5921]] the corners [[H3671]] of their garments, [[H899]] with [[H5414]] a blue [[H8504]] cord [[H6616]] on [[H5921]] each tassel. [[H6734]]

###### 39
These will serve [[H1961]] as tassels [[H6734]] for you to look at, [[H7200]] so that you may remember [[H2142]] all [[H3605]] the commandments [[H4687]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] that you may obey [[H6213]] them [[H853]] and not [[H3808]] prostitute yourselves [[H2181]] by following [[H8446]] your own heart [[H3824]] and your own eyes. [[H5869]]

###### 40
Then [[H4616]] you will remember [[H2142]] and obey [[H6213]] all [[H3605]] My commandments, [[H4687]] and you will be [[H1961]] holy [[H6918]] to your God. [[H430]]

###### 41
I [[H589]] am the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] who [[H834]] brought you out [[H3318]] of the land [[H776]] of Egypt [[H4714]] to be [[H1961]] your God. [[H430]] I [[H589]] am the LORD [[H3068]] your God.” [[H430]]
