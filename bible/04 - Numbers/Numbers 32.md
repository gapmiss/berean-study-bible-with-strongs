### 1
Now the Reubenites [[H1121]] and Gadites, [[H1121]] who had [[H1961]] very [[H3966]] large [[H6099]] herds and flocks, [[H4735]] surveyed [[H7200]] the lands [[H776]] of Jazer [[H3270]] and Gilead, [[H1568]] and they saw [[H2009]] that the region [[H4725]] was suitable [[H4725]] for livestock. [[H4735]]

### 2
So the Gadites [[H1121]] and Reubenites [[H1121]] came [[H935]] to [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] Eleazar [[H499]] the priest, [[H3548]] and the leaders [[H5387]] of the congregation, [[H5712]] and said, [[H559]]

### 3
“Ataroth, [[H5852]] Dibon, [[H1769]] Jazer, [[H3270]] Nimrah, [[H5247]] Heshbon, [[H2809]] Elealeh, [[H500]] Sebam, [[H7643]] Nebo, [[H5015]] and Beon, [[H1194]]

### 4
which [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] conquered [[H5221]] before [[H6440]] the congregation [[H5712]] of Israel, [[H3478]] are suitable [[H776]] for livestock— [[H4735]] and your servants [[H5650]] have livestock.” [[H4735]]

### 5
“If [[H518]] we have found [[H4672]] favor [[H2580]] in your sight,” [[H5869]] they said, [[H559]] “let this [[H2063]] land [[H776]] be given [[H5414]] to your servants [[H5650]] as a possession. [[H272]] Do not [[H408]] make us cross [[H5674]] the Jordan.” [[H3383]]

### 6
But Moses [[H4872]] asked [[H559]] the Gadites [[H1121]] and Reubenites, [[H1121]] “Shall your brothers [[H251]] go [[H935]] to war [[H4421]] while you [[H859]] sit [[H3427]] here? [[H6311]]

### 7
Why [[H4100]] are you discouraging [[H5106]] the Israelites [[H1121]] from crossing [[H5674]] into [[H413]] the land [[H776]] the LORD [[H3068]] has given them? [[H5414]]

### 8
This is what [[H3541]] your fathers [[H1]] did [[H6213]] when I sent [[H7971]] them  from Kadesh-barnea [[H6947]] to look over [[H7200]] the land. [[H776]]

### 9
For when [your fathers] went up [[H5927]] to [[H5704]] the valley [[H5158]] of Eshcol [[H812]] and saw [[H7200]] the land, [[H776]] they discouraged [[H5106]] the Israelites [[H1121]] from [[H1115]] entering [[H935]] the land [[H776]] the LORD [[H3068]] had given them. [[H5414]]

### 10
So the LORD’s [[H3068]] anger [[H639]] was kindled [[H2734]] that [[H1931]] day, [[H3117]] and He swore an oath, [[H7650]] saying, [[H559]]

### 11
‘Because [[H3588]] they did not [[H3808]] follow Me [[H310]] wholeheartedly, [[H4390]] not one [[H518]] of the men [[H376]] twenty [[H6242]] years of age [[H1121]] or older [[H4605]] who came [[H5927]] out of Egypt [[H4714]] will see [[H7200]] the land [[H127]] I swore [[H7650]] to give Abraham, [[H85]] Isaac, [[H3327]] and Jacob— [[H3290]]

### 12
not one except [[H1115]] Caleb [[H3612]] son [[H1121]] of Jephunneh [[H3312]] the Kenizzite [[H7074]] and Joshua [[H3091]] son [[H1121]] of Nun— [[H5126]] because [[H3588]] they did follow [[H310]] the LORD [[H3068]] wholeheartedly.’ [[H4390]]

### 13
The LORD’s [[H3068]] anger [[H639]] burned [[H2734]] against Israel, [[H3478]] and He made them wander [[H5128]] in the wilderness [[H4057]] forty [[H705]] years, [[H8141]] until [[H5704]] the whole [[H3605]] generation [[H1755]] who had done [[H6213]] evil [[H7451]] in [His] [[H3068]] sight [[H5869]] was gone. [[H8552]]

### 14
Now behold, [[H2009]] you, a brood [[H8635]] of sinners, [[H2400]] have risen up [[H6965]] in place [[H8478]] of your fathers [[H1]] to further [[H5750]] stoke [[H5595]] the burning [[H2740]] anger [[H639]] of the LORD [[H3069]] against [[H413]] Israel. [[H3478]]

### 15
For if [[H3588]] you turn away [[H7725]] from following Him, [[H310]] He will once again [[H3254]] leave [[H3240]] this [[H2088]] people [[H5971]] in the wilderness, [[H4057]] and you will be the cause of their destruction.” [[H7843]]

### 16
Then [the Gadites and Reubenites] approached [[H5066]] [Moses] [[H413]] and said, [[H559]] “We want to build [[H1129]] sheepfolds [[H1448]] here [[H6311]] for our livestock [[H4735]] and cities [[H5892]] for our little ones. [[H2945]]

### 17
But we [[H587]] will arm ourselves [[H2502]] and be ready [[H2363]] to go ahead of [[H6440]] the Israelites [[H1121]] until [[H5704]] we have brought [[H935]] them into [[H413]] their place. [[H4725]] Meanwhile, our little ones [[H2945]] will remain [[H3427]] in the fortified [[H4013]] cities [[H5892]] for protection from [[H6440]] the inhabitants [[H3427]] of the land. [[H776]]

### 18
We will not [[H3808]] return [[H7725]] to [[H413]] our homes [[H1004]] until [[H5704]] every [[H376]] Israelite [[H1121]] has taken possession of [[H5157]] his inheritance. [[H5159]]

### 19
Yet [[H3588]] we will not [[H3808]] have an inheritance [[H5157]] with them [[H854]] across [[H5676]] the Jordan [[H3383]] and beyond, [[H1973]] because [[H3588]] our inheritance [[H5159]] has come to us [[H413]] on the east [[H4217]] side [[H5676]] of the Jordan.” [[H3383]]

### 20
“If [[H518]] you do [[H6213]] this,” [[H2088]] Moses [[H4872]] replied, [[H559]] “if [[H518]] you will arm yourselves [[H2502]] before [[H6440]] the LORD [[H3068]] for battle, [[H4421]]

### 21
and if every one [[H3605]] of your armed men [[H2502]] crosses [[H5674]] the Jordan [[H3383]] before [[H6440]] the LORD, [[H3068]] until [[H5704]] He has driven [[H3423]] His enemies [[H341]] out before Him, [[H6440]]

### 22
then when the land [[H776]] is subdued [[H3533]] before [[H6440]] the LORD, [[H3068]] you may return [[H7725]] and be [[H1961]] free [[H5355]] of obligation to the LORD [[H3068]] and to Israel. [[H3478]] And this [[H2063]] land [[H776]] will belong to [[H1961]] you as a possession [[H272]] before [[H6440]] the LORD. [[H3068]]

### 23
But if [[H518]] you do not [[H3808]] do [[H6213]] this, [[H3651]] you will certainly [[H2009]] sin [[H2398]] against the LORD; [[H3068]] and you may be assured that [[H3045]] your sin [[H2403]] will find you out. [[H4672]]

### 24
Build [[H1129]] cities [[H5892]] for your little ones [[H2945]] and folds [[H1448]] for your flocks, [[H6792]] but do [[H6213]] what you have promised.” [[H3318]]

### 25
The Gadites [[H1121]] and Reubenites [[H1121]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] “Your servants [[H5650]] will do [[H6213]] just as [[H834]] our lord [[H113]] commands. [[H6680]]

### 26
Our children, [[H2945]] our wives, [[H802]] our livestock, [[H4735]] and all [[H3605]] our animals [[H929]] will remain [[H1961]] here [[H8033]] in the cities [[H5892]] of Gilead. [[H1568]]

### 27
But your servants [[H5650]] are equipped [[H2502]] for war, [[H6635]] and every man [[H3605]] will cross over [[H5674]] to the battle [[H4421]] before [[H6440]] the LORD, [[H3068]] just as [[H834]] our lord [[H113]] says.” [[H1696]]

### 28
So Moses [[H4872]] gave orders [[H6680]] about them [[H853]] to Eleazar [[H499]] the priest, [[H3548]] to Joshua [[H3091]] son [[H1121]] of Nun, [[H5126]] and to the family [[H1]] leaders [[H7218]] of the tribes [[H4294]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

### 29
And Moses [[H4872]] said [[H559]] to them, [[H413]] “If [[H518]] the Gadites [[H1121]] and Reubenites [[H1121]] cross [[H5674]] the Jordan [[H3383]] with you, [[H854]] with every [[H3605]] man armed [[H2502]] for battle [[H4421]] before [[H6440]] the LORD, [[H3068]] and the land [[H776]] is subdued [[H3533]] before you, [[H6440]] you are to give [[H5414]] them the land [[H776]] of Gilead [[H1568]] as a possession. [[H272]]

### 30
But if [[H518]] they do not [[H3808]] go across [[H5674]] with you [[H854]] armed, [[H2502]] their possession must be [[H270]] among you [[H8432]] in the land [[H776]] of Canaan.” [[H3667]]

### 31
The Gadites [[H1121]] and Reubenites [[H1121]] replied, [[H6030]] “As [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] has spoken [[H1696]] to [[H413]] your servants, [[H5650]] so [[H3651]] we will do. [[H6213]]

### 32
We [[H5168]] will cross over [[H5674]] into the land [[H776]] of Canaan [[H3667]] armed [[H2502]] before [[H6440]] the LORD, [[H3068]] that [[H854]] we may have our inheritance [[H5159]] on this side [[H5676]] of the Jordan.” [[H3383]]

### 33
So Moses [[H4872]] gave [[H5414]] to  the Gadites, [[H1121]] to the Reubenites, [[H1121]] and to the half-tribe [[H2677]] of Manasseh [[H4519]] son [[H1121]] of Joseph, [[H3130]] the kingdom [[H4467]] of Sihon [[H5511]] king [[H4428]] of the Amorites [[H567]] and the kingdom [[H4467]] of Og [[H5747]] king [[H4428]] of Bashan— [[H1316]] the land [[H776]] including its cities [[H5892]] and the territory [[H1367]] surrounding [[H5439]] them. [[H5892]]

### 34
And the Gadites [[H1121]] built up [[H1129]] Dibon, [[H1769]] Ataroth, [[H5852]] Aroer, [[H6177]]

### 35
Atroth-shophan, [[H5855]] Jazer, [[H3270]] Jogbehah, [[H3011]]

### 36
Beth-nimrah, [[H1039]] and Beth-haran [[H1028]] as fortified [[H4013]] cities, [[H5892]] and they built folds [[H1448]] for their flocks. [[H6629]]

### 37
The Reubenites [[H1121]] built up [[H1129]] Heshbon, [[H2809]] Elealeh, [[H500]] Kiriathaim, [[H7156]]

### 38
as well as Nebo [[H5015]] and Baal-meon [[H1186]] (whose names [[H8034]] were changed), [[H5437]] and Sibmah. [[H7643]] And they renamed [[H7121]] the cities [[H5892]] they rebuilt. [[H1129]]

### 39
The descendants [[H1121]] of Machir [[H4353]] son [[H1121]] of Manasseh [[H4519]] went [[H1980]] to Gilead, [[H1568]] captured it, [[H3920]] and drove out [[H3423]] the Amorites [[H567]] who were there. [[H834]]

### 40
So Moses [[H4872]] gave [[H5414]] Gilead [[H1568]] to the clan of Machir [[H4353]] son [[H1121]] of Manasseh, [[H4519]] and they settled there. [[H3427]]

### 41
Jair, [[H2971]] a descendant [[H1121]] of Manasseh, [[H4519]] went [[H1980]] and captured [[H3920]] their villages [[H2333]] and called [[H7121]] them  Havvoth-jair. [[H2334]]

### 42
And Nobah [[H5025]] went [[H1980]] and captured [[H3920]] Kenath [[H7079]] and its villages [[H1323]] and called it [[H7121]] Nobah, [[H5025]] after his own name. [[H8034]]
