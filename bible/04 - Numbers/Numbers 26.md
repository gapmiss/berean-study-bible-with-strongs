“The land [[H776]] is to be divided [[H2505]] among [the tribes] [[H428]] as an inheritance, [[H5159]] according to the number [[H4557]] of names. [[H8034]]

###### 54
Increase [[H7235]] the inheritance [[H5159]] for a large [tribe] [[H7227]] and decrease [[H4591]] it [[H5159]] for a small one; [[H4592]] each [[H376]] is to receive [[H5414]] its inheritance [[H5159]] according to [[H6310]] the number of those registered. [[H6485]]

###### 55
Indeed, [[H389]] the land [[H776]] must be divided [[H2505]] by lot; [[H1486]] they shall receive their inheritance [[H5157]] according to the names [[H8034]] of the tribes [[H4294]] of their fathers. [[H1]]

###### 56
Each inheritance [[H5159]] is to be divided [[H2505]] by [[H5921]] lot [[H1486]] among [[H996]] the larger [[H7227]] and smaller tribes.” [[H4592]]

###### 57

[[H4940]] Now Kohath [[H6955]] was the father of [[H3205]] Amram, [[H6019]]

###### 62
The registration [of the Levites] [[H6485]] totaled [[H1961]] 23,000, [[H7969]] every [[H3605]] male [[H2145]] one month old [[H1121]] or more; [[H4605]] they were not [[H3808]] registered [[H6485]] among [[H8432]] the other Israelites, [[H1121]] because [[H3588]] no [[H3808]] inheritance [[H5159]] was given [[H5414]] to them among [[H8432]] the Israelites. [[H1121]]

###### 63
These [[H428]] were the ones registered [[H6485]] by Moses [[H4872]] and Eleazar [[H499]] the priest [[H3548]] when [[H834]] they numbered [[H6485]] the Israelites [[H1121]] on the plains [[H6160]] of Moab [[H4124]] by [[H5921]] the Jordan, [[H3383]] across from Jericho. [[H3405]]

###### 64
Among all these, however, [[H428]] there was [[H1961]] not [[H3808]] one [[H376]] who had been registered [[H6485]] by Moses [[H4872]] and Aaron [[H175]] the priest [[H3548]] when [[H834]] they numbered [[H6485]] the Israelites [[H1121]] in the Wilderness [[H4057]] of Sinai. [[H5514]]

###### 65
For [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] had told [[H559]] them  that they would surely die [[H4191]] in the wilderness. [[H4057]] Not one [[H3808]] was left [[H3498]] except [[H3588]] Caleb [[H3612]] son [[H1121]] of Jephunneh [[H3312]] and Joshua [[H3091]] son [[H1121]] of Nun. [[H5126]]
