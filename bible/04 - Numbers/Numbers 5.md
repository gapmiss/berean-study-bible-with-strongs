### 1
Then the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H1696]] to Moses, [[H4872]]

### 2
“Command [[H6680]] the Israelites [[H1121]] to send away [[H7971]] from [[H4480]] the camp [[H4264]] anyone [[H3605]] with a skin disease, [[H6879]] anyone [[H3605]] who has a bodily discharge, [[H2100]] and anyone [[H3605]] who is defiled [[H2931]] by a dead body. [[H5315]]

### 3
You must send away [[H7971]] male [[H2145]] and [[H5704]] female alike; [[H5347]] send them [[H7971]] outside [[H2351]] the camp, [[H4264]] so that they will not [[H3808]] defile [[H2930]] their camp [[H4264]] where [[H834]] I [[H589]] dwell [[H7931]] among them.” [[H8432]]

### 4
The Israelites [[H1121]] did [[H6213]] this, [[H3651]] sending [[H7971]] [such people] [[H853]] outside [[H2351]] the camp. [[H4264]] [They] [[H1121]] did [[H6213]] just as [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] had instructed [[H1696]] Moses. [[H4872]]

### 5
And the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H1696]] to [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]]

### 6
“Tell [[H1696]] the Israelites that [[H1121]] when [[H3588]] a man [[H376]] or [[H176]] woman [[H802]] acts [[H4603]] unfaithfully [[H4604]] against the LORD [[H3068]] by committing [[H6213]] any [[H3605]] sin [[H2403]] against another, [[H120]] that [[H1931]] person [[H5315]] is guilty [[H816]]

### 7
and must confess [[H3034]] the sin [[H2403]] he has committed. [[H6213]] He must pay full compensation, [[H7725]] add [[H3254]] a fifth [[H2549]] to its value, [[H5921]] and give all this [[H5414]] to the one [[H834]] he has wronged. [[H816]]

### 8
But if [[H518]] the man [[H376]] has no [[H369]] relative [[H1350]] to compensate, [[H7725]] the restitution [[H7725]] belongs to the LORD [[H3068]] and must be given to the priest [[H3548]] along with [[H905]] the ram [[H352]] of atonement, [[H3725]] by which [[H834]] the atonement is made [[H3722]] for him. [[H5921]]

### 9
Every [[H3605]] sacred [[H6944]] contribution [[H8641]] the Israelites [[H1121]] bring [[H7126]] to the priest [[H3548]] shall belong [[H1961]] to him. 

### 10
Each man’s [[H376]] sacred gifts [[H6944]] are his own,  [but] whatever [[H834]] [he] [[H376]] gives [[H5414]] to the priest [[H3548]] will belong to [[H1961]] [the priest].” 

### 11
Then the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H1696]] to [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]]

### 12
“Speak [[H1696]] to [[H413]] the Israelites [[H1121]] and tell them that [[H559]] if [[H3588]] any man’s [[H376]] wife [[H802]] goes astray [[H7847]] and is unfaithful [[H4603]] to him [[H4604]]

### 13
by sleeping with [[H7901]] another man, [[H376]] and it is concealed [[H5956]] from [[H5869]] her husband [[H376]] and her [[H1931]] impurity [[H2930]] is undetected [[H5641]] (since there is no [[H369]] witness against her [[H5707]] and she [[H1931]] was not [[H3808]] caught in the act), [[H8610]]

### 14
and if a feeling [[H7307]] of jealousy [[H7068]] comes over [[H5674]] [her husband] [[H5921]] and he suspects [[H7065]] his wife [[H802]] who [[H1931]] has defiled herself— [[H2930]] or [[H176]] if a feeling [[H7307]] of jealousy [[H7068]] comes over [[H5674]] him [[H5921]] and he suspects [[H7065]] her [[H802]] even though she [[H1931]] has not [[H3808]] defiled herself— [[H2930]]

### 15
then [he] [[H376]] is to bring [[H935]] his wife [[H802]] to [[H413]] the priest. [[H3548]] He must also bring [[H935]] for her [[H5921]] an offering [[H7133]] of a tenth [[H6224]] of an ephah [[H374]] of barley [[H8184]] flour. [[H7058]] He is not [[H3808]] to pour [[H3332]] oil [[H8081]] over [[H5921]] it or put [[H5414]] frankincense [[H3828]] on it, [[H5921]] because [[H3588]] it [[H1931]] is a grain offering [[H4503]] for jealousy, [[H7068]] an offering [[H4503]] of memorial [[H2146]] as a reminder [[H2142]] of iniquity. [[H5771]]

### 16
The priest [[H3548]] is to bring [the wife] forward [[H7126]] and have her stand [[H5975]] before [[H6440]] the LORD. [[H3069]]

### 17
Then [he] [[H3548]] is to take [[H3947]] [some] holy [[H6918]] water [[H4325]] in a clay [[H2789]] jar [[H3627]] and put [[H5414]] some of [[H4480]] the dust [[H6083]] from the tabernacle [[H4908]] floor [[H7172]] into [[H413]] the water. [[H4325]]

### 18
After the priest [[H3548]] has the woman [[H802]] stand [[H5975]] before [[H6440]] the LORD, [[H3068]] he is to let down [[H6544]] her [[H802]] hair [[H7218]] and place [[H5414]] in [[H5921]] her hands [[H3709]] the grain offering [[H4503]] of memorial, [[H2146]] which [[H1931]] is the grain offering [[H4503]] for jealousy. [[H7068]] The priest [[H3548]] is [[H1961]] to hold [[H3027]] the bitter [[H4751]] water [[H4325]] that brings a curse. [[H779]]

### 19
And [he] [[H3548]] is to require the woman to take an oath [[H7650]] and say [[H559]] to [[H413]] her, [[H802]] ‘If [[H518]] no other [[H3808]] man [[H376]] has slept with you [[H7901]] and [[H518]] you have not [[H3808]] gone astray [[H7847]] and become defiled [[H2932]] while under [[H8478]] your husband’s authority, [[H376]] may you be immune [[H5352]] to this [[H428]] bitter [[H4751]] water [[H4325]] that brings a curse. [[H779]]

### 20
But if [[H3588]] you [[H859]] have gone astray [[H7847]] while under [[H8478]] your husband’s authority [[H376]] and [[H3588]] defiled yourself [[H2930]] with a man [[H376]] other than [[H1107]] your husband [[H376]] who has slept [[H5414]] with you’— [[H7903]]

### 21
then the priest [[H3548]] shall have the woman [[H802]] swear [[H7650]] under the oath [[H7621]] of the curse— [[H423]] ‘May the LORD [[H3068]] make [[H5414]] you [[H853]] an attested [[H423]] curse [[H7621]] among [[H8432]] your people [[H5971]] if [He] [[H3068]] makes [[H5414]] your thigh [[H3409]] shrivel [[H5307]] and your belly [[H990]] swell. [[H6638]]

### 22
May this [[H428]] water [[H4325]] that brings a curse [[H779]] enter [[H935]] your stomach [[H4578]] and cause your belly [[H990]] to swell [[H6638]] and your thigh [[H3409]] to shrivel.’ [[H5307]] Then the woman [[H802]] is to say, [[H559]] ‘Amen, [[H543]] Amen.’ [[H543]]

### 23
And the priest [[H3548]] shall write [[H3789]] these [[H428]] curses [[H423]] on a scroll [[H5612]] and wash them off [[H4229]] into [[H413]] the bitter [[H4751]] water. [[H4325]]

### 24
He is to have the woman [[H802]] drink [[H8248]] the bitter [[H4751]] water [[H4325]] that brings a curse, [[H779]] and it [[H4325]] will enter [[H935]] her  and cause her bitter [[H4751]] suffering. [[H779]]

### 25
The priest [[H3548]] shall take [[H3947]] from [her] [[H802]] hand [[H3027]] the grain offering [[H4503]] for jealousy, [[H7068]] wave [[H5130]] [it] [[H4503]] before [[H6440]] the LORD, [[H3068]] and bring [[H7126]] it to [[H413]] the altar. [[H4196]]

### 26
The priest is then [[H3548]] to take a handful [[H7061]] of [[H4480]] the grain offering [[H4503]] as a memorial portion [[H234]] and burn [[H6999]] it on the altar; [[H4196]] after that [[H310]] he is to have the woman [[H802]] drink [[H8248]] the water. [[H4325]]

### 27
When he has made her drink [[H8248]] the water, [[H4325]] if [[H518]] she has defiled [[H2930]] herself and been unfaithful [[H4603]] to her husband, [[H376]] then the water [[H4325]] that brings a curse [[H779]] will enter [[H935]] her  and cause bitter suffering; [[H4751]] her belly [[H990]] will swell, [[H6638]] her thigh [[H3409]] will shrivel, [[H5307]] and she will become [[H1961]] accursed [[H423]] among [[H7130]] her people. [[H5971]]

### 28
But if [[H518]] the woman [[H802]] has not [[H3808]] defiled herself [[H2930]] and is clean, [[H2889]] she [[H1931]] will be unaffected [[H5352]] and able to conceive [[H2232]] children. [[H2233]]

### 29
This [[H2063]] is the law [[H8451]] of jealousy [[H7068]] when [[H834]] a wife [[H802]] goes astray [[H7847]] and defiles herself [[H2930]] while under [[H8478]] her husband’s authority, [[H376]]

### 30
or [[H176]] when [[H834]] a feeling [[H7307]] of jealousy [[H7068]] comes over [[H5674]] a husband [[H376]] and he suspects [[H7065]] his wife. [[H802]] He is to have the woman [[H802]] stand [[H5975]] before [[H6440]] the LORD, [[H3068]] and the priest [[H3548]] is to apply [[H6213]] to her  this [[H2063]] entire [[H3605]] ritual. [[H8451]]

### 31
The husband [[H376]] will be free [[H5352]] from guilt, [[H5771]] but the [[H1931]] woman [[H802]] shall bear [[H5375]] her [[H853]] iniquity.” [[H5771]]
