###### 47
The Levites, however, [[H3881]] were not [[H3808]] registered [[H6485]] with [[H8432]] the tribe [[H4294]] of their fathers. [[H1]]

###### 48
For the LORD [[H3068]] had said to [[H1696]] Moses: [[H4872]]

###### 49
“Do not [[H3808]] register [[H6485]] the tribe [[H4294]] of Levi [[H3881]] in the census [[H7218]] with [[H8432]] the other Israelites. [[H1121]]

###### 50
Instead, [[H859]] you are to appoint [[H6485]] the Levites [[H3881]] over [[H5921]] the tabernacle [[H4908]] of the testimony, [[H5715]] all [[H3605]] its furnishings, [[H3627]] and everything in it. [[H3605]] They [[H1992]] shall carry [[H5375]] the tabernacle [[H4908]] and all [[H3605]] its articles, [[H3627]] care for it, [[H8334]] and camp [[H2583]] around [[H5439]] it. [[H4908]]

###### 51
Whenever the tabernacle [[H4908]] is to move, [[H5265]] the Levites [[H3881]] are to take it down, [[H3381]] and whenever it [[H4908]] is to be pitched, [[H2583]] the Levites [[H3881]] are to set it up. [[H6965]] Any outsider [[H2114]] who goes near it [[H7126]] must be put to death. [[H4191]]

###### 52
The Israelites [[H1121]] are to camp [[H2583]] by their divisions, [[H6635]] each man [[H376]] in [[H5921]] his own camp [[H4264]] and under [[H5921]] his own [family] banner. [[H1714]]

###### 53
But the Levites [[H3881]] are to camp [[H2583]] around [[H5439]] the tabernacle [[H4908]] of the Testimony [[H5715]] and watch over it, [[H8104]] so that no [[H3808]] wrath [[H7110]] shall fall [[H1961]] on [[H5921]] the Israelite [[H1121]] congregation. [[H5712]] So the Levites [[H3881]] are responsible [[H4931]] for the tabernacle [[H4908]] of the Testimony.” [[H5715]]

###### 54
Thus the Israelites [[H1121]] did [[H6213]] everything [[H3605]] just as [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] had commanded [[H6680]] Moses. [[H4872]]
