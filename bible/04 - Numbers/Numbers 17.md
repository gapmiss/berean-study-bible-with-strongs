###### 1
And the LORD [[H3068]] said to [[H1696]] Moses, [[H4872]]

###### 2
“Speak [[H1696]] to [[H413]] the Israelites [[H1121]] and take [[H3947]] from them [[H853]] twelve [[H8147]] staffs, [[H4294]] [one] [[H4294]] from the leader [[H5387]] of each [[H3605]] tribe. [[H1]] Write [[H3789]] each [[H376]] man’s name [[H8034]] on [[H5921]] his staff, [[H4294]]

###### 3
and [[H853]] write [[H3789]] Aaron’s [[H175]] name [[H8034]] on [[H5921]] the staff [[H4294]] of Levi, [[H3878]] because [[H3588]] there must be one [[H259]] staff [[H4294]] for the head [[H7218]] of each tribe. [[H1]]

###### 4
Place [the staffs] [[H3240]] in the Tent [[H168]] of Meeting [[H4150]] in front [[H6440]] of the Testimony, [[H5715]] where [[H834]] I meet with you. [[H3259]]

###### 5
The staff [[H4294]] belonging to the man [[H376]] I choose [[H977]] will sprout, [[H6524]] and I will rid [[H7918]] Myself [[H5921]] of the constant grumbling [[H8519]] of the Israelites [[H1121]] against you.” [[H5921]]

###### 6
So Moses [[H4872]] spoke [[H1696]] to [[H413]] the Israelites, [[H1121]] and each [[H3605]] of their leaders [[H5387]] gave [[H5414]] him a [[H259]] staff— [[H4294]] one [[H4294]] for each [[H259]] of the leaders [[H5387]] of their tribes, [[H1]] twelve [[H8147]] staffs in all. [[H4294]] And Aaron’s [[H175]] staff [[H4294]] was among [[H8432]] [them]. [[H4294]]

###### 7
Then Moses [[H4872]] placed [[H3240]] the staffs [[H4294]] before [[H6440]] the LORD [[H3068]] in the Tent [[H168]] of the Testimony. [[H5715]]

###### 8
The next day [[H4283]] Moses [[H4872]] entered [[H935]] the Tent [[H168]] of the Testimony [[H5715]] and saw [[H2009]] that Aaron’s [[H175]] staff, [[H4294]] representing the house [[H1004]] of Levi, [[H3878]] had sprouted, [[H6524]] put forth [[H3318]] buds, [[H6525]] blossomed, [[H6692]] and produced [[H1580]] almonds! [[H8247]]

###### 9
Then Moses [[H4872]] brought out [[H3318]] all [[H3605]] the staffs [[H4294]] from the LORD's [[H3069]] presence [[H6440]] to [[H413]] all [[H3605]] the Israelites. [[H1121]] They saw them, [[H7200]] and each man [[H376]] took [[H3947]] his own staff. [[H4294]]

###### 10
The LORD [[H3068]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] “Put Aaron’s [[H175]] staff [[H4294]] back [[H7725]] in front [[H6440]] of the Testimony, [[H5715]] to be kept [[H4931]] as a sign [[H226]] for the rebellious, [[H1121]] so that you may put an end [[H3615]] to their grumbling [[H8519]] against Me, [[H5921]] lest [[H3808]] they die.” [[H4191]]

###### 11
So Moses [[H4872]] did [[H6213]] as [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] had commanded him. [[H6680]]

###### 12
Then the Israelites [[H1121]] declared [[H559]] to [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] “Look, [[H2005]] we are perishing! [[H1478]] We are lost; [[H6]] we are all [[H3605]] lost! [[H6]]

###### 13
Anyone [[H3605]] who comes near [[H7131]] the tabernacle [[H4908]] of the LORD [[H3068]] will die. [[H4191]] Are we all [[H8552]] going to perish?” [[H1478]]
