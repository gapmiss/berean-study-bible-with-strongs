### 1
This [[H428]] is the account [[H8435]] of Aaron [[H175]] and Moses [[H4872]] at the time [[H3117]] the LORD [[H3068]] spoke [[H1696]] to [[H854]] Moses [[H4872]] on Mount [[H2022]] Sinai. [[H5514]]

### 2
These [[H428]] are the names [[H8034]] of the sons [[H1121]] of Aaron: [[H175]] Nadab [[H5070]] the firstborn; [[H1060]] then Abihu, [[H30]] Eleazar, [[H499]] and Ithamar. [[H385]]

### 3
These [[H428]] [were] Aaron’s [[H175]] sons, [[H1121]] the anointed [[H4886]] priests, [[H3548]] who [[H834]] were ordained [[H4390]] to serve as priests. [[H3547]]

### 4
Nadab [[H5070]] and Abihu, however, [[H30]] died [[H4191]] in the presence [[H6440]] of the LORD [[H3068]] when they offered [[H7126]] strange [[H2114]] fire [[H784]] before [[H6440]] the LORD [[H3068]] in the Wilderness [[H4057]] of Sinai. [[H5514]] And since they had [[H1961]] no [[H3808]] sons, [[H1121]] only Eleazar [[H499]] and Ithamar [[H385]] served as priests [[H3547]] during [[H5921]] the lifetime [[H6440]] of their father [[H1]] Aaron. [[H175]]

### 5
Then the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H1696]] to [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]]

### 6
“Bring [[H7126]] the tribe [[H4294]] of Levi [[H3881]] and present [[H5975]] them to [[H6440]] Aaron [[H175]] the priest [[H3548]] to assist him. [[H8334]]

### 7
They are to perform [[H8104]] duties for him [[H4931]] and for the whole [[H3605]] congregation [[H5712]] before [[H6440]] the Tent [[H168]] of Meeting, [[H4150]] attending [[H5647]] to the service [[H5656]] of the tabernacle. [[H4908]]

### 8
They shall take care of [[H8104]] all [[H3605]] the furnishings [[H3627]] of the Tent [[H168]] of Meeting [[H4150]] and [[H853]] fulfill obligations [[H4931]] for the Israelites [[H1121]] by attending [[H5647]] to the service [[H5656]] of the tabernacle. [[H4908]]

### 9
Assign [[H5414]] the Levites [[H3881]] to Aaron [[H175]] and his sons; [[H1121]] they [[H1992]] have been given exclusively [[H5414]] to him  from among [[H854]] the Israelites. [[H1121]]

### 10
So [[H853]] you shall appoint [[H6485]] Aaron [[H175]] and his sons [[H1121]] to carry out [[H8104]] the duties of the priesthood; [[H3550]] but any layman [[H2114]] who approaches [the tabernacle] [[H7126]] must be put to death.” [[H4191]]

### 11
Again the LORD [[H3069]] spoke [[H1696]] to [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] saying, [[H559]]

### 12
“Behold, [[H2009]] I [[H589]] have taken [[H3947]] the Levites [[H3881]] from among [[H8432]] the children [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] in place of [[H8478]] every [[H3605]] firstborn [[H6363]] Israelite [[H1121]] from the womb. [[H7358]] The Levites [[H3881]] belong [[H1961]] to Me, 

### 13
because [[H3588]] all [[H3605]] the firstborn [[H1060]] [are] Mine.  On the day [[H3117]] I struck down [[H5221]] every [[H3605]] firstborn [[H1060]] in the land [[H776]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] I consecrated [[H6942]] to Myself  all [[H3605]] the firstborn [[H1060]] in Israel, [[H3478]] both man [[H120]] and [[H5704]] beast. [[H929]] They are Mine; [[H1961]] I [[H589]] am the LORD.” [[H3068]]

### 14
Then the LORD [[H3068]] spoke [[H1696]] to [[H413]] Moses [[H4872]] in the Wilderness [[H4057]] of Sinai, [[H5514]] saying, [[H559]]

### 15
“Register [[H6485]] the Levites [[H1121]] by their families [[H1]] and clans. [[H4940]] You are to count [[H6485]] every [[H3605]] male [[H2145]] a month old [[H1121]] or more.” [[H4605]]

### 16
So Moses [[H4872]] numbered [[H6485]] them [[H853]] according to [[H5921]] the word [[H6310]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] as [[H834]] he had been commanded. [[H6680]]

### 46
To redeem [[H6302]] the 273 [[H7969]] firstborn [[H1060]] Israelites [[H1121]] who outnumber [[H5736]] the Levites, [[H3881]]
