### 1
And when Balaam [[H1109]] saw [[H7200]] that [[H3588]] it pleased [[H2895]] the LORD [[H3068]] to bless [[H1288]] Israel, [[H3478]] he did not [[H3808]] resort [[H1980]] to sorcery [[H5173]] as on previous occasions, [[H6471]] but he turned [[H7896]] his face [[H6440]] toward [[H413]] the wilderness. [[H4057]]

### 2
When Balaam [[H1109]] looked up [[H5375]] and saw [[H7200]] Israel [[H3478]] encamped [[H7931]] tribe by tribe, [[H7626]] the Spirit [[H7307]] of God [[H430]] came [[H1961]] upon him, [[H5921]]

### 3
and he lifted up [[H5375]] an oracle, [[H4912]] saying: [[H559]] “[This is] the prophecy [[H5002]] of Balaam [[H1109]] son [[H1121]] of Beor, [[H1160]] the prophecy [[H5002]] of a man [[H1397]] whose eyes [[H5869]] are open, [[H8365]]

### 4
the prophecy [[H5002]] of one who hears [[H8085]] the words [[H561]] of God, [[H410]] who [[H834]] sees [[H2372]] a vision [[H4236]] from the Almighty, [[H7706]] who bows down [[H5307]] with eyes [[H5869]] wide open: [[H1540]]

### 5
How [[H4100]] beautiful [[H2895]] are your tents, [[H168]] O Jacob, [[H3290]] your dwellings, [[H4908]] O Israel! [[H3478]]

### 6
They spread out [[H5186]] like palm groves, [[H5158]] like gardens [[H1593]] beside [[H5921]] a stream, [[H5104]] like aloes [[H174]] the LORD [[H3068]] has planted, [[H5193]] like cedars [[H730]] beside [[H5921]] the waters. [[H4325]]

### 7
Water [[H4325]] will flow [[H5140]] from his buckets, [[H1805]] and his seed [[H2233]] will have abundant [[H7227]] water. [[H4325]] His king [[H4428]] will be greater [[H7311]] than Agag, [[H90]] and his kingdom [[H4438]] will be exalted. [[H5375]]

### 8
God [[H410]] brought him [[H3318]] out of Egypt [[H4714]] with strength [[H8443]] like a wild ox, [[H7214]] to devour [[H398]] hostile [[H6862]] nations [[H1471]] and crush [[H1633]] their bones, [[H6106]] to pierce them [[H4272]] with arrows. [[H2671]]

### 9
He crouches, [[H3766]] he lies down [[H7901]] like a lion; [[H738]] like a lioness, [[H3833]] who [[H4310]] dares to rouse him? [[H6965]] Blessed are [[H1288]] those who bless you [[H1288]] and cursed are [[H779]] those who curse you. [[H779]]

### 10
Then Balak’s [[H1111]] anger [[H639]] burned [[H2734]] against [[H413]] Balaam, [[H1109]] and he struck his hands [[H3709]] together [[H5606]] and said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Balaam, [[H1109]] “I summoned you [[H7121]] to curse [[H6895]] my enemies, [[H341]] but behold, [[H2009]] you have persisted [[H1288]] in blessing [[H1288]] [them] these [[H2088]] three [[H7969]] times. [[H6471]]

### 11
Therefore, flee [[H1272]] at once [[H6258]] to [[H413]] your home! [[H4725]] I said [[H559]] I would richly reward you, [[H3513]] but instead [[H2009]] the LORD [[H3068]] has denied [[H4513]] your reward.” [[H3519]]

### 12
Balaam [[H1109]] answered [[H559]] Balak, [[H1111]] “Did I not [[H3808]] already [[H1571]] tell [[H1696]] the messengers [[H4397]] you sent me [[H7971]]

### 13
that even if [[H518]] Balak [[H1111]] were to give [[H5414]] me  his house [[H1004]] full [[H4393]] of silver [[H3701]] and gold, [[H2091]] I could [[H3201]] not [[H3808]] do [[H6213]] anything of my own accord, [[H3820]] good [[H2896]] or [[H176]] bad, [[H7451]] to go beyond [[H5674]] the command [[H6310]] of the LORD? [[H3068]] I will speak [[H1696]] whatever [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] says. [[H1696]]

### 14
Now [[H6258]] I am going back [[H1980]] to my people, [[H5971]] but come, [[H1980]] let me warn you [[H3289]] what [[H834]] this [[H2088]] people [[H5971]] will do [[H6213]] to your people [[H5971]] in the days [[H3117]] to come.” [[H319]]

### 15
Then [Balaam] lifted up [[H5375]] an oracle, [[H4912]] saying, [[H559]] “[This is] the prophecy [[H5002]] of Balaam [[H1109]] son [[H1121]] of Beor, [[H1160]] the prophecy [[H5002]] of a man [[H1397]] whose eyes [[H5869]] are open, [[H8365]]

### 16
the prophecy [[H5002]] of one who hears [[H8085]] the words [[H561]] of God, [[H410]] who has knowledge [[H3045]] from the Most High, [[H5945]] who sees [[H2372]] a vision [[H4236]] from the Almighty, [[H7706]] who bows down [[H5307]] with eyes [[H5869]] wide open: [[H1540]]

### 17
I see him, [[H7200]] but not [[H3808]] now; [[H6258]] I behold him, [[H7789]] but not [[H3808]] near. [[H7138]] A star [[H3556]] will come [[H1869]] out of Jacob, [[H3290]] and a scepter [[H7626]] will arise [[H6965]] from Israel. [[H3478]] He will crush [[H4272]] the skulls [[H6285]] of Moab [[H4124]] and strike down [[H6979]] all [[H3605]] the sons [[H1121]] of Sheth. [[H8351]]

### 18
Edom [[H123]] will become [[H1961]] a possession, [[H3424]] Seir [[H8165]] will be [[H1961]] owned [[H3424]] by his enemies, [[H341]] but Israel [[H3478]] will perform [[H6213]] with valor. [[H2428]]

### 19
A ruler will come [[H7287]] from Jacob [[H3290]] and destroy [[H6]] the remnant [[H8300]] of the city.” [[H5892]]

### 20
Then Balaam saw [[H7200]] Amalek [[H6002]] and lifted up [[H5375]] an oracle, [[H4912]] saying: [[H559]] “Amalek [[H6002]] was first [[H7225]] among the nations, [[H1471]] but his end [[H319]] [shall be] destruction.” [[H8]]

### 21
Next he saw [[H7200]] the Kenites [[H7017]] and lifted up [[H5375]] an oracle, [[H4912]] saying: [[H559]] “Your dwelling place [[H4186]] is secure, [[H386]] and your nest [[H7064]] is set [[H7760]] in a cliff. [[H5553]]

### 22
Yet [[H3588]] Kain [[H7014]] will be [[H1961]] destroyed [[H1197]] when [[H5704]] Asshur [[H804]] takes you captive.” [[H7617]]

### 23
Once more [Balaam] lifted up [[H5375]] an oracle, [[H4912]] saying: [[H559]] “Ah, [[H188]] who [[H4310]] can live [[H2421]] unless God [[H410]] has ordained it? [[H7760]]

### 24
Ships [[H6716]] [will come] from the coast [[H3027]] of Kittim; [[H3794]] they will subdue [[H6031]] Asshur [[H804]] and Eber, [[H5677]] but they [[H1931]] too [[H1571]] will perish [[H8]] forever.” [[H5703]]

### 25
Then Balaam [[H1109]] arose [[H6965]] and returned [[H7725]] to his homeland, [[H4725]] and Balak [[H1111]] also [[H1571]] went [[H1980]] on his way. [[H1870]]
