Then the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H1696]] to [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]]

### 2
“Command [[H6680]] the Israelites [[H1121]] and say [[H559]] to them: [[H413]] When [[H3588]] you [[H859]] enter [[H935]] the land [[H776]] of Canaan, [[H3667]] it [[H776]] will be allotted [[H5307]] to you as an inheritance [[H5159]] with these boundaries: [[H1367]]

### 3
Your southern [[H5045]] border [[H6285]] will extend [[H1961]] from the wilderness [[H4057]] of Zin [[H6790]] along [[H5921]] the border [[H3027]] of Edom. [[H123]] On the east, [[H6924]] your southern [[H5045]] border [[H1366]] will extend [[H1961]] from the end [[H7097]] of the Salt [[H4417]] Sea, [[H3220]]

### 4
turn [[H5437]] from the south [[H5045]] to the ascent of Akrabbim, [[H4610]] continue [[H5674]] to Zin, [[H6790]] and go [[H1961]] south [[H5045]] of Kadesh-barnea. [[H6947]] Then it will go on [[H3318]] to Hazar-addar [[H2692]] and proceed [[H5674]] to Azmon, [[H6111]]

### 5
where [it] [[H1366]] will turn [[H5437]] from Azmon, [[H6111]] join the Brook [[H5158]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] and end [[H1961]] at the Sea. [[H3220]]

### 6
Your western [[H3220]] border [[H1366]] will be [[H1961]] the coastline [[H1366]] of the Great [[H1419]] Sea; [[H3220]] this [[H2088]] will be [[H1961]] your  boundary [[H1366]] on the west. [[H3220]]

### 7
Your northern [[H6828]] border [[H1366]] will run [[H1961]] from [[H4480]] the Great [[H1419]] Sea [[H3220]] directly [[H8376]] to Mount [[H2022]] Hor, [[H2023]]

### 8
and from Mount [[H2022]] Hor [[H2023]] to Lebo-hamath, [[H2574]] [then] [[H1366]] extending [[H1961]] to Zedad, [[H6657]]

### 9
continuing [[H3318]] to Ziphron, [[H2202]] and ending [[H1961]] at Hazar-enan. [[H2704]] This [[H2088]] will be [[H1961]] your  boundary [[H1366]] on the north. [[H6828]]

### 10
And your eastern [[H6924]] border [[H1366]] will run straight [[H184]] from  Hazar-enan [[H2704]] to Shepham, [[H8221]]

### 11
[then] [[H1366]] go down [[H3381]] from Shepham [[H8221]] to Riblah [[H7247]] on the east side [[H6924]] of Ain [[H5871]] and continue along [[H3381]] the slopes [[H3802]] east [[H6924]] of the Sea [[H3220]] of Chinnereth. [[H3672]]

### 12
Then the border [[H1366]] will go down [[H3381]] along the Jordan [[H3383]] and end [[H1961]] at the Salt [[H4417]] Sea. [[H3220]] This [[H2063]] will be [[H1961]] your land, [[H776]] defined by its borders [[H1367]] on all sides.” [[H5439]]

### 13
So Moses [[H4872]] commanded [[H6680]] the Israelites, [[H1121]] “{Apportion} this [[H2063]] land [[H776]] by lot [[H1486]] as an inheritance, [[H5157]] which [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] commanded [[H6680]] to be given [[H5414]] to the nine [[H8672]] and a half [[H2677]] tribes. [[H4294]]

### 14
