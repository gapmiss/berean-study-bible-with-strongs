### 1
Then Moses [[H4872]] said [[H1696]] to the heads [[H7218]] of the tribes [[H4294]] of Israel, [[H3478]] “This [[H2088]] is what [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] has commanded: [[H6680]]

### 2
If [[H3588]] a man [[H376]] makes [[H5087]] a vow [[H5088]] to the LORD [[H3069]] or [[H176]] swears [[H7650]] an oath [[H7621]] to obligate [[H631]] himself [[H5315]] by a pledge, [[H632]] he must not [[H3808]] break [[H2490]] his word; [[H1697]] he must do [[H6213]] everything [[H3605]] he has promised. [[H3318]]

### 3
And if [[H3588]] a woman [[H802]] in her father’s [[H1]] house [[H1004]] during her youth [[H5271]] makes [[H5087]] a vow [[H5088]] to the LORD [[H3068]] or obligates herself [[H631]] by a pledge, [[H632]]

### 4
and her father [[H1]] hears about [[H8085]] her vow [[H5088]] or pledge [[H632]] [but] [[H1]] says nothing to her, [[H2790]] all [[H3605]] the vows [[H5088]] [and] [[H3605]] pledges [[H632]] with which she has bound [[H631]] herself [[H5315]] shall stand. [[H6965]]

### 5
But if [[H518]] her father [[H1]] prohibits [[H5106]] her on the day [[H3117]] he hears [[H8085]] about it, [[H3605]] none [[H3808]] of the vows [[H5088]] or pledges [[H632]] with which she has bound [[H631]] herself [[H5315]] are binding. [[H6965]] The LORD [[H3068]] will absolve [[H5545]] her  because [[H3588]] her father [[H1]] has prohibited her. [[H5106]]

### 6
If [[H518]] a woman marries [[H1961]] while under a vow [[H5088]] or [[H176]] rash promise [[H4008]] by which [[H834]] she [[H5315]] has bound [[H631]] herself, [[H5921]]

### 7
and her husband [[H376]] hears of it [[H8085]] but says nothing [[H2790]] to her  on that day, [[H3117]] then the vows [[H5088]] and pledges [[H632]] by which [[H834]] she [[H5315]] has bound [[H631]] herself [[H5921]] shall stand. [[H6965]]

### 8
But if [[H518]] her husband [[H376]] prohibits [[H5106]] her [[H853]] when [[H3117]] he hears of it, [[H8085]] he nullifies [[H6565]] the vow [[H5088]] that [[H834]] binds her [[H5921]] or the rash promise [[H4008]] she [[H5315]] has made, [[H631]] and the LORD [[H3068]] will absolve [[H5545]] her. 

### 9
Every [[H3605]] vow [[H5088]] a widow [[H490]] or divorced woman [[H1644]] pledges to fulfill [[H631]] is binding [[H6965]] on her. [[H5921]]

### 10
If [[H518]] a woman in her husband’s [[H376]] house [[H1004]] has made a vow [[H5087]] or [[H176]] put herself [[H5315]] under [[H5921]] an obligation [[H631]] with an oath, [[H7621]]

### 11
and her husband [[H376]] hears of it [[H8085]] says nothing [[H2790]] to her  and does not [[H3808]] prohibit her, [[H5106]] then all [[H3605]] the vows [[H5088]] [and] [[H3605]] obligations [[H632]] with which she has bound [[H631]] herself [[H5315]] shall stand. [[H6965]]

### 12
But if [[H518]] her husband [[H376]] nullifies [[H6565]] them on the day [[H3117]] he hears of them, [[H8085]] then nothing [[H3605]] that came from [[H4161]] her lips, [[H8193]] whether her vows [[H5088]] or her [[H5315]] obligation, [[H632]] shall stand. [[H6965]] Her husband [[H376]] has nullified them, [[H6565]] and the LORD [[H3068]] will absolve her. [[H5545]]

### 13
Her husband [[H376]] may confirm [[H6965]] or nullify [[H6565]] any [[H3605]] vow [[H5088]] or any [[H3605]] sworn [[H7621]] pledge [[H632]] to deny [[H6031]] herself. [[H5315]]

### 14
But if [[H518]] her husband [[H376]] says nothing [[H2790]] to her  from day [[H3117]] to [[H413]] day, [[H3117]] then he confirms [[H6965]] all [[H3605]] the vows [[H5088]] and [[H176]] pledges [[H632]] that [[H834]] bind her. [[H5921]] He has confirmed [[H6965]] them, [[H853]] because [[H3588]] he said nothing [[H2790]] to her  on the day [[H3117]] he heard about them. [[H8085]]

### 15
But if [[H518]] he nullifies [[H6565]] them [[H853]] after [[H310]] he hears of them, [[H8085]] then he will bear [[H5375]] her [[H853]] iniquity.” [[H5771]]

### 16
These [[H428]] are the statutes [[H2706]] that [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] commanded [[H6680]] Moses [[H4872]] concerning relationships between [[H996]] a man [[H376]] and his wife, [[H802]] and between [[H996]] a father [[H1]] and a young daughter [[H1323]] still in his [[H1]] home. [[H1004]]
