###### 1
And the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H1696]] to [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]]

###### 2
“Send [[H7971]] men [[H376]] to spy [[H8446]] out the land [[H776]] of Canaan, [[H3667]] which [[H834]] I [[H589]] am giving [[H5414]] to the Israelites. [[H1121]] From each [[H3605]] of their fathers' [[H1]] tribes [[H4294]] send [[H7971]] one [[H259]] man [[H376]] who is a leader [[H5387]] among them.” 

###### 3
So at [[H5921]] the command [[H6310]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] Moses [[H4872]] sent [[H7971]] them out [[H853]] from the wilderness [[H4057]] of Paran. [[H6290]] All [[H3605]] the men [[H376]] were leaders [[H7218]] of the Israelites, [[H3478]]

###### 4
and these [[H428]] were their names: [[H8034]] From the tribe [[H4294]] of Reuben, [[H7205]] Shammua [[H8051]] son [[H1121]] of Zaccur; [[H2139]]

###### 5
from the tribe [[H4294]] of Simeon, [[H8095]] Shaphat [[H8202]] son [[H1121]] of Hori; [[H2753]]

###### 6
from the tribe [[H4294]] of Judah, [[H3063]] Caleb [[H3612]] son [[H1121]] of Jephunneh; [[H3312]]

###### 7
from the tribe [[H4294]] of Issachar, [[H3485]] Igal [[H3008]] son [[H1121]] of Joseph; [[H3130]]

###### 8
from the tribe [[H4294]] of Ephraim, [[H669]] Hoshea [[H1954]] son [[H1121]] of Nun; [[H5126]]

###### 9
from the tribe [[H4294]] of Benjamin, [[H1144]] Palti [[H6406]] son [[H1121]] of Raphu; [[H7505]]

###### 10
from the tribe [[H4294]] of Zebulun, [[H2074]] Gaddiel [[H1427]] son [[H1121]] of Sodi; [[H5476]]

###### 11
from the tribe [[H4294]] of Manasseh [[H4519]] (a tribe [[H4294]] of Joseph), [[H3130]] Gaddi [[H1426]] son [[H1121]] of Susi; [[H5485]]

###### 12
from the tribe [[H4294]] of Dan, [[H1835]] Ammiel [[H5988]] son [[H1121]] of Gemalli; [[H1582]]

###### 13
from the tribe [[H4294]] of Asher, [[H836]] Sethur [[H5639]] son [[H1121]] of Michael; [[H4317]]

###### 14
from the tribe [[H4294]] of Naphtali, [[H5321]] Nahbi [[H5147]] son [[H1121]] of Vophsi; [[H2058]]

###### 15
[and] from the tribe [[H4294]] of Gad, [[H1410]] Geuel [[H1345]] son [[H1121]] of Machi. [[H4352]]

###### 16
These [[H428]] were the names [[H8034]] of the men [[H376]] Moses [[H4872]] sent [[H7971]] to spy out [[H8446]] the land; [[H776]] and Moses [[H4872]] gave [[H7121]] to Hoshea [[H1954]] son [[H1121]] of Nun [[H5126]] {the name} Joshua. [[H3091]]

###### 17
When Moses [[H4872]] sent [[H7971]] them [[H853]] to spy out [[H8446]] the land [[H776]] of Canaan, [[H3667]] he told [[H559]] them, [[H413]] “Go up [[H5927]] through the Negev, [[H5045]] and [[H5927]] into the hill country. [[H2022]]

###### 18
See [[H7200]] what [[H4100]] the land [[H776]] is like [[H1931]] and [[H853]] whether its people [[H5971]] are strong [[H2389]] or weak, [[H7504]] few [[H4592]] or [[H518]] many. [[H7227]]

###### 19
Is the land [[H776]] where [[H834]] they [[H1931]] live [[H3427]] good [[H2896]] or [[H518]] bad? [[H7451]] Are the cities [[H5892]] where [[H834]] they [[H1931]] dwell [[H3427]] open camps [[H4264]] or [[H518]] fortifications? [[H4013]]

###### 20
Is the soil [[H776]] fertile [[H8082]] or [[H518]] unproductive? [[H7330]] Are there [[H3426]] trees [[H6086]] in it  or [[H518]] not? [[H369]] Be courageous, [[H2388]] and bring back [[H3947]] some of the fruit [[H6529]] of the land.” [[H776]] (It was the season [[H3117]] for the first ripe [[H1061]] grapes.) [[H6025]]

###### 21
So they went up [[H5927]] and spied out [[H8446]] the land [[H776]] from the wilderness [[H4057]] of Zin [[H6790]] as [[H5704]] far as Rehob, [[H7340]] toward Lebo-hamath. [[H2574]]

###### 22
They went up [[H5927]] through the Negev [[H5045]] and came [[H935]] to [[H5704]] Hebron, [[H2275]] where [[H8033]] Ahiman, [[H289]] Sheshai, [[H8344]] and Talmai, [[H8526]] the descendants [[H3211]] of Anak, [[H6061]] dwelled. [[H2275]] It had been built [[H1129]] seven [[H7651]] years [[H8141]] before [[H6440]] Zoan [[H6814]] in Egypt. [[H4714]]

###### 23
When they came [[H935]] to [[H5704]] the Valley [[H5158]] of Eshcol, [[H812]] they cut down [[H3772]] a branch [[H2156]] with a single [[H259]] cluster [[H811]] of grapes, [[H6025]] which they carried [[H5375]] on a pole [[H4132]] between two men. [[H8147]] They also took some [[H4480]] pomegranates [[H7416]] and figs. [[H8384]]

###### 24
Because of [[H5921]] the cluster [[H811]] of grapes the Israelites [[H1121]] cut [[H3772]] there, [[H8033]] that [[H1931]] place [[H4725]] was called [[H7121]] the Valley [[H5158]] of Eshcol. [[H812]]

###### 25
After [[H7093]] forty [[H705]] days [[H3117]] [the men] returned [[H7725]] from spying out [[H8446]] the land, [[H776]]

###### 26
and they went back [[H1980]] to [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] Aaron, [[H175]] and the whole [[H3605]] congregation [[H5712]] of Israel [[H3478]] in [[H413]] the Wilderness [[H4057]] of Paran [[H6290]] at Kadesh. [[H6946]] They brought back [[H7725]] a report [[H1697]] for all [[H3605]] the congregation [[H5712]] and showed [[H7200]] them the fruit [[H6529]] of the land. [[H776]]

###### 27
And they gave this account [[H5608]] to [Moses]:  “We went [[H935]] into [[H413]] the land [[H776]] to which [[H834]] you sent us, [[H7971]] and indeed, [[H1571]] it [[H1931]] is flowing [[H2100]] with milk [[H2461]] and honey. [[H1706]] Here is [[H2088]] some of its fruit! [[H6529]]

###### 28
Nevertheless, [[H657]] the people [[H5971]] living [[H3427]] in the land [[H776]] are strong, [[H5794]] and the cities [[H5892]] are large [[H1419]] and fortified. [[H3966]] We even [[H1571]] saw [[H7200]] the descendants [[H3211]] of Anak [[H6061]] there. [[H8033]]

###### 29
The Amalekites [[H6002]] live [[H3427]] in the land [[H776]] of the Negev; [[H5045]] the Hittites, [[H2850]] Jebusites, [[H2983]] and Amorites [[H567]] live [[H3427]] in the hill country; [[H2022]] and the Canaanites [[H3669]] live [[H3427]] by [[H5921]] the sea [[H3220]] and along [[H5921]] the Jordan.” [[H3383]]

###### 30
Then Caleb [[H3612]] quieted [[H2013]] the people [[H5971]] before [[H413]] Moses [[H4872]] and said, [[H559]] “We must go up [[H5927]] and take possession of [[H3423]] [the land], [[H853]] for [[H3588]] we can certainly conquer [[H3201]] it!” [[H3201]]

###### 31
But the men [[H376]] who [[H834]] had gone up [[H5927]] with him [[H5973]] replied, [[H559]] “We cannot [[H3808]] go up [[H5927]] against [[H413]] the people, [[H5971]] for [[H3588]] they [[H1931]] are stronger [[H2389]] than we are!” [[H4480]]

###### 32
So they gave [[H3318]] the Israelites [[H1121]] a bad report [[H1681]] about the land [[H776]] they had spied out: [[H8446]] “The land [[H776]] we explored [[H5674]] devours [[H398]] its inhabitants, [[H3427]] and all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] we saw [[H7200]] there [[H8432]] are great in stature. [[H4060]]

###### 33
We even saw [[H7200]] the Nephilim [[H5303]] there— [[H8033]] the descendants [[H1121]] of Anak [[H6061]] that come from [[H4480]] the Nephilim! [[H5303]] We seemed [[H1961]] like grasshoppers [[H2284]] in our own sight, [[H5869]] and we must have seemed [[H1961]] the same to them!” [[H3651]]
