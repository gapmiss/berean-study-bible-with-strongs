###### 1
David, however, [[H1732]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] himself, [[H3820]] “One [[H259]] of these days [[H3117]] now [[H6258]] I will be swept away [[H5595]] by the hand [[H3027]] of Saul. [[H7586]] There is nothing [[H369]] better [[H2896]] for me  than [[H3588]] to escape [[H4422]] to [[H413]] the land [[H776]] of the Philistines. [[H6430]] Then Saul [[H7586]] will stop [[H2976]] searching [[H1245]] for me [[H4480]] all over [[H3605]] Israel, [[H3478]] and I will slip [[H4422]] out of his hand. [[H3027]]

###### 2
So David [[H1732]] set out [[H6965]] with [[H5973]] his six [[H8337]] hundred [[H3967]] men [[H376]] and went [[H5674]] to [[H413]] Achish [[H397]] son [[H1121]] of Maoch, [[H4582]] the king [[H4428]] of Gath. [[H1661]]

###### 3
David [[H1732]] and his men [[H376]] settled [[H3427]] in Gath [[H1661]] with [[H5973]] Achish, [[H397]] and each man [[H376]] had his family with him. [[H1004]] David [[H1732]] had his two [[H8147]] wives, [[H802]] Ahinoam [[H293]] of Jezreel [[H3159]] and Abigail [[H26]] of Carmel, [[H3762]] the widow [[H802]] of Nabal. [[H5037]]

###### 4
And when Saul [[H7586]] learned [[H5046]] that [[H3588]] David [[H1732]] had fled [[H1272]] to Gath, [[H1661]] he no [[H3808]] longer [[H3254]] searched for him. [[H1245]]

###### 5
Then David [[H1732]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Achish, [[H397]] “If [[H518]] I have found [[H4672]] favor [[H2580]] in your eyes, [[H5869]] let me be assigned [[H5414]] a place [[H4725]] in one [[H259]] of the outlying [[H7704]] towns, [[H5892]] so I can live [[H3427]] there. [[H8033]] For why [[H4100]] should your servant [[H5650]] live [[H3427]] in the royal [[H4467]] city [[H5892]] with you? [[H5973]]

###### 6
That [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] Achish [[H397]] gave [[H5414]] him  Ziklag, [[H6860]] and [[H3651]] to [[H5704]] this [[H2088]] day [[H3117]] [it] [[H6860]] still belongs to [[H1961]] the kings [[H4428]] of Judah. [[H3063]]

###### 7
And the time [[H3117]] that [[H834]] David [[H1732]] lived [[H3427]] in Philistine [[H6430]] territory [[H7704]] amounted to [[H1961]] a year [[H3117]] and four [[H702]] months. [[H2320]]

###### 8
Now David [[H1732]] and his men [[H582]] went up [[H5927]] and raided [[H6584]] the Geshurites, [[H1651]] the Girzites, [[H1511]] and the Amalekites. [[H6003]] (From [[H3588]] ancient times [[H5769]] these people [[H2007]] had inhabited [[H3427]] the land [[H776]] extending to Shur [[H7793]] and [[H5704]] Egypt.) [[H4714]]

###### 9
Whenever David [[H1732]] attacked [[H5221]] a territory, [[H776]] he did not [[H3808]] leave [[H2421]] a man [[H376]] or woman {alive}, [[H802]] but he took [[H3947]] the flocks [[H6629]] and herds, [[H1241]] the donkeys, [[H2543]] camels, [[H1581]] and clothing. [[H899]] Then he would return [[H7725]] to [[H413]] Achish, [[H397]]

###### 10
who [[H397]] would ask him, [[H559]] “What have you raided today?” [[H6584]] And David [[H1732]] would reply, [[H559]] “The Negev [[H5045]] of Judah,” [[H3063]] or [[H5921]] “The Negev [[H5045]] of Jerahmeel,” [[H3397]] or [[H413]] “The Negev [[H5045]] of the Kenites.” [[H7017]]

###### 11
David [[H1732]] did not {leave} [[H3808]] a man [[H376]] or woman [[H802]] alive [[H2421]] to be brought [[H935]] to Gath, [[H1661]] for he said, [[H559]] “Otherwise [[H6435]] they will report [[H5046]] us, [[H5921]] saying, [[H559]] ‘This is what [[H3541]] David [[H1732]] did.’” [[H6213]] And this [[H3541]] was David’s custom [[H4941]] the whole [[H3605]] time [[H3117]] he lived [[H3427]] in Philistine [[H6430]] territory. [[H7704]]

###### 12
So Achish [[H397]] trusted [[H539]] David, [[H1732]] thinking, [[H559]] “Since he has made himself repugnant [[H887]] to his people [[H5971]] Israel, [[H3478]] he will be [[H1961]] my  servant [[H5650]] forever.” [[H5769]]
