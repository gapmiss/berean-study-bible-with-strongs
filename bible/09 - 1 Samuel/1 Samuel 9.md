###### 1
Now there was [[H1961]] a Benjamite, [[H1144]] a powerful man, [[H1368]] whose name [[H8034]] was Kish [[H7027]] son [[H1121]] of Abiel, [[H22]] the son [[H1121]] of Zeror, [[H6872]] the son [[H1121]] of Becorath, [[H1064]] the son [[H1121]] of Aphiah [[H647]] of Benjamin. [[H3227]]

###### 2
And  he had [[H1961]] a son [[H1121]] named [[H8034]] Saul, [[H7586]] choice [[H970]] and handsome, [[H2896]] without equal [[H369]] among [[H4480]] the Israelites— [[H1121]] a head [[H7926]] taller [[H1364]] than any [[H3605]] of the people. [[H5971]]

###### 3
One day the donkeys [[H860]] of Saul’s [[H7586]] father [[H1]] Kish [[H7027]] wandered off. [[H6]] So Kish [[H7027]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] his son [[H1121]] Saul, [[H7586]] “Take [[H3947]] one [[H259]] of the servants [[H5288]] and go [[H1980]] look for [[H1245]] the donkeys.” [[H860]]

###### 4
So [Saul] passed [[H5674]] through the hill country [[H2022]] of Ephraim [[H669]] and then through the land [[H776]] of Shalishah, [[H8031]] but did not [[H3808]] find [the donkeys]. [[H4672]] [He and the servant] went [[H5674]] through the region [[H776]] of Shaalim, [[H8171]] but [they were] not [there]. [[H369]] Then they went [[H5674]] through the land [[H776]] of Benjamin, [[H3227]] and still they did not [[H3808]] find them. [[H4672]]

###### 5
When they [[H1992]] reached [[H935]] the land [[H776]] of Zuph, [[H6689]] Saul [[H7586]] said [[H559]] to his servant, [[H5288]] “Come, [[H1980]] let us go back, [[H7725]] or [[H6435]] my father [[H1]] will stop [worrying] [[H2308]] about [[H4480]] the donkeys [[H860]] and start worrying [[H1672]] about us.” 

###### 6
“Look,” [[H2009]] said the servant, [[H559]] “in this [[H2063]] city [[H5892]] there is a man [[H376]] of God [[H430]] who [[H376]] is highly respected; [[H3513]] everything [[H3605]] he says [[H1696]] surely [[H935]] comes to pass. [[H935]] Let us go [[H1980]] there [[H8033]] now. [[H6258]] Maybe [[H194]] he will tell [[H5046]] us which [[H834]] way [[H1870]] to go.” [[H1980]]

###### 7
“If [[H2009]] we do go,” [[H1980]] Saul [[H7586]] replied, [[H559]] “what [[H4100]] can we give [[H935]] the man? [[H376]] For [[H3588]] the bread [[H3899]] in our packs [[H3627]] is gone, [[H235]] and there is no [[H369]] gift [[H8670]] to take [[H935]] to the man [[H376]] of God. [[H430]] What [[H4100]] do we have?” [[H854]]

###### 8
Again [[H3254]] the servant [[H5288]] answered, [[H6030]] “Look, [[H2009]] I have here [[H4672]] in my hand [[H3027]] a quarter [[H7253]] shekel [[H8255]] of silver. [[H3701]] I will give [[H5414]] it to the man [[H376]] of God, [[H430]] and he will tell [[H5046]] us  our way.” [[H1870]]

###### 9
(Formerly [[H6440]] in Israel, [[H3478]] a man [[H376]] on his way [[H1980]] to inquire [[H1875]] of God [[H430]] would say, [[H559]] “Come, [[H1980]] let us go [[H1980]] to [[H5704]] the seer,” [[H7203]] for [[H3588]] the prophet [[H5030]] of today [[H3117]] was formerly [[H6440]] called [[H7121]] the seer.) [[H7203]]

###### 10
“Good,” [[H2896]] said [[H559]] Saul [[H7586]] to his servant. [[H5288]] “Come, [[H1980]] let us go.” [[H1980]] So they set out [[H1980]] for [[H413]] the city [[H5892]] where [[H8033]] the man [[H376]] of God was. [[H430]]

###### 11
And as they [[H1992]] were climbing [[H5927]] the hill [[H4608]] to the city, [[H5892]] they [[H1992]] met [[H4672]] some young women [[H5291]] coming out [[H3318]] to draw [[H7579]] water [[H4325]] and asked, [[H559]] “Is [[H3426]] the seer here?” [[H7203]]

###### 12
“Yes, [[H2009]] he is [[H3426]] ahead of you,” [[H6440]] they answered. [[H6030]] “Hurry [[H4116]] now, [[H6258]] for [[H3588]] today [[H3117]] he has come [[H935]] to the city [[H5892]] because [[H3588]] the people have [[H5971]] a sacrifice [[H2077]] on the high place. [[H1116]]

###### 13
As soon as you enter [[H935]] the city [[H5892]] you can find [[H4672]] him [[H853]] before [[H2962]] he goes up [[H5927]] to the high place [[H1116]] to eat. [[H398]] The people [[H5971]] will not [[H3808]] eat [[H398]] until [[H5704]] he comes, [[H935]] because [[H3588]] he [[H1931]] must bless [[H1288]] the sacrifice; [[H2077]] after [[H310]] that, [[H3651]] the guests [[H7121]] will eat. [[H398]] Go up [[H5927]] at once; [[H3117]] you will find [[H4672]] him. [[H853]]

###### 14
So Saul and his servant went up [[H5927]] toward the city, [[H5892]] and as they [[H1992]] were entering [[H935]] it, [[H5892]] there was [[H2009]] Samuel [[H8050]] coming [[H3318]] toward them [[H7122]] on his way up [[H5927]] to the high place. [[H1116]]

###### 15
Now on the day [[H3117]] before [[H6440]] Saul’s [[H7586]] arrival, [[H935]] the LORD [[H3068]] had revealed [[H1540]] to Samuel, [[H8050]]

###### 16
“At this time [[H6256]] tomorrow [[H4279]] I will send [[H7971]] you a man [[H376]] from the land [[H776]] of Benjamin, [[H1144]] and you are to anoint him [[H4886]] leader [[H5057]] over [[H5921]] My people [[H5971]] Israel; [[H3478]] he will deliver [[H3467]] them [[H5971]] from the hand [[H3027]] of the Philistines. [[H6430]] For [[H3588]] I have looked upon [[H7200]] My people, [[H5971]] because [[H3588]] their cry [[H6818]] has come [[H935]] to Me. [[H413]]

###### 17
When Samuel [[H8050]] saw [[H7200]] Saul, [[H7586]] the LORD [[H3068]] told him, [[H6030]] “Here [[H2009]] is the man [[H376]] of whom [[H834]] I spoke; [[H559]] he [[H2088]] shall rule [[H6113]] over My people.” [[H5971]]

###### 18
Saul [[H7586]] approached [[H5066]] Samuel [[H8050]] in the gateway [[H8179]] and asked, [[H559]] “Would you please [[H4994]] tell [[H5046]] me  where [[H335]] the seer's [[H7203]] house [is]?” [[H1004]]

###### 19
“I [[H595]] am the seer,” [[H7203]] Samuel [[H8050]] replied. [[H6030]] “Go up [[H5927]] before me [[H6440]] to the high place, [[H1116]] for you shall eat [[H398]] with me [[H5973]] today. [[H3117]] And when I send you off [[H7971]] in the morning, [[H1242]] I will tell [[H5046]] you  all [[H3605]] that is [[H834]] in your heart. [[H3824]]

###### 20
As for the donkeys [[H860]] you lost [[H6]] three [[H7969]] days [[H3117]] ago, [[H3117]] do not [[H408]] worry [[H7760]] about them,  for [[H3588]] they have been found. [[H4672]] And upon whom [is] [[H4310]] all [[H3605]] the desire [[H2532]] of Israel, [[H3478]] if not [[H3808]] upon you  and on all [[H3605]] your father's [[H1]] house?” [[H1004]]

###### 21
Saul [[H7586]] replied, [[H6030]] “Am I [[H595]] not [[H3808]] a Benjamite [[H1145]] from the smallest [[H6996]] tribe [[H7626]] of Israel, [[H3478]] and is not my clan [[H4940]] the least [[H6810]] of all [[H3605]] the clans [[H4940]] of Benjamin? [[H1144]] So why [[H4100]] would you say [[H1696]] such a thing [[H1697]] to me?” [[H413]]

###### 22
Then Samuel [[H8050]] took [[H3947]] Saul [[H7586]] and [[H853]] his servant, [[H5288]] brought them [[H935]] into the hall, [[H3957]] and seated [[H5414]] them  in the place [[H4725]] of honor [[H7218]] among those who were invited— [[H7121]] about thirty [[H7970]] in all. [[H376]]

###### 23
And Samuel [[H8050]] said [[H559]] to the cook, [[H2876]] “Bring [[H5414]] the portion [[H4490]] I gave [[H5414]] you  and told [[H559]] you to set [[H7760]] aside.” [[H5973]]

###### 24
So the cook [[H2876]] picked up [[H7311]] the leg [[H7785]] and what was attached to it [[H5921]] and set [it] [[H7760]] before [[H6440]] Saul. [[H7586]] Then Samuel said, [[H559]] “Here is [[H2009]] what was kept back. [[H7604]] [It] was set apart [[H7760]] for you. [[H6440]] Eat, [[H398]] for [[H3588]] it has been kept [[H8104]] for you  for this occasion, [[H4150]] from the time I said, [[H559]] ‘I have invited [[H7121]] the people. [[H5971]] So Saul [[H7586]] dined [[H398]] with [[H5973]] Samuel [[H8050]] that [[H1931]] day. [[H3117]]

###### 25
And after they had come down [[H3381]] from the high place [[H1116]] into the city, [[H5892]] Samuel spoke [[H1696]] with [[H5973]] Saul [[H7586]] on [[H5921]] the roof of his house. [[H1406]]

###### 26
They got up early in the morning, [[H7925]] and just before [[H5927]] dawn [[H7837]] Samuel [[H8050]] called [[H7121]] to [[H413]] Saul [[H7586]] on the roof, [[H1406]] “Get ready, [[H6965]] and I will send you on your way!” [[H7971]] So Saul [[H7586]] arose, [[H6965]] and both [[H8147]] he [[H1931]] and Samuel [[H8050]] went [[H3318]] outside together. [[H2351]]

###### 27
As they [[H1992]] were going down [[H3381]] to the edge [[H7097]] of the city, [[H5892]] Samuel [[H8050]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Saul, [[H7586]] “Tell [[H559]] the servant [[H5288]] to go on [[H5674]] ahead of us, [[H6440]] but you [[H859]] stay [[H5975]] for a while, [[H3117]] and I will reveal to you [[H8085]] the word [[H1697]] of God.” [[H430]] So the servant went on.
