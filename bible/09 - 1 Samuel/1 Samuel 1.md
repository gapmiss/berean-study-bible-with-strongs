###### 1
Now there was [[H1961]] a [[H259]] man [[H376]] named [[H8034]] Elkanah [[H511]] [who was] from [[H4480]] Ramathaim-zophim [[H7436]] in the hill country [[H2022]] of Ephraim. [[H669]] [He was] the son [[H1121]] of Jeroham, [[H3395]] the son [[H1121]] of Elihu, [[H453]] the son [[H1121]] of Tohu, [[H8459]] the son [[H1121]] of Zuph, [[H6689]] an Ephraimite. [[H673]]

###### 2
He had  two [[H8147]] wives, [[H802]] one [[H259]] named [[H8034]] Hannah [[H2584]] and the other [[H8145]] Peninnah. [[H6444]] And Peninnah [[H6444]] had [[H1961]] children, [[H3206]] but Hannah [[H2584]] had none. [[H369]]

###### 3
Year after year [[H3117]] [Elkanah] [[H1931]] would go up [[H5927]] from his city [[H5892]] to worship [[H7812]] and sacrifice [[H2076]] to the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts [[H6635]] at Shiloh, [[H7887]] where [[H8033]] Eli’s [[H5941]] two [[H8147]] sons, [[H1121]] Hophni [[H2652]] and Phinehas, [[H6372]] were priests [[H3548]] to the LORD. [[H3068]]

###### 4
And whenever the day [[H3117]] came [[H1961]] for Elkanah [[H511]] to present his sacrifice, [[H2076]] he would give [[H5414]] portions [[H4490]] to his wife [[H802]] Peninnah [[H6444]] and to all [[H3605]] her sons [[H1121]] and daughters. [[H1323]]

###### 5
But to Hannah [[H2584]] he would give [[H5414]] a [[H259]] double [[H639]] portion, [[H4490]] for [[H3588]] he loved [[H157]] her [[H2584]] even though the LORD [[H3068]] had closed [[H5462]] her womb. [[H7358]]

###### 6
Because [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] had closed [[H5462]] [Hannah's] womb, [[H7358]] her rival [[H6869]] would provoke her [[H7481]] and taunt her [[H3707]] severely. [[H3708]]

###### 7
And this went on [[H3651]] year [[H8141]] after year. [[H8141]] Whenever [[H1767]] [Hannah] went up [[H5927]] to the house [[H1004]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] her rival taunted her [[H3707]] until she wept [[H1058]] and would not [[H3808]] eat. [[H398]]

###### 8
“Hannah, [[H2584]] why [[H4100]] are you crying?” [[H1058]] her husband [[H376]] Elkanah [[H511]] asked. [[H559]] “Why [[H4100]] won't you [[H3808]] eat? [[H398]] Why [[H4100]] is your heart [[H3824]] so grieved? [[H3415]] Am I [[H595]] not [[H3808]] better [[H2896]] to you  than ten [[H6235]] sons?” [[H1121]]

###### 9
So after [[H310]] they had finished eating [[H398]] and drinking [[H8354]] in Shiloh, [[H7887]] Hannah [[H2584]] got up. [[H6965]] Now Eli [[H5941]] the priest [[H3548]] was sitting [[H3427]] on [[H5921]] a chair [[H3678]] by [[H5921]] the doorpost [[H4201]] of the temple [[H1964]] of the LORD. [[H3068]]

###### 10
In her bitter distress, [[H4751]] Hannah prayed [[H6419]] to [[H5921]] the LORD [[H3068]] and wept [[H1058]] with many tears. [[H1058]]

###### 11
And she made [[H5087]] a vow, [[H5088]] pleading, [[H559]] “O LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts, [[H6635]] if [[H518]] only [[H7200]] You will look [[H7200]] upon the affliction [[H6040]] of Your maidservant [[H519]] and remember me, [[H2142]] not [[H3808]] forgetting [Your maidservant] [[H7911]] but giving [[H5414]] [her] [[H519]] a son, [[H2233]] then I will dedicate him [[H5414]] to the LORD [[H3068]] all [[H3605]] the days [[H3117]] of his life, [[H2416]] and no [[H3808]] razor [[H4177]] shall ever come [[H5927]] over [[H5921]] his head. [[H7218]]

###### 12
As [[H3588]] [Hannah] kept on [[H7235]] praying [[H6419]] before [[H6440]] the LORD, [[H3068]] Eli [[H5941]] watched [[H8104]] her mouth. [[H6310]]

###### 13
Hannah [[H2584]] was praying [[H1696]] in [[H5921]] her heart, [[H3820]] and though [[H7535]] her lips [[H8193]] were moving, [[H5128]] her voice [[H6963]] could not [[H3808]] be heard. [[H8085]] So Eli [[H5941]] thought [[H2803]] she was drunk [[H7910]]

###### 14
and said [[H559]] to her, [[H413]] “How [[H5704]] long [[H4970]] will you be drunk? [[H7937]] Put away [[H5493]] your wine!” [[H3196]]

###### 15
“No, [[H3808]] my lord,” [[H113]] Hannah [[H2584]] replied. [[H6030]] “I [[H595]] am a woman [[H802]] oppressed [[H7186]] in spirit. [[H7307]] I have not [[H3808]] had [[H8354]] any wine [[H3196]] or strong drink, [[H7941]] but I have poured out [[H8210]] my soul [[H5315]] before [[H6440]] the LORD. [[H3068]]

###### 16
Do not [[H408]] take [[H5414]] your servant [[H519]] for a wicked [[H1100]] woman; [[H1323]] for all this time [[H5704]] I have been praying [[H1696]] out of the depth [[H7230]] of my anguish [[H7879]] and grief.” [[H3708]]

###### 17
“Go [[H1980]] in peace,” [[H7965]] Eli [[H5941]] replied, [[H6030]] “and may the God [[H430]] of Israel [[H3478]] grant [[H5414]] the petition [[H7596]] you have asked [[H7592]] of Him.” [[H5973]]

###### 18
“May your maidservant [[H8198]] find [[H4672]] favor [[H2580]] with you,” [[H5869]] said Hannah. [[H559]] Then [she] [[H802]] went [[H1980]] on her way, [[H1870]] eating [[H398]] and no [[H3808]] longer [[H5750]] downcast. [[H6440]]

###### 19
The next morning [[H1242]] Elkanah and Hannah got up early [[H7925]] to bow in worship [[H7812]] before [[H6440]] the LORD, [[H3068]] and then returned [[H7725]] home [[H1004]] to Ramah. [[H7414]] And Elkanah [[H511]] had relations with [[H3045]] his wife [[H802]] Hannah, [[H2584]] and the LORD [[H3068]] remembered her. [[H2142]]

###### 20
So [[H1961]] in the course [[H8622]] of time, [[H3117]] Hannah [[H2584]] conceived [[H2029]] and gave birth to [[H3205]] a son. [[H1121]] She named [[H7121]] him [[H8034]] Samuel, [[H8050]] [saying,] “Because [[H3588]] I have asked for him [[H7592]] from the LORD.” [[H3068]]

###### 21
Then Elkanah [[H511]] and all [[H3605]] his house [[H1004]] went up [[H5927]] to make [[H2076]] the annual [[H3117]] sacrifice [[H2077]] to the LORD [[H3068]] and [to fulfill] [[H853]] his vow, [[H5088]]

###### 22
but Hannah [[H2584]] did not [[H3808]] go. [[H5927]] “After [[H5704]] the boy [[H5288]] is weaned,” [[H1580]] she said [[H559]] to her husband, [[H376]] “I will take [[H935]] him to appear [[H7200]] before [[H6440]] the LORD [[H3068]] and to stay [[H3427]] there [[H8033]] always.” [[H5704]]

###### 23
“Do [[H6213]] what you think [[H5869]] is best,” [[H2896]] her husband [[H376]] Elkanah [[H511]] replied, [[H559]] “and stay [[H3427]] here until [[H5704]] you have weaned him. [[H1580]] Only [[H389]] may the LORD [[H3068]] confirm [[H6965]] His word.” [[H1697]] So Hannah [[H802]] stayed [[H3427]] and nursed [[H3243]] her son [[H1121]] until [[H5704]] she had weaned [[H1580]] him. [[H853]]

###### 24
Once [[H834]] she had weaned him, [[H1580]] [Hannah] took [the boy] [[H5927]] with her, [[H5973]] along with a three-year-old [[H7969]] bull, [[H6499]] an ephah [[H374]] of flour, [[H7058]] and a skin [[H5035]] of wine. [[H3196]] Though the boy [[H5288]] was still young, [[H5288]] she brought him [[H935]] to the house [[H1004]] of the LORD [[H3068]] at Shiloh. [[H7887]]

###### 25
And when they had slaughtered [[H7819]] the bull, [[H6499]] they brought [[H935]] the boy [[H5288]] to [[H413]] Eli. [[H5941]]

###### 26
“Please, [[H994]] my lord,” [[H113]] said [Hannah], [[H559]] “as surely as you [[H5315]] live, [[H2416]] my lord, [[H113]] I [[H589]] am the woman [[H802]] who stood [[H5324]] here [[H2088]] beside [[H5973]] you praying [[H6419]] to [[H413]] the LORD. [[H3068]]

###### 27
I prayed [[H6419]] for [[H413]] this [[H2088]] boy, [[H5288]] and since the LORD [[H3068]] has granted me [[H5414]] what [[H834]] I asked [[H7592]] of Him, [[H5973]]

###### 28
I [[H595]] now [[H1571]] dedicate the boy [[H7592]] to the LORD. [[H3068]] For as [[H3605]] long as he lives, [[H1961]] he [[H1931]] is dedicated [[H7592]] to the LORD.” [[H3068]] So they worshiped [[H7812]] the LORD [[H3068]] there. [[H8033]]
