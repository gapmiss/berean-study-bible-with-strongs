### 1
So David [[H1732]] left [[H1980]] [Gath] [[H8033]] and took refuge [[H4422]] in [[H413]] the cave [[H4631]] of Adullam. [[H5725]] When his brothers [[H251]] and the rest of [[H3605]] his father's [[H1]] household [[H1004]] heard about it, [[H8085]] they went down [[H3381]] to him [[H413]] there. [[H8033]]

### 2
And all [[H3605]] who were distressed [[H4689]] [or] [[H3605]] indebted [[H5378]] or discontented [[H4751]] rallied [[H6908]] around him, [[H413]] and he became [[H1961]] their [[H5921]] leader. [[H8269]] About four [[H702]] hundred [[H3967]] men [[H376]] were [[H1961]] with him. [[H5973]]

### 3
From there [[H8033]] David [[H1732]] went [[H1980]] to Mizpeh [[H4708]] of Moab, [[H4124]] where he said [[H559]] to [[H413]] the king [[H4428]] of Moab, [[H4124]] “Please [[H4994]] let my father [[H1]] and mother [[H517]] stay [[H3318]] with you [[H854]] until [[H834]] I learn [[H3045]] what [[H4100]] God [[H430]] will do [[H6213]] for me.” 

### 4
So he left [[H5148]] them in [[H854]] the care [[H6440]] of the king [[H4428]] of Moab, [[H4124]] and they stayed [[H3427]] with [[H5973]] him the whole [[H3605]] time [[H3117]] David [[H1732]] was [[H1961]] in the stronghold. [[H4686]]

### 5
Then the prophet [[H5030]] Gad [[H1410]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] David, [[H1732]] “Do not [[H3808]] stay [[H3427]] in the stronghold. [[H4686]] Depart [[H1980]] and go [[H935]] into the land [[H776]] of Judah.” [[H3063]] So David [[H1732]] left [[H1980]] and went [[H935]] to the forest [[H3293]] of Hereth. [[H2802]]

### 6
Soon Saul [[H7586]] learned [[H8085]] that [[H3588]] David [[H1732]] and his men [[H834]] had been discovered. [[H3045]] At that time, Saul [[H7586]] was in Gibeah, [[H1390]] sitting [[H3427]] under [[H8478]] the tamarisk tree [[H815]] on the hill at Gibeah, [[H7413]] with his spear [[H2595]] in his hand [[H3027]] and all [[H3605]] his servants [[H5650]] standing [[H5324]] around him. [[H5921]]

### 7
Then Saul [[H7586]] said [[H559]] to his servants, [[H5650]] “Listen, [[H8085]] men [[H1121]] of Benjamin! [[H3227]] Is the son [[H1121]] of Jesse [[H3448]] giving [[H5414]] all [[H3605]] of you fields [[H7704]] and vineyards [[H3754]] [and] making [[H7760]] you [[H3605]] commanders [[H8269]] of thousands [[H505]] [or] [[H8269]] hundreds? [[H3967]]

### 8
Is that why all [[H3605]] of you have conspired [[H7194]] against me? [[H5921]] Not one [of you] [[H369]] told [[H1540]] me that [[H241]] my own son [[H1121]] had made a covenant [[H3772]] with [[H5973]] Jesse’s [[H3448]] son. [[H1121]] Not one [[H369]] of you [[H4480]] has shown concern [[H2470]] for me [[H5921]] or revealed [[H1540]] to me [[H241]] that [[H3588]] my son [[H1121]] has stirred up [[H6965]] my own servant [[H5650]] to lie in wait [[H693]] against me, [[H5921]] as is the case today. [[H3117]]

### 9
But Doeg [[H1673]] the Edomite, [[H130]] who [[H1931]] had stationed himself [[H5324]] with [[H5921]] Saul’s [[H7586]] servants, [[H5650]] answered: [[H6030]] “I saw [[H7200]] the son [[H1121]] of Jesse [[H3448]] come [[H935]] to [[H413]] Ahimelech [[H288]] son [[H1121]] of Ahitub [[H285]] at Nob. [[H5011]]

### 10
Ahimelech inquired [[H7592]] of the LORD [[H3068]] for him  and gave [[H5414]] him  provisions. [[H6720]] He also gave [[H5414]] him  the sword [[H2719]] of Goliath [[H1555]] the Philistine.” [[H6430]]

### 11
Then the king [[H4428]] sent [[H7971]] messengers to summon [[H7121]] Ahimelech [[H288]] the priest, [[H3548]] the son [[H1121]] of Ahitub, [[H285]] and his father’s [[H1]] whole [[H3605]] family, [[H1004]] who [[H834]] were priests [[H3548]] at Nob. [[H5011]] And all [[H3605]] of them came [[H935]] to [[H413]] the king. [[H4428]]

### 12
“Listen [[H8085]] now, [[H4994]] son [[H1121]] of Ahitub,” [[H285]] said [[H559]] Saul. [[H7586]] “Here I am, [[H2005]] my lord,” [[H113]] he replied. [[H559]]

### 13
And Saul [[H7586]] asked [[H559]] him, [[H413]] “Why [[H4100]] have you [[H859]] and the son [[H1121]] of Jesse [[H3448]] conspired [[H7194]] against me? [[H5921]] You gave [[H5414]] him  bread [[H3899]] and a sword [[H2719]] and inquired [[H7592]] of God [[H430]] for him  so that he could rise up [[H6965]] against me [[H413]] to lie in wait, [[H693]] as he is doing today.” [[H3117]]

### 14
Ahimelech [[H288]] answered [[H6030]] the king, [[H4428]] “Who [[H4310]] among all [[H3605]] your servants [[H5650]] is as faithful [[H539]] as David, [[H1732]] the king’s [[H4428]] son-in-law, [[H2860]] captain [[H5493]] of [[H413]] your bodyguard, [[H4928]] [who is] honored [[H3513]] in your house? [[H1004]]

### 15
Was that day [[H3117]] the first [[H2490]] time I inquired [[H7592]] of God [[H430]] for him? [[H7592]] Far be it [[H2486]] from me!  Let not [[H408]] the king [[H4428]] accuse [[H7760]] your servant [[H5650]] or any [[H3605]] of my father’s [[H1]] household, [[H1004]] for [[H3588]] your servant [[H5650]] knew [[H3045]] nothing [[H3808]] of this [[H2063]] whole [[H3605]] affair [[H1697]] not in part [[H6996]] or [[H176]] in whole. [[H1419]]

### 16
But the king [[H4428]] replied, [[H559]] “You will surely die, [[H4191]] Ahimelech, [[H288]] you [[H859]] and all [[H3605]] your father's [[H1]] house!” [[H1004]]

### 17
Then the king [[H4428]] ordered [[H559]] the guards [[H7323]] at his side, [[H5324]] “Turn [[H5437]] and kill [[H4191]] the priests [[H3548]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] because [[H3588]] they too [[H1571]] sided with [[H5973]] David. [[H1732]] For [[H3588]] they knew [[H3045]] he [[H1931]] was fleeing, [[H1272]] but they did not [[H3808]] tell [[H1540]] me.” [[H241]] But the king’s [[H4428]] servants [[H5650]] would [[H14]] not [[H3808]] lift [[H7971]] a hand [[H3027]] to strike [[H6293]] the priests [[H3548]] of the LORD. [[H3068]]

### 18
So the king [[H4428]] ordered [[H559]] Doeg, [[H1673]] “You [[H859]] turn [[H5437]] and strike down [[H6293]] the priests!” [[H3548]] And Doeg [[H1673]] the Edomite [[H130]] turned [[H5437]] and struck down [[H6293]] the priests [[H3548]] himself. [[H1931]] On that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] he killed [[H4191]] eighty-five [[H8084]] men [[H376]] who wore [[H5375]] the linen [[H906]] ephod. [[H646]]

### 19
He also put [[H5221]] to the sword [[H2719]] Nob, [[H5011]] the city [[H5892]] of the priests, [[H3548]] with its men [[H376]] and [[H5704]] women, [[H802]] children [[H5768]] and [[H5704]] infants, [[H3243]] oxen, [[H7794]] donkeys, [[H2543]] and sheep. [[H7716]]

### 20
But one [[H259]] of the sons [[H1121]] of Ahimelech [[H288]] son [[H1121]] of Ahitub [[H285]] escaped. [[H4422]] His name [[H8034]] was Abiathar, [[H54]] and he fled [[H1272]] to [[H310]] David. [[H1732]]

### 21
And Abiathar [[H54]] told [[H5046]] David [[H1732]] that [[H3588]] Saul [[H7586]] had killed [[H2026]] the priests [[H3548]] of the LORD. [[H3068]]

### 22
Then David [[H1732]] said [[H559]] to Abiathar, [[H54]] “I knew [[H3045]] that Doeg [[H1673]] the Edomite [[H130]] was there [[H8033]] that [[H1931]] day, [[H3117]] and that [[H3588]] he was sure [[H5046]] to tell [[H5046]] Saul. [[H7586]] I myself [[H595]] am responsible [[H5437]] for the lives [[H5315]] of everyone [[H3605]] in your father’s [[H1]] house. [[H1004]]

### 23
Stay [[H3427]] with me; [[H854]] do not [[H408]] be afraid, [[H3372]] for [[H3588]] he who [[H834]] seeks [[H1245]] your life [[H5315]] is seeking [[H1245]] mine [as well]. [[H5315]] You [[H859]] will be safe [[H4931]] with me.” [[H5978]]
