### 1
Then David [[H1732]] came [[H935]] to Nob, [[H5011]] to [[H413]] Ahimelech [[H288]] the priest. [[H3548]] And when Ahimelech [[H288]] met [[H7122]] David, [[H1732]] he trembled [[H2729]] and asked [[H559]] him,  “Why [are] [[H4069]] you [[H859]] alone? [[H905]] Why is [[H376]] no one [[H369]] with you?” [[H854]]

### 2
“The king [[H4428]] has ordered me [[H6680]] on some business,” [[H1697]] David [[H1732]] replied. [[H559]] “He told [[H559]] me [[H413]] no one [[H408]] is to know [[H3045]] about [[H853]] the mission [[H1697]] or [[H834]] instructions. [[H6680]] And [[H853]] I have directed [[H3045]] [my] young men [[H5288]] to meet me [[H413]] at a certain place. [[H4725]]

### 3
Now then, [[H6258]] what [[H4100]] do you have [[H3426]] on [[H8478]] hand? [[H3027]] Give [me] [[H5414]] five [loaves of] [[H2568]] bread, [[H3899]] or [[H176]] whatever can be found.” [[H4672]]

### 4
“[There is] no [[H369]] common [[H2455]] bread [[H3899]] on [[H8478]] hand,” [[H3027]] the priest [[H3548]] replied, [[H6030]] “but [[H518]] there is some [[H3426]] consecrated [[H6944]] bread— [[H3899]] provided that [[H518]] the young men [[H5288]] have kept themselves [[H8104]] from women.” [[H802]]

### 5
David [[H1732]] answered, [[H6030]] “Women [have] [[H802]] indeed [[H518]] [been] kept [[H6113]] from us,  as usual [[H8032]] when I set out. [[H3318]] And [[H1961]] the equipment [[H3627]] of the young men [[H5288]] is holy, [[H6944]] as it [is] [[H1931]] even on common [[H2455]] missions, [[H1870]] and all the more [[H637]] at [[H3588]] this time.” [[H3117]]

### 6
So the priest [[H3548]] gave [[H5414]] him  the consecrated [bread], [[H6944]] since [[H3588]] there was [[H1961]] no [[H3808]] bread [[H3899]] there [[H8033]] but [[H518]] the bread of the Presence, [[H6440]] which had been removed [[H5493]] from before [[H6440]] the LORD [[H3068]] and replaced with [[H7760]] hot [[H2527]] bread [[H3899]] on the day [[H3117]] it was taken away. [[H3947]]

### 7
Now one [[H376]] of Saul's [[H7586]] servants [[H5650]] was there [[H8033]] that [[H1931]] day, [[H3117]] detained [[H6113]] before [[H6440]] the LORD. [[H3069]] And his name [was] [[H8034]] Doeg [[H1673]] the Edomite, [[H130]] the chief [[H47]] shepherd [[H7473]] for [[H834]] Saul. [[H7586]]

### 8
Then David [[H1732]] asked [[H559]] Ahimelech, [[H288]] “Is there [[H3426]] not [[H371]] a spear [[H2595]] or [[H176]] sword [[H2719]] on [[H8478]] hand [[H3027]] here? [[H6311]] For [[H1571]] I have brought [[H3947]] neither [[H3808]] my sword [[H2719]] nor [[H1571]] my weapons [[H3627]] with me, [[H3027]] because [[H3588]] the king's [[H4428]] business [[H1697]] was [[H1961]] urgent. [[H5169]]

### 9
The priest [[H3548]] replied, [[H559]] “The sword [[H2719]] of Goliath [[H1555]] the Philistine, [[H6430]] whom [[H834]] you killed [[H5221]] in the Valley [[H6010]] of Elah, [[H425]] is here; [[H2009]] it [is] [[H1931]] wrapped [[H3874]] in a cloth [[H8071]] behind [[H310]] the ephod. [[H646]] If [[H518]] you want, [[H853]] you may take. [[H3947]] For [[H3588]] [there is] no [[H369]] other [[H312]] but this one. [[H2108]] And David [[H1732]] said, [[H559]] “[There is] none [[H369]] like it; [[H3644]] give it [[H5414]] to me. 

### 10
That [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] David [[H1732]] fled [[H1272]] from [[H6440]] Saul [[H7586]] and went [[H935]] to [[H413]] Achish [[H397]] king of [[H4428]] Gath. [[H1661]]

### 11
But the servants [[H5650]] of Achish [[H397]] said [[H559]] to him, [[H413]] “[Is] this [[H2088]] not [[H3808]] David, [[H1732]] the king [[H4428]] of the land? [[H776]] Did they not [[H3808]] sing [[H6030]] about him [[H2088]] in their dances, [[H4246]] saying: [[H559]] ‘Saul [[H7586]] has slain [[H5221]] [his] thousands, [[H505]] and David [[H1732]] [his] tens of thousands’?” [[H7233]]

### 12
Now David [[H1732]] took [[H7760]] words [[H1697]] these [[H428]] to heart [[H3824]] and was very much [[H3966]] afraid [[H3372]] of [[H6440]] Achish [[H397]] the king [[H4428]] of Gath. [[H1661]]

### 13
So he changed [[H8138]] his behavior [[H2940]] before them [[H5869]] and feigned madness [[H1984]] in their hands; [[H3027]] he scratched [[H8427]] on [[H5921]] the doors [[H1817]] of the gate [[H8179]] and let his saliva run down [[H3381]] his beard. [[H2206]]

### 14
Then Achish [[H397]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] his servants, [[H5650]] “Look, [[H2009]] you can see [[H7200]] the man [[H376]] is insane! [[H7696]] Why [[H4100]] have you brought [[H935]] him [[H853]] to me? [[H413]]

### 15
Am I [[H589]] in need of [[H2638]] madmen, [[H7696]] that [[H3588]] you have brought [[H935]] this man [[H2088]] to rave [[H7696]] in my presence? [[H5921]] Must this [man] [[H2088]] come [[H935]] into [[H413]] my house?” [[H1004]]
