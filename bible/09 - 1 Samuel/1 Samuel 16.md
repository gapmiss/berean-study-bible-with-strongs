###### 1
Now the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Samuel, [[H8050]] “How long [[H5704]] are you [[H859]] going to mourn [[H56]] for [[H413]] Saul, [[H7586]] since I [[H589]] have rejected him [[H3988]] as king [[H4427]] over [[H5921]] Israel? [[H3478]] Fill your horn [[H7161]] with [[H4390]] oil [[H8081]] and go. [[H1980]] I am sending [[H7971]] you to [[H413]] Jesse [[H3448]] of Bethlehem, [[H1022]] for [[H3588]] I have selected [[H7200]] from his sons [[H1121]] a king [[H4428]] for Myself. 

###### 2
“How [[H349]] can I go?” [[H1980]] Samuel [[H8050]] asked. [[H559]] “Saul [[H7586]] will hear of it [[H8085]] and kill me!” [[H2026]] The LORD [[H3068]] answered, [[H559]] “Take [[H3947]] a heifer [[H1241]] with you [[H3027]] and say, [[H559]] ‘I have come [[H935]] to sacrifice [[H2076]] to the LORD.’ [[H3068]]

###### 3
Then invite [[H7121]] Jesse [[H3448]] to the sacrifice, [[H2077]] and I [[H595]] will show you [[H3045]] what [[H834]] you are to do. [[H6213]] You are to anoint [[H4886]] for Me  the one [[H834]] I indicate.” [[H559]]

###### 4
So Samuel [[H8050]] did [[H6213]] what [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] had said [[H1696]] and went [[H935]] to Bethlehem. [[H1035]] When the elders [[H2205]] of the town [[H5892]] met him, [[H7122]] they trembled [[H2729]] and asked, [[H559]] “Do you come [[H935]] in peace?” [[H7965]]

###### 5
“In peace,” [[H7965]] he replied. [[H559]] “I have come [[H935]] to sacrifice [[H2076]] to the LORD. [[H3068]] Consecrate yourselves [[H6942]] and come [[H935]] with me [[H854]] to the sacrifice.” [[H2077]] Then he consecrated [[H6942]] Jesse [[H3448]] and his sons [[H1121]] and invited [[H7121]] them  to the sacrifice. [[H2077]]

###### 6
When they arrived, [[H935]] Samuel saw [[H7200]] Eliab [[H446]] and said, [[H559]] “Surely [[H389]] here before [[H5048]] the LORD [[H3068]] [is His] anointed.” [[H4899]]

###### 7
But the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Samuel, [[H8050]] “Do not [[H408]] look [[H5027]] at [[H413]] his appearance [[H4758]] or height, [[H1364]] for [[H3588]] I have rejected him; [[H3988]] [the LORD does] not [see] [[H3808]] as [[H834]] man [[H120]] does. [[H7200]] For [[H3588]] man [[H120]] sees [[H7200]] the outward appearance, [[H5869]] but the LORD [[H3068]] sees [[H7200]] the heart. [[H3824]]

###### 8
Then Jesse [[H3448]] called [[H7121]] Abinadab [[H41]] and presented [[H5674]] him to [[H6440]] Samuel, [[H8050]] who said, [[H559]] “The LORD [[H3068]] has not [[H3808]] chosen [[H977]] this [[H2088]] one either.” [[H1571]]

###### 9
Next Jesse [[H3448]] presented [[H5674]] Shammah, [[H8048]] but Samuel said, [[H559]] “The LORD [[H3068]] has not [[H3808]] chosen [[H977]] this [[H2088]] one either.” [[H1571]]

###### 10
Thus Jesse [[H3448]] made seven [[H7651]] of his sons [[H1121]] pass [[H5674]] before [[H6440]] Samuel, [[H8050]] but Samuel [[H8050]] told [[H559]] him, [[H3448]] “The LORD [[H3068]] has not [[H3808]] chosen [[H977]] any of these.” [[H428]]

###### 11
And Samuel [[H8050]] asked [[H559]] him, [[H3448]] “Are these all [[H8552]] the sons you have?” [[H5288]] “There is still [[H5750]] the youngest,” [[H6996]] Jesse replied, [[H559]] “but he is [[H2009]] tending [[H7462]] the sheep.” [[H6629]] “Send for [[H7971]] him,” [[H3947]] Samuel [[H8050]] replied. [[H559]] “For [[H3588]] we will not [[H3808]] sit down [to eat] [[H5437]] until [[H5704]] he arrives.” [[H935]]

###### 12
So Jesse sent for [his youngest son] [[H7971]] and brought him in. [[H935]] He [[H1931]] [was] ruddy, [[H132]] with beautiful [[H3303]] eyes [[H5869]] and a handsome [[H2896]] appearance. [[H7210]] And the LORD [[H3068]] said, [[H559]] “Rise [[H6965]] [and] anoint him, [[H4886]] for [[H3588]] he [[H1931]] is the one.” [[H2088]]

###### 13
So Samuel [[H8050]] took [[H3947]] the horn [[H7161]] of oil [[H8081]] and anointed [[H4886]] him [[H853]] in the presence [[H7130]] of his brothers, [[H251]] and the Spirit [[H7307]] of the LORD [[H3068]] rushed [[H6743]] upon [[H413]] David [[H1732]] from that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] forward. [[H4605]] Then Samuel [[H8050]] set out [[H6965]] and went [[H1980]] to Ramah. [[H7414]]

###### 14
After the Spirit [[H7307]] of the LORD [[H3068]] had departed [[H5493]] from [[H5973]] Saul, [[H7586]] a spirit [[H7307]] of distress [[H7451]] from [[H853]] the LORD [[H3068]] began to torment him. [[H1204]]

###### 15
Saul's [[H7586]] servants [[H5650]] said [[H559]] to him, [[H413]] “Surely [[H2009]] a spirit [[H7307]] of distress [[H7451]] from God [[H430]] is tormenting you. [[H1204]]

###### 16
Let our lord [[H113]] command [[H559]] your servants [[H5650]] here [[H6440]] to seek out [[H1245]] someone [[H376]] who can skillfully [[H3045]] play [[H5059]] the harp. [[H3658]] Whenever [[H1961]] the spirit [[H7307]] of distress [[H7451]] from God [[H430]] is upon you, [[H5921]] he is to play it, [[H5059]] and you  [will be] well.” [[H2895]]

###### 17
And Saul [[H7586]] commanded [[H559]] his servants, [[H5650]] “Find [[H7200]] me  someone [[H376]] who plays [[H5059]] well, [[H3190]] and bring [[H935]] him to me.” [[H413]]

###### 18
One [[H259]] of the servants [[H5288]] answered, [[H6030]] “I have seen [[H7200]] a son [[H1121]] of Jesse [[H3448]] of Bethlehem [[H1022]] who knows [[H3045]] how to play [the harp]. [[H5059]] He is a mighty [[H1368]] man of valor, [[H2428]] a warrior, [[H376]] eloquent [[H995]] and handsome, [[H8389]] and the LORD [[H3068]] is with him.” [[H5973]]

###### 19
So Saul [[H7586]] sent [[H7971]] messengers [[H4397]] to [[H413]] Jesse [[H3448]] and said, [[H559]] “Send [[H7971]] me your son [[H1121]] David, [[H1732]] who [[H834]] is with the sheep.” [[H6629]]

###### 20
And Jesse [[H3448]] took [[H3947]] a donkey [loaded with] [[H2543]] bread, [[H3899]] a skin [[H4997]] of wine, [[H3196]] and one [[H259]] young goat, [[H1423]] and sent them [[H7971]] to [[H413]] Saul [[H7586]] with [[H3027]] his son [[H1121]] David. [[H1732]]

###### 21
When David [[H1732]] came [[H935]] to [[H413]] Saul [[H7586]] and entered his service, [[H5975]] Saul admired [[H157]] him greatly, [[H3966]] and David became [[H1961]] his armor-bearer. [[H5375]]

###### 22
Then Saul [[H7586]] sent [[H7971]] word to [[H413]] Jesse, [[H3448]] saying, [[H559]] “Let David [[H1732]] remain in my service, [[H5975]] for [[H3588]] I am pleased with [[H4672]] him.” [[H5869]]

###### 23
And whenever [[H1961]] the spirit [[H7307]] from God [[H430]] came [[H1961]] upon [[H413]] Saul, [[H7586]] David [[H1732]] would pick up [[H3947]] his harp [[H3658]] and play, [[H5059]] and Saul [[H7586]] would become [[H7304]] well, [[H2895]] and the spirit [[H7307]] of distress [[H7451]] would depart [[H5493]] from him.
