### 1
One day [[H3117]] Jonathan [[H3129]] son [[H1121]] of Saul [[H7586]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] the young man [[H5288]] bearing [[H5375]] his armor, [[H3627]] “Come, [[H1980]] let us cross over [[H5674]] to [[H413]] the Philistine [[H6430]] outpost [[H4673]] on the other side.” [[H5676]] But [Jonathan] did not [[H3808]] tell [[H5046]] his father. [[H1]]

### 2
Meanwhile, Saul [[H7586]] was staying [[H3427]] under [[H8478]] the pomegranate tree [[H7416]] in Migron [[H4051]] on the outskirts [[H7097]] of Gibeah. [[H1390]] And the troops [[H5971]] who [were] [[H834]] with him [[H5973]] numbered about six [[H8337]] hundred [[H3967]] men, [[H376]]

### 3
including Ahijah, [[H281]] who was wearing [[H5375]] an ephod. [[H646]] He was the son [[H1121]] of Ichabod's [[H350]] brother [[H251]] Ahitub [[H285]] son [[H1121]] of Phinehas, [[H6372]] the son [[H1121]] of Eli [[H5941]] the priest [[H3548]] of the LORD [[H3068]] in Shiloh. [[H7887]] But the troops [[H5971]] did not [[H3808]] know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] Jonathan [[H3129]] had left. [[H1980]]

### 4
Now there were cliffs [[H8127]] on both sides [[H5676]] of the pass [[H4569]] that [[H834]] Jonathan [[H3129]] intended [[H1245]] to cross [[H5674]] to reach [[H5921]] the Philistine [[H6430]] outpost. [[H4673]] One [[H259]] was named [[H8034]] Bozez [[H949]] and the other [[H259]] Seneh. [[H5573]]

### 5
One [[H259]] cliff [[H8127]] stood [[H4690]] to the north [[H6828]] toward [[H4136]] Michmash, [[H4363]] and the other [[H259]] to the south [[H5045]] toward [[H4136]] Geba. [[H1387]]

### 6
Jonathan [[H3083]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] the young man [[H5288]] bearing [[H5375]] his armor, [[H3627]] “Come, [[H1980]] let us cross over [[H5674]] to [[H413]] the outpost [[H4673]] of these [[H428]] uncircumcised men. [[H6189]] Perhaps [[H194]] the LORD [[H3068]] will work [[H6213]] on our behalf. [[H3588]] Nothing [[H369]] can hinder [[H4622]] the LORD [[H3068]] from saving, [[H3467]] whether by many [[H7227]] or [[H176]] by few. [[H4592]]

### 7
His armor-bearer [[H5375]] replied, [[H559]] “Do [[H6213]] all [[H3605]] that is [[H834]] in your heart. [[H3824]] Go ahead; [[H5186]] I am [[H2005]] with you [[H5973]] heart and soul.” [[H3824]]

### 8
“Very well,” [[H2009]] said [[H559]] Jonathan, [[H3083]] “we will [[H587]] cross over [[H5674]] toward [[H413]] [these] men [[H582]] and show ourselves [[H1540]] to them. [[H413]]

### 9
If [[H518]] they say, [[H559]] ‘Wait [[H1826]] until [[H5704]] we come [[H5060]] to you,’ [[H413]] then we will stay [[H5975]] where [[H8478]] we are and not [[H3808]] go up [[H5927]] to them. [[H413]]

### 10
But if [[H518]] they say, [[H559]] ‘Come on up,’ [[H5927]] then we will go up, [[H5927]] because [[H3588]] this [[H2088]] will be our sign [[H226]] that the LORD [[H3068]] has delivered them [[H5414]] into our hands.” [[H3027]]

### 11
So the two of them [[H8147]] showed themselves [[H1540]] to [[H413]] the outpost [[H4673]] of the Philistines, [[H6430]] [who] [[H6430]] exclaimed, [[H559]] “Look, [[H2009]] the Hebrews [[H5680]] are coming out [[H3318]] of [[H4480]] the holes [[H2356]] in which [[H834]] they were hiding!” [[H2244]]

### 12
So the men [[H376]] of the outpost [[H4675]] called out [[H6030]] to Jonathan [[H3129]] and his armor-bearer, [[H5375]] “Come on up, [[H5927]] and we will teach [[H3045]] you a lesson!” [[H1697]] “Follow [[H5927]] me,” [[H310]] Jonathan [[H3129]] told [[H559]] his armor-bearer, [[H5375]] “for [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] has delivered them [[H5414]] into the hand [[H3027]] of Israel.” [[H3478]]

### 13
Then Jonathan [[H3129]] climbed up [[H5927]] on his hands [[H3027]] and feet, [[H7272]] with his armor-bearer [[H5375]] behind him. [[H310]] And [the Philistines] fell [[H5307]] before [[H6440]] Jonathan, [[H3129]] and his armor-bearer [[H5375]] followed [[H310]] and finished them off. [[H4191]]

### 14
In that first [[H7223]] assault, [[H4347]] Jonathan [[H3129]] and his armor-bearer [[H5375]] struck down [[H5221]] about twenty [[H6242]] men [[H376]] over half [[H2677]] an acre [[H4618]] of land. [[H7704]]

### 15
Terror [[H2731]] struck [the Philistines] [[H1961]] in the camp, [[H4264]] in the field, [[H7704]] and among all [[H3605]] the people. [[H5971]] Even those in the outposts [[H4673]] and raiding parties [[H7843]] trembled. [[H2729]] Indeed, [[H1571]] the earth [[H776]] quaked [[H7264]] and panic [[H2731]] spread [[H1961]] from God. [[H430]]

### 16
Now when Saul's [[H7586]] watchmen [[H6822]] at Gibeah [[H1390]] in Benjamin [[H1144]] looked [[H7200]] and saw [[H2009]] the troops [[H1995]] melting away [[H4127]] and scattering [[H1980]] in every direction, [[H1986]]

### 17
Saul [[H7586]] said [[H559]] to the troops [[H5971]] with him, [[H854]] “Call the roll [[H6485]] and see [[H7200]] who [[H4310]] has left [[H1980]] us.” [[H5973]] And when they had called the roll, [[H6485]] they saw [[H2009]] that Jonathan [[H3129]] and his armor-bearer [[H5375]] [were] not [there]. [[H369]]

### 18
Then Saul [[H7586]] said [[H559]] to Ahijah, [[H281]] “Bring [[H5066]] the ark [[H727]] of God.” [[H430]] (For [[H3588]] at that [[H1931]] time [[H3117]] it [[H727]] was [[H1961]] with the Israelites.) [[H1121]]

### 19
While [[H5704]] Saul [[H7586]] was talking [[H1696]] to [[H413]] the priest, [[H3548]] the commotion [[H1995]] in the Philistine [[H6430]] camp [[H4264]] continued to [[H1980]] increase. [[H7227]] So Saul [[H7586]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] the priest, [[H3548]] “Withdraw [[H622]] your hand.” [[H3027]]

### 20
Then Saul [[H7586]] and all [[H3605]] his troops [[H5971]] assembled [[H2199]] and marched [[H935]] to [[H5704]] the battle, [[H4421]] and they found [the Philistines] [[H2009]] in very [[H3966]] great [[H1419]] confusion, [[H4103]] with each man [[H376]] wielding [[H1961]] the sword [[H2719]] against his neighbor. [[H7453]]

### 21
And the Hebrews [[H5680]] who had [[H834]] previously [[H865]] gone up [[H5927]] into the surrounding camps [[H4264]] of the Philistines [[H6430]] now went over to [[H1961]] the Israelites [[H3478]] who [[H834]] were with [[H5973]] Saul [[H7586]] and Jonathan. [[H3129]]

### 22
When all [[H3605]] the Israelites [[H3478]] who had been hiding [[H2244]] in the hill country [[H2022]] of Ephraim [[H669]] heard [[H8085]] that [[H3588]] the Philistines [[H6430]] were fleeing, [[H5127]] they [[H1992]] also [[H1571]] joined [[H1692]] Saul and Jonathan in the battle. [[H4421]]

### 23
So the LORD [[H3068]] saved [[H3467]] Israel [[H3478]] that [[H1931]] day, [[H3117]] and the battle [[H4421]] moved on [[H5674]] beyond Beth-aven. [[H1007]]

### 24
Now the men [[H376]] of Israel [[H3478]] were in distress [[H5065]] that [[H1931]] day, [[H3117]] for Saul [[H7586]] had placed the troops [[H5971]] under an oath, [[H422]] saying, [[H559]] “Cursed [is] [[H779]] the man [[H376]] who [[H834]] eats [[H398]] [any] food [[H3899]] before [[H5704]] evening, [[H6153]] before I have taken vengeance [[H5358]] on my enemies.” [[H341]] So none [[H3808]] of the troops [[H5971]] tasted [[H2938]] any food. [[H3899]]

### 25
Then all [the troops] [[H3605]] entered [[H935]] the forest, [[H3293]] and there was [[H1961]] honey [[H1706]] on [[H5921]] the ground. [[H6440]]

### 26
And when [they] [[H5971]] entered [[H935]] the forest [[H3293]] and saw [[H2009]] the flowing [[H1982]] honey, [[H1706]] not one of them [[H369]] put [[H5381]] his hand [[H3027]] to [[H413]] his mouth, [[H6310]] because [[H3588]] [they] [[H5971]] feared [[H3372]] the oath. [[H7621]]

### 27
Jonathan, however, [[H3129]] had not [[H3808]] heard that [[H8085]] his father [[H1]] {had charged} the people [[H5971]] with the oath. [[H7650]] So he reached out [[H7971]] the end [[H7097]] of the staff [[H4294]] in his hand, [[H3027]] dipped [[H2881]] it into the honeycomb, [[H3295]] and put [[H7725]] his hand [[H3027]] to [[H413]] his mouth; [[H6310]] and his eyes [[H5869]] brightened. [[H7200]]

### 28
Then [[H6030]] one [[H376]] of the soldiers [[H5971]] told him, [[H559]] “Your father [[H1]] bound the troops [[H5971]] with a solemn oath, [[H7650]] saying, [[H7650]] ‘Cursed [is] [[H779]] the man [[H376]] who [[H834]] eats [[H398]] food [[H3899]] today.’ [[H3117]] That is why the people [[H5971]] are faint.” [[H5774]]

### 29
“My father [[H1]] has brought trouble [[H5916]] to the land,” [[H776]] Jonathan [[H3129]] replied. [[H559]] “Just look [[H7200]] at how [[H3588]] my eyes [[H5869]] have brightened [[H215]] because [[H3588]] I tasted [[H2938]] a little [[H4592]] of this [[H2088]] honey. [[H1706]]

### 30
How much better it would have been [[H637]] if [[H3863]] the troops [[H5971]] had eaten [[H398]] freely today [[H3117]] from the plunder [[H7998]] they took [[H4672]] from their enemies! [[H341]] Would not [[H6258]] the slaughter [[H4347]] of the Philistines [[H6430]] have been much greater?” [[H7235]]

### 31
That [[H1931]] day, [[H3117]] after the Israelites had struck down [[H5221]] the Philistines [[H6430]] from Michmash [[H4363]] to Aijalon, [[H357]] the people [[H5971]] were very [[H3966]] faint. [[H5774]]

### 32
So they rushed greedily [[H6213]] to [[H413]] the plunder, [[H7998]] taking [[H3947]] sheep, [[H6629]] cattle, [[H1241]] and calves. [[H1121]] They slaughtered them [[H7819]] on the ground [[H776]] and ate [[H398]] meat with [[H5921]] the blood still in it. [[H1818]]

### 33
Then someone reported [[H5046]] to Saul: [[H7586]] “Look, [[H2009]] the troops [[H5971]] are sinning [[H2398]] against the LORD [[H3068]] by eating [[H398]] meat with [[H5921]] the blood still in it.” [[H1818]] “You have broken faith,” [[H898]] said Saul. [[H559]] “Roll [[H1556]] a large [[H1419]] stone [[H68]] over here [[H413]] at once.” [[H3117]]

### 34
Then he [[H7586]] said, [[H559]] “Go [[H6327]] among the troops [[H5971]] and tell them, [[H559]] ‘Each man [[H376]] must bring [[H5066]] me [[H413]] his ox [[H7794]] or his sheep, [[H7716]] slaughter [them] [[H7819]] in this [place], [[H2088]] and then eat. [[H398]] Do not [[H3808]] sin [[H2398]] against the LORD [[H3068]] by eating [[H398]] meat with [[H413]] the blood still in it.’” [[H1818]] So that night [[H3915]] everyone [[H3605]] brought [[H5066]] his ox [[H7794]] and slaughtered [[H7819]] it there. [[H8033]]

### 35
Then Saul [[H7586]] built [[H1129]] an altar [[H4196]] to the LORD; [[H3068]] it was the first [[H2490]] time he had built [[H1129]] an altar [[H4196]] to the LORD. [[H3068]]

### 36
And Saul [[H7586]] said, [[H559]] “Let us go down [[H3381]] after [[H310]] the Philistines [[H6430]] by night [[H3915]] and plunder [[H962]] them until [[H5704]] dawn, [[H216]] leaving [[H7604]] no [[H3808]] man [alive]!” [[H376]] “Do [[H6213]] whatever [[H3605]] seems good [[H2896]] to you,” [[H5869]] the troops replied. [[H559]] But the priest [[H3548]] said, [[H559]] “We must consult [[H7126]] God [[H430]] here.” [[H1988]]

### 37
So Saul [[H7586]] inquired [[H7592]] of God, [[H430]] “Shall I go down [[H3381]] after [[H310]] the Philistines? [[H6430]] Will You give [[H5414]] them into the hand [[H3027]] of Israel?” [[H3478]] But God did not [[H3808]] answer [[H6030]] him that [[H1931]] day. [[H3117]]

### 38
Therefore Saul [[H7586]] said, [[H559]] “Come [[H5066]] here, [[H1988]] all [[H3605]] you leaders [[H6438]] of the troops, [[H5971]] and let us investigate [[H3045]] how [[H4100]] this [[H2063]] sin [[H2403]] has occurred [[H1961]] today. [[H3117]]

### 39
As surely as the LORD [[H3068]] lives [[H2416]] who delivers [[H3467]] Israel, [[H3478]] even [[H3588]] if [[H518]] it is [[H3426]] my son [[H1121]] Jonathan, [[H3129]] he must die!” [[H4191]] But not one [[H369]] of the troops [[H5971]] said [[H6030]] a word. [[H3605]]

### 40
Then Saul said [[H559]] to [[H413]] all [[H3605]] Israel, [[H3478]] “You [[H859]] stand [[H1961]] on one [[H259]] side, [[H5676]] and I [[H589]] and my son [[H1121]] Jonathan [[H3129]] will stand [[H1961]] on the other [[H259]] side.” [[H5676]] And the troops [[H5971]] replied, [[H559]] “Do [[H6213]] what seems good [[H2896]] to you.” [[H5869]]

### 41
So Saul [[H7586]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] the LORD, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] “[Why have You not answered Your servant this day? If the fault is with me or my son Jonathan, respond with Urim; but if the fault is with the men of Israel,] respond [[H3051]] with Thummim.” [[H8549]] And Jonathan [[H3129]] and Saul [[H7586]] were selected, [[H3920]] but the people [[H5971]] were cleared of the charge. [[H3318]]

### 42
Then Saul [[H7586]] said, [[H559]] “Cast [the lot] [[H5307]] between me [[H996]] and [[H996]] my son [[H1121]] Jonathan.” [[H3129]] And Jonathan [[H3129]] was selected. [[H3920]]

### 43
“Tell [[H5046]] me what [[H4100]] you have done,” [[H6213]] Saul [[H7586]] commanded [[H559]] him. [[H3129]] So Jonathan [[H3129]] told him, [[H5046]] “I only [[H2938]] tasted [[H2938]] a little [[H4592]] honey [[H1706]] with the end [[H7097]] of the staff [[H4294]] that [was] [[H834]] in my hand. [[H3027]] And now I must die?” [[H4191]]

### 44
And Saul [[H7586]] declared [[H559]] “May God [[H430]] punish me, [[H6213]] and ever so [[H3541]] severely, [[H3254]] if you, Jonathan, [[H3129]] do not [[H3588]] surely [[H4191]] die!” [[H4191]]

### 45
But the people [[H5971]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Saul, [[H7586]] “Must Jonathan [[H3129]] die— [[H4191]] he who [[H834]] accomplished [[H6213]] such [[H2063]] a great [[H1419]] deliverance [[H3444]] for Israel? [[H3478]] Never! [[H2486]] As surely as the LORD [[H3068]] lives, [[H2416]] not [[H518]] a hair [[H8185]] of his head [[H7218]] will fall [[H5307]] to the ground, [[H776]] for [[H3588]] with [[H5973]] Gods help [[H430]] he has accomplished this [[H6213]] today. [[H3117]] So the people [[H5971]] rescued [[H6299]] Jonathan, [[H3129]] and he did not [[H3808]] die. [[H4191]]

### 46
Then Saul [[H7586]] gave up [[H5927]] his pursuit [[H310]] of the Philistines, [[H6430]] and the Philistines [[H6430]] returned [[H1980]] to their own land. [[H4725]]

### 47
After Saul [[H7586]] had assumed [[H3920]] the kingship [[H4410]] over [[H5921]] Israel, [[H3478]] he fought [[H3898]] against all [[H3605]] his enemies [[H341]] on every side— [[H5439]] the Moabites, [[H4124]] the Ammonites, [[H1121]] the Edomites, [[H123]] the kings [[H4428]] of Zobah, [[H6678]] and the Philistines. [[H6430]] Wherever [[H3605]] he turned, [[H6437]] he routed them. [[H7561]]

### 48
He fought [[H6213]] valiantly [[H2428]] and defeated [[H5221]] the Amalekites, [[H6002]] delivering [[H5337]] Israel [[H3478]] from the hands [[H3027]] of its plunderers. [[H8154]]

### 49
Now the sons [[H1121]] of Saul [[H7586]] were [[H1961]] Jonathan, [[H3129]] Ishvi, [[H3440]] and Malchishua. [[H4444]] His two [[H8147]] daughters [[H1323]] were named [[H8034]] Merab [[H4764]] (his firstborn) [[H1067]] and Michal [[H4324]] (his younger daughter). [[H6996]]

### 50
His [[H7586]] wife's [[H802]] name [[H8034]] was Ahinoam [[H293]] daughter [[H1323]] of Ahimaaz. [[H290]] The name [[H8034]] of the commander [[H8269]] of his army [[H6635]] was Abner, [[H74]] son [[H1121]] of Saul’s [[H7586]] uncle [[H1730]] Ner. [[H5369]]

### 51
Saul’s [[H7586]] father [[H1]] Kish [[H7027]] and Abner’s [[H74]] father [[H1]] Ner [[H5369]] were sons [[H1121]] of Abiel. [[H22]]

### 52
And the war [[H4421]] with [[H5921]] the Philistines [[H6430]] was [[H1961]] fierce [[H2389]] for all [[H3605]] the days [[H3117]] of Saul. [[H7586]] So whenever [he] [[H7586]] noticed [[H7200]] any [[H3605]] strong [[H1368]] or brave [[H2428]] man, [[H1121]] he would enlist him. [[H622]]
