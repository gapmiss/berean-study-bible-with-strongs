###### 1
And the boy [[H5288]] Samuel [[H8050]] ministered [[H8334]] to [[H853]] the LORD [[H3068]] before [[H6440]] Eli. [[H5941]] Now in those [[H1992]] days [[H3117]] the word [[H1697]] of the LORD [[H3068]] was [[H1961]] rare [[H3368]] and visions [[H2377]] were [[H369]] scarce. [[H6555]]

###### 2
And [[H1961]] at that time [[H3117]] Eli, [[H5941]] whose eyesight [[H5869]] had grown so dim [[H3544]] that he could [[H3201]] not [[H3808]] see, [[H7200]] was lying [[H7901]] in his room. [[H4725]]

###### 3
Before [[H2962]] the lamp [[H5216]] of God [[H430]] had gone out, [[H3518]] Samuel [[H8050]] was lying down [[H7901]] in the temple [[H1964]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] where [[H834]] the ark [[H727]] of God [[H430]] was located. [[H8033]]

###### 4
Then the LORD [[H3068]] called [[H7121]] to Samuel, [[H8050]] and he answered, [[H559]] “Here I am.” [[H2005]]

###### 5
He ran [[H7323]] to [[H413]] Eli [[H5941]] and said, [[H559]] “Here I am, [[H2005]] for [[H3588]] you have called [[H7121]] me.”  “I did not [[H3808]] call,” [[H7121]] Eli replied. [[H559]] “Go back [[H7725]] and lie down.” [[H7901]] So he went [[H1980]] and lay down. [[H7901]]

###### 6
Once again [[H3254]] the LORD [[H3068]] called, [[H7121]] “Samuel!” [[H8050]] So Samuel [[H8050]] got up, [[H6965]] went [[H1980]] to [[H413]] Eli, [[H5941]] and said, [[H559]] “Here I am, [[H2005]] for [[H3588]] you have called [[H7121]] me.”  “My son, [[H1121]] I did not [[H3808]] call,” [[H7121]] Eli replied. [[H559]] “Go back [[H7725]] and lie down.” [[H7901]]

###### 7
Now Samuel [[H8050]] did not yet [[H2962]] know [[H3045]] the LORD, [[H3068]] because the word [[H1697]] of the LORD [[H3068]] had not yet [[H2962]] been revealed [[H1540]] to him. [[H413]]

###### 8
Once again, [[H3254]] for the third time, [[H7992]] the LORD [[H3068]] called [[H7121]] to Samuel. [[H8050]] He got up, [[H6965]] went [[H1980]] to [[H413]] Eli, [[H5941]] and said, [[H559]] “Here I am, [[H2005]] for [[H3588]] you have called [[H7121]] me.”  Then Eli [[H5941]] realized [[H995]] that it was the LORD [[H3068]] who was calling [[H7121]] the boy. [[H5288]]

###### 9
“Go [[H1980]] and lie down,” [[H7901]] he [[H5941]] said [[H559]] to Samuel, [[H8050]] “and [[H1961]] if [[H518]] He calls you, [[H7121]] say, [[H559]] ‘Speak, [[H1696]] LORD, [[H3068]] for [[H3588]] Your servant [[H5650]] is listening.’” [[H8085]] So Samuel [[H8050]] went [[H1980]] and lay down [[H7901]] in his place. [[H4725]]

###### 10
Then the LORD [[H3068]] came [[H935]] and stood there, [[H3320]] calling [[H7121]] as before, [[H6471]] “Samuel! [[H8050]] Samuel!” [[H8050]] And Samuel [[H8050]] answered, [[H559]] “Speak, [[H1696]] for [[H3588]] Your servant [[H5650]] is listening.” [[H8085]]

###### 11
Then the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Samuel, [[H8050]] “I [[H595]] am about to do [[H6213]] something [[H1697]] in Israel [[H3478]] at which [[H834]] the ears [[H241]] of all [[H3605]] who hear it [[H8085]] will tingle. [[H6750]]

###### 12
On that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] I will carry out [[H6965]] against [[H413]] Eli [[H5941]] everything [[H3605]] I have spoken [[H1696]] about [[H413]] his family, [[H1004]] from beginning [[H2490]] to end. [[H3615]]

###### 13
I told [[H5046]] him that [[H3588]] I [[H589]] will judge [[H8199]] his house [[H1004]] forever [[H5769]] for the iniquity [[H5771]] of which [[H834]] he knows, [[H3045]] because [[H3588]] his sons [[H1121]] blasphemed God [[H7043]] and he did not [[H3808]] restrain [[H3543]] them. 

###### 14
Therefore, [[H3651]] I have sworn [[H7650]] to the house [[H1004]] of Eli, [[H5941]] ‘The iniquity [[H5771]] of Eli’s [[H5941]] house [[H1004]] shall never [[H518]] be atoned for [[H3722]] by sacrifice [[H2077]] or offering.’” [[H4503]]

###### 15
Samuel [[H8050]] lay down [[H7901]] until [[H5704]] the morning; [[H1242]] then he opened [[H6605]] the doors [[H1817]] of the LORD’s [[H3068]] house. [[H1004]] He [[H8050]] was afraid [[H3372]] to tell [[H5046]] Eli [[H5941]] the vision, [[H4759]]

###### 16
but Eli [[H5941]] called [[H7121]] to him [[H8050]] and said, [[H559]] “Samuel, [[H8050]] my son.” [[H1121]] “Here I am,” [[H2005]] answered Samuel. [[H559]]

###### 17
“What [[H4100]] was the message [[H1697]] He gave you?” [[H1696]] Eli asked. [[H559]] “Do not [[H408]] hide [[H3582]] it from me. [[H4480]] May God [[H430]] punish [[H3541]] you,  and ever so [[H3541]] severely, [[H3254]] if [[H518]] you hide [[H3582]] from me [[H4480]] anything [[H1697]] He said [[H1696]] to you.” [[H413]]

###### 18
So Samuel [[H8050]] told [[H5046]] him  everything [[H3605]] and did not [[H3808]] hide [[H3582]] [a thing] from him. [[H4480]] “He [[H1931]] is the LORD,” [[H3068]] replied Eli. [[H559]] “Let Him do [[H6213]] what is good [[H2896]] in His eyes.” [[H5869]]

###### 19
And Samuel [[H8050]] grew, [[H1431]] and the LORD [[H3068]] was [[H1961]] with him, [[H5973]] and {He let} none [[H3808]] of [[H3605]] [Samuel's] words [[H1697]] fall [[H5307]] to the ground. [[H776]]

###### 20
So all [[H3605]] Israel [[H3478]] from Dan [[H1835]] to [[H5704]] Beersheba [[H884]] knew [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] Samuel [[H8050]] was confirmed [[H539]] as a prophet [[H5030]] of the LORD. [[H3068]]

###### 21
And the LORD [[H3068]] continued [[H3254]] to appear [[H7200]] at Shiloh, [[H7887]] because [[H3588]] there [[H7887]] He [[H3068]] revealed Himself [[H1540]] to [[H413]] Samuel [[H8050]] by His [[H3068]] word. [[H1697]]
