### 1
Soon Nahash [[H5176]] the Ammonite [[H5984]] came up [[H5927]] and laid siege [[H2583]] to [[H5921]] Jabesh-gilead. [[H3003]] All [[H3605]] the men [[H376]] of Jabesh [[H3003]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] him, [[H5176]] “Make [[H3772]] a treaty with us, [[H1285]] and we will serve you.” [[H5647]]

### 2
But Nahash [[H5176]] the Ammonite [[H5984]] replied, [[H559]] “I will make [a treaty] [[H3772]] with you  on one [condition], [[H2063]] that I may put out [[H5365]] everyone’s [[H3605]] right [[H3225]] eye [[H5869]] and bring [[H7760]] reproach [[H2781]] upon [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] Israel.” [[H3478]]

### 3
“Hold off [[H7503]] for  seven [[H7651]] days,” [[H3117]] replied [[H559]] the elders [[H2205]] of Jabesh, [[H3003]] “and let us send [[H7971]] messengers [[H4397]] throughout [[H3605]] Israel. [[H3478]] If [[H518]] [there is] no one [[H369]] to deliver [[H3467]] us, [[H853]] we will surrender [[H3318]] to you.” [[H413]]

### 4
When the messengers [[H4397]] came [[H935]] to Gibeah [[H1390]] of Saul [[H7586]] and reported [[H1696]] these terms [[H1697]] in the hearing [[H241]] of the people, [[H5971]] they all [[H3605]] wept [[H1058]] aloud. [[H5375]]

### 5
Just then [[H2009]] Saul [[H7586]] was returning [[H935]] from [[H4480]] the field, [[H7704]] behind [[H310]] his oxen. [[H1241]] “What [troubles] [[H4100]] the people?” [[H5971]] asked [[H559]] Saul. [[H7586]] “Why [[H3588]] are they weeping?” [[H1058]] And they relayed [[H5608]] to him  the words of [[H1697]] the men [[H582]] from Jabesh. [[H3003]]

### 6
When Saul heard [[H8085]] their [[H428]] words, [[H1697]] the Spirit [[H7307]] of God [[H430]] rushed [[H6743]] upon [[H5921]] him, [[H7586]] and he burned with great anger. [[H639]]

### 7
He took [[H3947]] a pair [[H6776]] of oxen, [[H1241]] cut them into pieces, [[H5408]] and sent [them] [[H7971]] by [[H3027]] messengers [[H4397]] throughout [[H3605]] the land [[H1366]] of Israel, [[H3478]] proclaiming, [[H559]] “This is what [[H3541]] will be done [[H6213]] to the oxen [[H1241]] of anyone who [[H834]] does not [[H369]] march [[H3318]] behind [[H310]] Saul [[H7586]] and Samuel. [[H8050]] Then the terror [[H6343]] of the LORD [[H3068]] fell [[H5307]] upon [[H5921]] the people, [[H5971]] and they turned out [[H3318]] as one [[H259]] man. [[H376]]

### 8
And when [Saul] numbered them [[H6485]] at Bezek, [[H966]] there were [[H1961]] 300,000 [[H7969]] Israelites [[H1121]] and 30,000 [[H7970]] men [[H376]] of Judah. [[H3063]]

### 9
So they said [[H559]] to the messengers [[H4397]] who had come, [[H935]] “Tell [[H559]] the men [[H376]] of Jabesh-gilead: [[H3003]] ‘Deliverance [[H8668]] will be [[H1961]] yours  tomorrow [[H4279]] by the time the sun [[H8121]] is hot.’” [[H2527]] And when the messengers [[H4397]] relayed [this] [[H5046]] to the men [[H376]] of Jabesh, [[H3003]] they rejoiced. [[H8055]]

### 10
Then the men [[H582]] of Jabesh [[H3003]] said [to Nahash], [[H559]] “Tomorrow [[H4279]] we will come out, [[H3318]] and you can do [[H6213]] with us  whatever [[H3605]] seems good [[H2896]] to you.” [[H5869]]

### 11
The next day [[H4283]] Saul [[H7586]] organized [[H7760]] the troops [[H5971]] into three [[H7969]] divisions, [[H7218]] and during the morning [[H1242]] watch [[H821]] they invaded [[H935]] the camp [[H4264]] of the Ammonites [[H5983]] and slaughtered [[H5221]] them until [[H5704]] the hottest part [[H2527]] of the day. [[H3117]] And [[H1961]] the survivors [[H7604]] were so scattered [[H6327]] that no [[H3808]] two [[H8147]] of them  were left [[H7604]] together. [[H3162]]

### 12
Then the people [[H5971]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Samuel, [[H8050]] “Who [[H4310]] said [[H559]] that Saul [[H7586]] should not reign [[H4427]] over us? [[H5921]] Bring [[H5414]] those men here, [[H376]] so that we can kill them!” [[H4191]]

### 13
But Saul [[H7586]] ordered, [[H559]] “No [[H3808]] one [[H376]] shall be put to death [[H4191]] this [[H2088]] day, [[H3117]] for [[H3588]] today [[H3117]] the LORD [[H3068]] has worked [[H6213]] salvation [[H8668]] in Israel.” [[H3478]]

### 14
Then Samuel [[H8050]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] the people, [[H5971]] “Come, [[H1980]] let us go [[H1980]] to Gilgal [[H1537]] and renew [[H2318]] the kingship [[H4410]] there.” [[H8033]]

### 15
So all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] went [[H1980]] to Gilgal [[H1537]] [and] [[H8033]] confirmed Saul [[H7586]] as king [[H4427]] in the presence of [[H6440]] the LORD. [[H3068]] There [[H8033]] they sacrificed [[H2076]] peace offerings [[H8002]] before [[H6440]] the LORD, [[H3068]] and Saul [[H7586]] and all [[H3605]] the Israelites [[H3478]] rejoiced [[H8055]] greatly.
