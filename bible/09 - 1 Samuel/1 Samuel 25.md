###### 1
When Samuel [[H8050]] died, [[H4191]] all [[H3605]] Israel [[H3478]] gathered [[H6908]] to mourn [[H5594]] for him;  and they buried him [[H6912]] at his home [[H1004]] in Ramah. [[H7414]] Then David [[H1732]] set out [[H6965]] and went down [[H3381]] to [[H413]] the Wilderness [[H4057]] of Paran. [[H6290]]

###### 2
Now [there was] a man [[H376]] in Maon [[H4584]] whose business [[H4639]] was in Carmel; [[H3760]] he was a very [[H3966]] wealthy [[H1419]] man [[H376]] with a thousand [[H505]] goats [[H5795]] and three [[H7969]] thousand [[H505]] sheep, [[H6629]] which he was [[H1961]] shearing [[H1494]] in Carmel. [[H3760]]

###### 3
His [[H376]] name [[H8034]] was Nabal, [[H5037]] and his wife’s [[H802]] name [was] [[H8034]] Abigail. [[H26]] She was an intelligent [[H2896]] and beautiful [[H3303]] woman, [[H802]] but her husband, [[H376]] a Calebite, [[H3820]] was harsh [[H7186]] and evil [[H7451]] in his dealings. [[H4611]]

###### 4
While David [[H1732]] was in the wilderness, [[H4057]] he heard [[H8085]] that [[H3588]] Nabal [[H5037]] was shearing [[H1494]] sheep. [[H6629]]

###### 5
So David [[H1732]] sent [[H7971]] ten [[H6235]] young men [[H5288]] and instructed them, [[H559]] “Go up [[H5927]] to [[H413]] Nabal [[H5037]] at Carmel. [[H3760]] Greet [[H7592]] him  in my name [[H8034]]

###### 6
and say to him, [[H559]] ‘Long life to you, [[H2416]] and peace [[H7965]] to you [[H859]] and your house [[H1004]] and to all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] belongs to you. 

###### 7
Now [[H6258]] I hear [[H8085]] that [[H3588]] it is time for shearing. [[H1494]] When your shepherds [[H7462]] were [[H1961]] with us, [[H5973]] we did not [[H3808]] harass them, [[H3637]] and nothing [[H3808]] of theirs was missing [[H6485]] the whole [[H3605]] time [[H3117]] they were [[H1961]] in Carmel. [[H3760]]

###### 8
Ask [[H7592]] your young men, [[H5288]] and they will tell you. [[H5046]] So let my young men [[H5288]] find [[H4672]] favor with you, [[H2580]] for [[H3588]] we have come [[H935]] on [[H5921]] the day [[H3117]] of a feast. [[H2896]] Please [[H4994]] give [[H5414]] whatever [[H834]] you can afford [[H4672]] to your servants [[H5650]] and to your son [[H1121]] David.’” [[H1732]]

###### 9
When David's [[H1732]] young men [[H5288]] arrived, [[H935]] they relayed [[H1696]] all [[H3605]] these [[H428]] words [[H1697]] to [[H413]] Nabal [[H5037]] on behalf of David. [[H1732]] Then they waited. [[H5117]]

###### 10
But Nabal [[H5037]] asked [[H559]] them, [[H5650]] “Who [[H4310]] is David? [[H1732]] Who [is] [[H4310]] this son of [[H1121]] Jesse? [[H3448]] Many [[H7235]] servants [[H5650]] these days [[H3117]] are breaking away [[H6555]] from [[H6440]] their masters. [[H113]]

###### 11
Why should I take [[H3947]] my bread [[H3899]] and [[H853]] water [[H4325]] and the meat [[H2878]] I have slaughtered [[H2873]] for my shearers, [[H1494]] and give [[H5414]] them to these men [[H376]] whose origin [[H335]] I do not [[H3808]] know?” [[H3045]]

###### 12
So David's [[H1732]] men [[H5288]] turned around [[H2015]] and went back, [[H7725]] and they relayed [[H5046]] to him  all [[H3605]] these [[H428]] words. [[H1697]]

###### 13
And David [[H1732]] said [[H559]] to his men, [[H376]] “Each of you, [[H376]] put on [[H2296]] your swords!” [[H2719]] So David [[H1732]] and [[H1571]] all his men [[H376]] put on [[H2296]] their swords, [[H2719]] and about four [[H702]] hundred [[H3967]] men [[H376]] followed [[H5927]] David, [[H1732]] while two hundred [[H3967]] stayed [[H3427]] with [[H5921]] the supplies. [[H3627]]

###### 14
Meanwhile, one [[H259]] of Nabal’s [[H5288]] young men [[H5288]] informed [[H5046]] Nabal’s [[H5037]] wife [[H802]] Abigail, [[H26]] “Look, [[H2009]] David [[H1732]] sent [[H7971]] messengers [[H4397]] from the wilderness [[H4057]] to greet [[H1288]] our master, [[H113]] but he scolded them. [[H5860]]

###### 15
Yet these men [[H582]] were very [[H3966]] good [[H2896]] to us.  When we were [[H1961]] in the field, [[H7704]] we were not [[H3808]] harassed, [[H3637]] and nothing [[H3808]] of ours went missing [[H6485]] the whole [[H3605]] time [[H3117]] we lived [[H1980]] among them. [[H854]]

###### 16
They were [[H1961]] a wall [[H2346]] around us, [[H5921]] both [[H1571]] day [[H3119]] and [[H1571]] night, [[H3915]] the whole [[H3605]] time [[H3117]] we were [[H1961]] herding [[H7462]] our sheep [[H6629]] near them. [[H5973]]

###### 17
Now [[H6258]] consider carefully [[H3045]] what [[H4100]] you must do, [[H6213]] because [[H3588]] disaster [[H7451]] looms [[H3615]] over [[H413]] our master [[H113]] and [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] his household. [[H1004]] For he [is such] [[H1931]] a scoundrel [[H1100]] that nobody can speak [[H1696]] to him!” [[H413]]

###### 18
Abigail [[H26]] hurried [[H4116]] and took [[H3947]] two hundred [[H3967]] [loaves] of bread, [[H3899]] two [[H8147]] skins [[H5035]] of wine, [[H3196]] five [[H2568]] butchered [[H6213]] sheep, [[H6629]] five [[H2568]] seahs [[H5429]] of roasted grain, [[H7039]] a hundred [[H3967]] clusters of raisins, [[H6778]] and two hundred [[H3967]] cakes of figs. [[H1690]] She loaded [[H7760]] them on [[H5921]] donkeys [[H2543]]

###### 19
and said [[H559]] to her young men, [[H5288]] “Go [[H5674]] ahead of me. [[H6440]] I will be [[H2005]] right behind you.” [[H310]] But she did not [[H3808]] tell [[H5046]] her husband [[H376]] Nabal. [[H5037]]

###### 20
As [Abigail] [[H1931]] came riding [[H7392]] her donkey [[H2543]] into a mountain [[H2022]] ravine, [[H5643]] she saw [[H2009]] David [[H1732]] and his men [[H376]] coming down [[H3381]] toward her, [[H7122]] and she met [[H6298]] them. [[H853]]

###### 21
Now David [[H1732]] had just [[H389]] finished saying, [[H559]] “In vain [[H8267]] I have protected [[H8104]] all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] belonged to this man [[H2088]] in the wilderness [[H4057]] so that nothing [[H3808]] was missed [[H6485]] of all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] [belongs] to him,  yet he has paid me back [[H7725]] evil [[H7451]] for [[H8478]] good. [[H2896]]

###### 22
May God [[H430]] punish [[H3541]] David, [[H1732]] and ever so [[H3541]] severely, [[H3254]] if {I let} [[H518]] one [[H3605]] of his men [[H8366]] survive [[H7604]] until [[H5704]] morning.” [[H1242]]

###### 23
When Abigail [[H26]] saw [[H7200]] David, [[H1732]] she quickly [[H4116]] got off [[H3381]] the donkey, [[H2543]] fell [[H5307]] facedown, [[H6440]] and bowed [[H7812]] before [[H639]] him. [[H1732]]

###### 24
She fell [[H5307]] at [[H5921]] his feet [[H7272]] and said, [[H559]] “My lord, [[H113]] may the blame be [[H5771]] on me alone,  but please [[H4994]] let your servant [[H519]] speak [[H1696]] to you; [[H241]] hear [[H8085]] the words [[H1697]] of your servant. [[H519]]

###### 25
My lord [[H113]] should pay no [[H408]] attention [[H7760]] to [[H413]] this [[H2088]] worthless [[H1100]] man [[H376]] Nabal, [[H5037]] for [[H3588]] he [[H1931]] lives up to his name: [[H8034]] His name [[H8034]] means Fool, [[H5037]] and folly [[H5039]] accompanies him. [[H5973]] I, [[H589]] your servant, [[H519]] did not [[H3808]] see [[H7200]] my lord’s [[H113]] young men [[H5288]] whom [[H834]] you sent. [[H7971]]

###### 26
Now, [[H6258]] my lord, [[H113]] as surely as the LORD [[H3068]] lives [[H2416]] and you [[H5315]] yourself live, [[H2416]] the LORD [[H3068]] has held you back [[H4513]] from coming [[H935]] to bloodshed [[H1818]] and avenging [[H3467]] yourself  with your own hand. [[H3027]] May your enemies [[H341]] and those who seek [[H1245]] harm [[H7451]] for [[H413]] my lord [[H113]] be [[H1961]] like Nabal. [[H5037]]

###### 27
Now [[H6258]] {let} this [[H2063]] gift [[H1293]] your servant [[H8198]] has brought [[H935]] to my lord [[H113]] be given [[H5414]] to the young men [[H5288]] who follow [[H1980]] [you]. [[H113]]

###### 28
Please [[H4994]] forgive [[H5375]] your servant’s [[H519]] offense, [[H6588]] for [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] will surely [[H6213]] make [[H6213]] a lasting [[H539]] dynasty [[H1004]] for my lord, [[H113]] because [[H3588]] he [[H113]] fights [[H3898]] the LORD’s [[H3068]] battles. [[H4421]] May no evil [[H7451]] be found [[H4672]] in you  as long as you live. [[H3117]]

###### 29
And should someone [[H120]] pursue you [[H7291]] and seek [[H1245]] your life, [[H5315]] then the life [[H5315]] of my lord [[H113]] will be [[H1961]] bound securely [[H6887]] in the bundle [[H6872]] of the living [[H2416]] with [[H854]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God. [[H430]] But [[H853]] He shall fling away [[H7049]] the lives [[H5315]] of your enemies [[H341]] [like stones] [[H3709]] from a sling. [[H7050]]

###### 30
When [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] has done [[H6213]] for my lord [[H113]] all [[H3605]] the good [[H2896]] He promised [[H1696]] and has appointed you [[H6680]] ruler [[H5057]] over [[H5921]] Israel, [[H3478]]

###### 31
then my lord [[H113]] will have [[H1961]] no [[H3808]] remorse [[H6330]] or guilt [[H4383]] of conscience [[H3820]] over needless [[H2600]] bloodshed [[H8210]] [and] [[H113]] revenge. [[H3467]] And when the LORD [[H3068]] has dealt well [[H3190]] with my lord, [[H113]] may you remember [[H2142]] your maidservant.” [[H519]]

###### 32
Then David [[H1732]] said [[H559]] to Abigail, [[H26]] “Blessed [be] [[H1288]] the LORD, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] who [[H834]] sent you [[H7971]] to meet me [[H7122]] this [[H2088]] day! [[H3117]]

###### 33
Blessed [is] [[H1288]] your discernment, [[H2940]] and blessed [are] [[H1288]] you, [[H859]] because [[H834]] today [[H3117]] you kept me [[H3607]] from bloodshed [[H1818]] and from avenging [[H3467]] myself by my own hand. [[H3027]]

###### 34
Otherwise, [[H199]] as surely as the LORD, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] lives, [[H2416]] who [[H834]] has restrained me [[H4513]] from harming [[H7489]] you, [[H853]] if you had not [[H3588]] come [[H935]] quickly [[H4116]] to meet me, [[H7122]] then surely [[H3588]] no [[H518]] male [[H8366]] belonging to Nabal [[H5037]] would have been left alive [[H3498]] by [[H5704]] morning [[H1242]] light. [[H216]]

###### 35
Then David [[H1732]] accepted [[H3947]] from her hand [[H3027]] what [[H834]] she had brought [[H935]] him,  and he said [[H559]] to her,  “Go [[H5927]] home [[H1004]] in peace. [[H7965]] See, [[H7200]] I have heeded [[H8085]] your voice [[H6963]] and granted your request.” [[H5375]]

###### 36
When Abigail [[H26]] returned [[H935]] to [[H413]] Nabal, [[H5037]] there [[H2009]] he was  in the house, [[H1004]] holding a feast [[H4960]] fit for a king, [[H4428]] in high [[H2896]] spirits [[H3820]] and very [[H5704]] drunk. [[H7910]] So she [[H3808]] told [[H5046]] him  nothing [[H6996]] until [[H5704]] morning [[H1242]] light. [[H216]]

###### 37
In the morning [[H1242]] when Nabal [[H5037]] was sober, [[H3318]] his wife [[H802]] told [[H5046]] him about these [[H428]] events, [[H1697]] and his heart [[H3820]] failed [[H4191]] within him [[H7130]] and he [[H1931]] became [[H1961]] [like] a stone. [[H68]]

###### 38
About ten [[H6235]] days later, [[H3117]] the LORD [[H3068]] struck [[H5062]] Nabal [[H5037]] dead. [[H4191]]

###### 39
On hearing [[H8085]] that [[H3588]] Nabal [[H5037]] was dead, [[H4191]] David [[H1732]] said, [[H559]] “Blessed [be] [[H1288]] the LORD [[H3068]] who [[H834]] has upheld [[H7378]] my cause [[H7379]] against [[H3027]] the reproach [[H2781]] of Nabal [[H5037]] and [[H853]] has restrained [[H2820]] His servant [[H5650]] from evil. [[H7451]] For [[H853]] the LORD [[H3068]] has brought [[H7725]] the wickedness [[H7451]] of Nabal [[H5037]] down upon his own head. [[H7218]] Then David [[H1732]] sent [[H7971]] word [[H1696]] to Abigail, [[H26]] asking [[H3947]] for her  in marriage. [[H802]]

###### 40
When [his] [[H1732]] servants [[H5650]] came [[H935]] to [[H413]] Abigail [[H26]] at Carmel, [[H3760]] they said, [[H1696]] “David [[H1732]] has sent us [[H7971]] to take you [[H3947]] as his wife.” [[H802]]

###### 41
She arose, [[H6965]] then bowed [[H7812]] facedown [[H639]] and said, [[H559]] “Here is [[H2009]] your maidservant, [[H519]] ready to serve [[H8198]] and to wash [[H7364]] the feet [[H7272]] of my lord’s [[H113]] servants.” [[H5650]]

###### 42
So Abigail [[H26]] hurried [[H4116]] and got on [[H7392]] a donkey, [[H2543]] and attended [[H1980]] [by] five [[H2568]] of her maidens, [[H5291]] she followed [[H1980]] David’s [[H1732]] messengers [[H4397]] and became [[H1961]] his wife. [[H802]]

###### 43
David [[H1732]] had also [[H853]] married [[H3947]] Ahinoam [[H293]] of Jezreel. [[H3157]] So [she and Abigail] were both [[H8147]] his  wives. [[H802]]

###### 44
But Saul [[H7586]] had given [[H5414]] his daughter [[H1323]] Michal, [[H4324]] David’s [[H1732]] wife, [[H802]] to Palti [[H6406]] son [[H1121]] of Laish, [[H3919]] who [was] [[H834]] from Gallim. [[H1554]]
