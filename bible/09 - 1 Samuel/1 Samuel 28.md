###### 1
Now [[H1961]] in those [[H1992]] days [[H3117]] the Philistines [[H6430]] gathered [[H6908]] their forces [[H4264]] for war, [[H6635]] to fight [[H3898]] against Israel. [[H3478]] So Achish [[H397]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] David, [[H1732]] “You must understand [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] you [[H859]] and your men [[H376]] will accompany me [[H3318]] in the army.” [[H4264]]

###### 2
David [[H1732]] replied, [[H559]] “Then [[H3651]] you [[H859]] will come to know [[H3045]] what [[H834]] your servant [[H5650]] can do.” [[H6213]] “Very well,” [[H3651]] said [[H559]] Achish. [[H397]] “I will make you [[H7760]] my bodyguard [[H8104]] for life.” [[H3117]]

###### 3
Now by this time Samuel [[H8050]] had died, [[H4191]] and all [[H3605]] Israel [[H3478]] had mourned [[H5594]] for him  and buried [[H6912]] him in Ramah, [[H7414]] his own city. [[H5892]] And Saul [[H7586]] had removed [[H5493]] the mediums [[H178]] and spiritists [[H3049]] from the land. [[H776]]

###### 4
The Philistines [[H6430]] came together [[H6908]] and camped [[H2583]] at Shunem, [[H7766]] while Saul [[H7586]] gathered [[H6908]] all [[H3605]] Israel [[H3478]] and camped [[H2583]] at Gilboa. [[H1533]]

###### 5
When Saul [[H7586]] saw [[H7200]] the Philistine [[H6430]] army, [[H4264]] he [[H3820]] was afraid [[H3372]] and trembled [[H2729]] violently. [[H3966]]

###### 6
He inquired [[H7592]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] but the LORD [[H3068]] did not [[H3808]] answer him [[H6030]] by dreams [[H2472]] or [[H1571]] Urim [[H224]] or [[H1571]] prophets. [[H5030]]

###### 7
Then Saul [[H7586]] said [[H559]] to his servants, [[H5650]] “Find [[H1245]] me a woman [[H802]] who is a medium, [[H178]] so I can go [[H1980]] and consult [[H1875]] her.”  “There [is] [[H2009]] a medium [[H178]] at Endor,” [[H5874]] his servants [[H5650]] replied. [[H559]]

###### 8
So Saul [[H7586]] disguised himself [[H2664]] by putting on [[H3847]] different [[H312]] clothes, [[H899]] and he set out [[H1980]] with [[H5973]] two [[H8147]] of his men. [[H582]] They came [[H935]] to [[H413]] the woman [[H802]] at night, [[H3915]] and Saul said, [[H559]] “Consult [[H7080]] a spirit for me. [[H178]] Bring up [[H5927]] for me  the one [[H834]] I name. [[H559]]

###### 9
But the woman [[H802]] replied, [[H559]] “Surely [[H2009]] you [[H859]] know [[H3045]] what [[H834]] Saul [[H7586]] has done, [[H6213]] how [[H834]] he has killed [[H3772]] the mediums [[H178]] and spiritists [[H3049]] in [[H4480]] the land. [[H776]] Why [[H4100]] have you [[H859]] set a trap [[H5367]] to get me killed?” [[H4191]]

###### 10
Then Saul [[H7586]] swore [[H7650]] to her by the LORD: [[H3068]] “As surely as the LORD [[H3068]] lives, [[H2416]] no [[H518]] punishment [[H5771]] shall come upon you [[H7136]] for [[H1697]] this.” [[H2088]]

###### 11
“Whom [[H4310]] shall I bring up [[H5927]] for you?”  the woman [[H802]] asked. [[H559]] “Bring up [[H5927]] Samuel,” [[H8050]] he replied. [[H559]]

###### 12
But when the woman [[H802]] saw [[H7200]] Samuel, [[H8050]] she cried out [[H2199]] in a loud [[H1419]] voice [[H6963]] [and] [[H802]] said [[H559]] to Saul, [[H7586]] “Why [[H4100]] have you deceived me? [[H7411]] You [[H859]] are Saul!” [[H7586]]

###### 13
“Do not [[H408]] be afraid,” [[H3372]] the king [[H4428]] replied. [[H559]] “What [[H4100]] do you see?” [[H7200]] “I see [[H7200]] a god [[H430]] coming up [[H5927]] out of [[H4480]] the earth,” [[H776]] the woman [[H802]] answered. [[H559]]

###### 14
“What [[H4100]] does he look like?” [[H8389]] asked Saul. [[H559]] “An old [[H2205]] man [[H376]] is coming up,” [[H5927]] she replied. [[H559]] “And he is [[H1931]] wearing [[H5844]] a robe.” [[H4598]] So Saul [[H7586]] knew [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] it [[H1931]] was Samuel, [[H8050]] and he bowed [[H6915]] facedown [[H639]] in reverence. [[H7812]]

###### 15
Then Samuel [[H8050]] said [[H559]] to Saul, [[H7586]] “Why [[H4100]] have you disturbed [[H7264]] me by bringing me up?” [[H5927]] “I am deeply [[H3966]] distressed,” [[H6887]] replied [[H559]] Saul. [[H7586]] “The Philistines [[H6430]] are fighting [[H3898]] against me,  and God [[H430]] has turned away [[H5493]] from me. [[H5921]] He no [[H3808]] longer [[H5750]] answers me, [[H6030]] either [[H1571]] by [[H3027]] the prophets [[H5030]] or [[H1571]] dreams. [[H2472]] So I have called [[H7121]] on you  to tell [[H3045]] me what [[H4100]] to do.” [[H6213]]

###### 16
“Why [[H4100]] do you consult me,” [[H7592]] asked [[H559]] Samuel, [[H8050]] “since the LORD [[H3068]] has turned away [[H5493]] from you [[H5921]] and become [[H1961]] your enemy? [[H6145]]

###### 17
[He] [[H3068]] has done [[H6213]] exactly what [[H834]] He spoke [[H1696]] through me: [[H3027]] The LORD [[H3068]] has torn [[H7167]] the kingship [[H4467]] out of your hand [[H3027]] and given it [[H5414]] to your neighbor [[H7453]] David. [[H1732]]

###### 18
Because [[H834]] you did not [[H3808]] obey [[H8085]] the LORD [[H3068]] [or] [[H3808]] carry out [[H6213]] His burning [[H2740]] anger [[H639]] against Amalek, [[H6002]] the LORD [[H3068]] has done [[H6213]] this to you today. [[H2088]]

###### 19
Moreover, [[H1571]] the LORD [[H3068]] will deliver [[H5414]] Israel [[H3478]] with you [[H5973]] into the hands [[H3027]] of the Philistines, [[H6430]] and tomorrow [[H4279]] you [[H859]] and your sons [[H1121]] will be with me. [[H5973]] And [[H1571]] the LORD [[H3068]] will deliver [[H5414]] the army [[H4264]] of Israel [[H3478]] into the hands [[H3027]] of the Philistines.” [[H6430]]

###### 20
Immediately [[H4116]] Saul [[H7586]] fell [[H5307]] flat [[H4393]] on the ground, [[H776]] terrified [[H3372]] by the words [[H1697]] of Samuel. [[H8050]] And [[H1571]] his strength [[H3581]] was [[H1961]] gone, [[H3808]] because [[H3588]] he had not [[H3808]] eaten [[H398]] anything [[H3899]] all that [[H3605]] day [[H3117]] and [[H3605]] night. [[H3915]]

###### 21
When the woman [[H802]] came [[H935]] to [[H413]] Saul [[H7586]] and saw [[H7200]] how [[H3588]] distraught he was, [[H926]] she said [[H559]] to him, [[H413]] “Look, [[H2009]] your maidservant [[H8198]] has obeyed [[H8085]] your voice. [[H6963]] I took [[H7760]] my life [[H5315]] in my hands [[H3709]] and did [[H8085]] as [[H834]] you told [[H1696]] me. [[H413]]

###### 22
Now [[H6258]] please [[H4994]] listen [[H8085]] to your servant [[H8198]] and let me set [[H7760]] a morsel [[H6595]] of bread [[H3899]] before you. [[H6440]] Eat, [[H398]] and it will give [[H1961]] you  strength [[H3581]] to [[H3588]] go [[H1980]] on your way.” [[H1870]]

###### 23
Saul refused, [[H3985]] saying, [[H559]] “I will not [[H3808]] eat.” [[H398]] But his servants [[H5650]] joined [[H1571]] the woman [[H802]] in urging [[H6555]] him,  and he heeded [[H8085]] their voice. [[H6963]] He got up [[H6965]] from the ground [[H776]] and sat [[H3427]] on [[H413]] the bed. [[H4296]]

###### 24
The woman [[H802]] had a fattened [[H4770]] calf [[H5695]] at her house, [[H1004]] and she quickly [[H4116]] slaughtered it. [[H2076]] She also took [[H3947]] flour, [[H7058]] kneaded it, [[H3888]] and baked [[H644]] unleavened bread. [[H4682]]

###### 25
She served [[H5066]] it to [[H6440]] Saul [[H7586]] and his servants, [[H5650]] and they ate. [[H398]] And that [[H1931]] night [[H3915]] they got up [[H6965]] and left. [[H1980]]
