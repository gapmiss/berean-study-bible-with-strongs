### 1
Then Samuel [[H8050]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] all [[H3605]] Israel, [[H3478]] “I have listened [[H8085]] to your voice [[H6963]] in all [[H3605]] that you have said [[H559]] to me,  and I have set [[H4427]] over you [[H5921]] a king. [[H4428]]

### 2
Now [[H6258]] here is [[H2009]] the king [[H4428]] walking [[H1980]] before you, [[H6440]] and I [[H589]] am old [[H2204]] and gray, [[H7867]] and my sons [[H1121]] are here [[H2009]] with you. [[H854]] I [[H589]] have walked [[H1980]] before you [[H6440]] from my youth [[H5271]] until [[H5704]] this [[H2088]] day. [[H3117]]

### 3
Here I am. [[H2005]] Bear witness [[H6030]] against me  before [[H5048]] the LORD [[H3068]] and before [[H5048]] His anointed: [[H4899]] Whose [[H4310]] ox [[H7794]] or donkey [[H2543]] have I taken? [[H3947]] Whom [[H4310]] have I wronged [[H6231]] or oppressed? [[H7533]] From whose [[H4310]] hand [[H3027]] have I accepted [[H3947]] a bribe [[H3724]] and closed [[H5956]] my eyes? [[H5869]] Tell me,  and I will restore [it] [[H7725]] to you. 

### 4
“You have not [[H3808]] wronged us [[H6231]] or [[H3808]] oppressed us,” [[H7533]] they replied, [[H559]] “nor [[H3808]] have you taken [[H3947]] anything [[H3972]] from the hand [[H3027]] of man.” [[H376]]

### 5
Samuel said [[H559]] to them, [[H413]] “The LORD [[H3068]] is a witness [[H5707]] against you,  and His anointed [[H4899]] is a witness [[H5707]] today, [[H3117]] that [[H3588]] you have not [[H3808]] found [[H4672]] anything [[H3972]] in my hand.” [[H3027]] “He is a witness,” [[H5707]] they said. [[H559]]

### 6
Then Samuel [[H8050]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] the people, [[H5971]] “The LORD [[H3068]] is the One who [[H834]] appointed [[H6213]] Moses [[H4872]] and Aaron, [[H175]] and who [[H834]] brought [[H5927]] your fathers [[H1]] up from the land [[H776]] of Egypt. [[H4714]]

### 7
Now [[H6258]] present yourselves, [[H3320]] so I may confront [[H8199]] you [[H854]] before [[H6440]] the LORD [[H3069]] with all [[H3605]] the righteous acts [[H6666]] He [[H3069]] has done [[H6213]] for you [[H854]] and [[H854]] your fathers. [[H1]]

### 8
When [[H834]] Jacob [[H3290]] went [[H935]] to Egypt, [[H4714]] your fathers [[H1]] cried out [[H2199]] to [[H413]] the LORD, [[H3068]] and He [[H3068]] sent [[H7971]] them Moses [[H4872]] and Aaron, [[H175]] who brought [[H3318]] your fathers [[H1]] out of Egypt [[H4714]] and settled [[H3427]] them in this [[H2088]] place. [[H4725]]

### 9
But they forgot [[H7911]] the LORD [[H3068]] their God, [[H430]] and He sold [[H4376]] them [[H853]] into the hand [[H3027]] of Sisera, [[H5516]] the commander [[H8269]] of the army [[H6635]] of Hazor, [[H2674]] and into the hands [[H3027]] of the Philistines [[H6430]] and the king [[H4428]] of Moab, [[H4124]] who fought [[H3898]] against them. 

### 10
Then they cried out [[H2199]] to [[H413]] the LORD [[H3068]] and said, [[H559]] ‘We have sinned, [[H2398]] for [[H3588]] we have forsaken [[H5800]] the LORD [[H3068]] and served [[H5647]] the Baals [[H1168]] and [[H853]] Ashtoreths. [[H6252]] Now [[H6258]] deliver us [[H5337]] from the hands [[H3027]] of our enemies, [[H341]] and we will serve You.’ [[H5647]]

### 11
So the LORD [[H3068]] sent [[H7971]] Jerubbaal, [[H3378]] Barak, [[H917]] Jephthah, [[H3316]] and Samuel, [[H8050]] and delivered [[H5337]] you [[H853]] from the hands [[H3027]] of your enemies [[H341]] on every side, [[H5439]] and you lived [[H3427]] securely. [[H983]]

### 12
But when you saw [[H7200]] that [[H3588]] Nahash [[H5176]] king [[H4428]] of the Ammonites [[H1121]] was moving [[H935]] against you, [[H5921]] you said to me, [[H559]] ‘No, [[H3808]] we must have a king [[H4428]] to rule [[H4427]] over us’— [[H5921]] even though the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] is your king. [[H4428]]

### 13
Now [[H6258]] here [[H2009]] is the king [[H4428]] you have chosen, [[H977]] the one [[H834]] you requested. [[H7592]] Behold, [[H2009]] the king [whom] [[H4428]] the LORD [[H3068]] has placed [[H5414]] over you. [[H5921]]

### 14
If [[H518]] you fear [[H3372]] the LORD [[H3068]] and serve [[H5647]] Him [[H853]] and obey [[H8085]] His voice, [[H6963]] and if you do not [[H3808]] rebel [[H4784]] against [[H854]] the command [[H6310]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] and if both [[H1571]] you [[H859]] and [[H1571]] the king [[H4428]] who [[H834]] rules [[H4427]] over you [[H5921]] follow [[H1961]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God, [then all will be well]. [[H430]]

### 15
But if [[H518]] you disobey [[H3808]] the LORD [[H3068]] and rebel [[H4784]] against His [[H3068]] command, [[H6310]] then the hand [[H3027]] of the LORD [[H3068]] will be [[H1961]] against you  as [it was] against your fathers. [[H1]]

### 16
Now, [[H6258]] therefore, [[H1571]] stand [[H3320]] and see [[H7200]] this [[H2088]] great [[H1419]] thing [[H1697]] that [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] will do [[H6213]] before your eyes. [[H5869]]

### 17
Is it not [[H3808]] the wheat [[H2406]] harvest [[H7105]] today? [[H3117]] I will call [[H7121]] on [[H413]] the LORD [[H3068]] to send [[H5414]] thunder [[H6963]] and rain, [[H4306]] so that you will know [[H3045]] and see [[H7200]] what a great [[H7227]] evil [[H7451]] you have committed [[H6213]] in the sight [[H5869]] of the LORD [[H3068]] by asking [[H7592]] for  a king.” [[H4428]]

### 18
So Samuel [[H8050]] called [[H7121]] to [[H413]] the LORD, [[H3068]] and on that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] the LORD [[H3068]] sent [[H5414]] thunder [[H6963]] and rain. [[H4306]] As a result, all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] greatly [[H3966]] feared [[H3372]] the LORD [[H3068]] and [[H853]] Samuel. [[H8050]]

### 19
They [[H3605]] pleaded [[H559]] with [[H413]] Samuel, [[H8050]] “Pray [[H6419]] to [[H413]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] for [[H1157]] your servants, [[H5650]] so we will not [[H408]] die! [[H4191]] For [[H3588]] we have added [[H3254]] to [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] our sins [[H2403]] the evil [[H7451]] of asking [[H7592]] for  a king. [[H4428]]

### 20
“Do not [[H408]] be afraid,” [[H3372]] Samuel [[H8050]] replied. [[H559]] “Even though you [[H859]] have committed [[H6213]] all [[H3605]] this [[H2063]] evil, [[H7451]] do not [[H408]] turn aside [[H5493]] from following [[H310]] the LORD, [[H3068]] but serve [[H5647]] the LORD [[H3068]] with all [[H3605]] your heart. [[H3824]]

### 21
Do not [[H3808]] turn aside [[H5493]] after [[H310]] worthless [[H8414]] things that [[H834]] cannot [[H3808]] profit [you] [[H3276]] or deliver [you], [[H5337]] for [[H3588]] they [are] [[H1992]] empty. [[H8414]]

### 22
Indeed, [[H3588]] for the sake [[H5668]] of His great [[H1419]] name [[H8034]] the LORD [[H3068]] will not [[H3808]] abandon [[H5203]] His people, [[H5971]] because [He] [[H3068]] was pleased [[H2974]] to make [[H6213]] you [[H853]] His  [own]. [[H5971]]

### 23
As for [[H1571]] me, [[H595]] far be it from me [[H2486]] that I  should sin [[H2398]] against the LORD [[H3068]] by ceasing [[H2308]] to pray [[H6419]] for you. [[H1157]] And I will continue to teach [[H3384]] you [[H853]] the good [[H2896]] and right [[H3477]] way. [[H1870]]

### 24
Above all, [[H389]] fear [[H3372]] the LORD [[H3068]] and serve [[H5647]] Him [[H853]] faithfully [[H571]] with all [[H3605]] your heart; [[H3824]] consider [[H7200]] what [[H834]] great things He has done [[H1431]] for you. [[H5973]]

### 25
But if [[H518]] you persist in doing evil, [[H7489]] both [[H1571]] you [[H859]] and [[H1571]] your king [[H4428]] will be swept away.” [[H5595]]
