###### 1
Now it was reported [[H5046]] to David, [[H1732]] “Look, [[H2009]] the Philistines [[H6430]] are fighting [[H3898]] against Keilah [[H7084]] and looting [[H8154]] the threshing floors.” [[H1637]]

###### 2
So David [[H1732]] inquired [[H7592]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] “Should I go [[H1980]] and attack [[H5221]] these [[H428]] Philistines?” [[H6430]] And the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] David, [[H1732]] “Go [[H1980]] and attack [[H5221]] the Philistines [[H6430]] and deliver [[H3467]] Keilah.” [[H7084]]

###### 3
But David’s [[H1732]] men [[H376]] said [[H559]] to him, [[H413]] “Look, [[H2009]] we [[H587]] are afraid [[H3372]] here [[H6311]] in Judah; [[H3063]] how much more [[H637]] if [[H3588]] we go [[H1980]] to Keilah [[H7084]] against [[H413]] the armies of [[H4634]] the Philistines?” [[H6430]]

###### 4
Once again, [[H3254]] David [[H1732]] inquired [[H7592]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] and the LORD [[H3068]] answered him: [[H6030]] “Go [[H3381]] at once [[H6965]] to Keilah, [[H7084]] for [[H3588]] I [[H589]] will deliver [[H5414]] the Philistines [[H6430]] into your hand.” [[H3027]]

###### 5
Then David [[H1732]] and his men [[H376]] went [[H1980]] to Keilah, [[H7084]] fought [[H3898]] against the Philistines, [[H6430]] and carried off [[H5090]] their livestock, [[H4735]] striking [[H5221]] them  with a mighty [[H1419]] blow. [[H4347]] So David [[H1732]] rescued [[H3467]] the people [[H3427]] of Keilah. [[H7084]]

###### 6
(Now [[H1961]] Abiathar [[H54]] son [[H1121]] of Ahimelech [[H288]] had brought [[H3381]] the ephod [[H646]] with him [[H3027]] when he fled [[H1272]] to [[H413]] David [[H1732]] at Keilah.) [[H7084]]

###### 7
When it was reported [[H5046]] to Saul [[H7586]] that [[H3588]] David [[H1732]] had gone [[H935]] to Keilah, [[H7084]] he [[H7586]] said, [[H559]] “God [[H430]] has delivered [[H5234]] him [[H853]] into my hand, [[H3027]] for [[H3588]] he has trapped himself [[H5462]] by entering [[H935]] a town [[H5892]] with gates [[H1817]] and bars.” [[H1280]]

###### 8
Then Saul [[H7586]] summoned [[H8085]] all [[H3605]] his troops [[H5971]] to go [[H3381]] to war [[H4421]] at Keilah [[H7084]] and besiege [[H6696]] David [[H1732]] and his men. [[H376]]

###### 9
When David [[H1732]] learned [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] Saul [[H7586]] was plotting [[H2790]] evil [[H7451]] against him, [[H5921]] he said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Abiathar [[H54]] the priest, [[H3548]] “Bring [[H5066]] the ephod.” [[H646]]

###### 10
And David [[H1732]] said, [[H559]] “O LORD, [[H3068]] God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] Your servant [[H5650]] has heard [[H8085]] that [[H3588]] Saul [[H7586]] intends [[H1245]] to come [[H935]] to [[H413]] Keilah [[H7084]] and destroy [[H7843]] the city [[H5892]] on my account. [[H5668]]

###### 11
Will the citizens [[H1167]] of Keilah [[H7084]] surrender me [[H5462]] into his hand? [[H3027]] Will Saul [[H7586]] come down, [[H3381]] as [[H834]] Your servant [[H5650]] has heard? [[H8085]] O LORD, [[H3068]] God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] please [[H4994]] tell [[H5046]] Your servant.” [[H5650]] “He will,” [[H3381]] said [[H559]] the LORD. [[H3068]]

###### 12
So David [[H1732]] asked, [[H559]] “Will the citizens [[H1167]] of Keilah [[H7084]] surrender [[H5462]] me [[H853]] and [[H853]] my men [[H376]] into the hand [[H3027]] of Saul?” [[H7586]] “They will,” [[H5462]] answered [[H559]] the LORD. [[H3068]]

###### 13
Then David [[H1732]] and his men, [[H376]] about six [[H8337]] hundred [strong], [[H3967]] set out [[H6965]] and departed [[H3318]] from Keilah, [[H7084]] moving from place to place. [[H1980]] When it was reported [[H5046]] to Saul [[H7586]] that [[H3588]] David [[H1732]] had escaped [[H4422]] from Keilah, [[H7084]] he declined [[H2308]] to go forth. [[H3318]]

###### 14
And David [[H1732]] stayed [[H3427]] in the wilderness [[H4057]] strongholds [[H4679]] and in the hill country [[H2022]] of the Wilderness [[H4057]] of Ziph. [[H2128]] Day [[H3605]] after day [[H3117]] Saul [[H7586]] searched for him, [[H1245]] but God [[H430]] would not [[H3808]] deliver [David] [[H5414]] into his hand. [[H3027]]

###### 15
While David [[H1732]] was in Horesh [[H2793]] in the Wilderness [[H4057]] of Ziph, [[H2128]] he [[H1732]] saw [[H7200]] that [[H3588]] Saul [[H7586]] had come out [[H3318]] to take [[H1245]] his life. [[H5315]]

###### 16
And [[H6965]] Saul’s [[H7586]] son [[H1121]] Jonathan [[H3083]] came [[H1980]] to [[H413]] David [[H1732]] in Horesh [[H2793]] and strengthened [[H2388]] his hand [[H3027]] in God, [[H430]]

###### 17
saying, [[H559]] “Do not [[H408]] be afraid, [[H3372]] for [[H3588]] my father [[H1]] Saul [[H7586]] will never [[H3808]] lay a hand on [[H4672]] you. [[H3027]] And you [[H859]] will be king [[H4427]] over [[H5921]] Israel, [[H3478]] and I will [[H595]] be [[H1961]] your  second-in-command. [[H4932]] Even [[H1571]] my father [[H1]] Saul [[H7586]] knows [[H3045]] this is true. [[H3651]]

###### 18
So the two [[H8147]] of them made [[H3772]] a covenant [[H1285]] before [[H6440]] the LORD. [[H3068]] And David [[H1732]] remained [[H3427]] in Horesh, [[H2793]] while Jonathan [[H3083]] went [[H1980]] home. [[H1004]]

###### 19
Then the Ziphites [[H2130]] came up [[H5927]] to [[H413]] Saul [[H7586]] at Gibeah [[H1390]] and said, [[H559]] “Is not [[H3808]] David [[H1732]] hiding [[H5641]] with us [[H5973]] in strongholds [[H4679]] in Horesh, [[H2793]] on the hill [[H1389]] of Hachilah, [[H2444]] south [[H3225]] of Jeshimon? [[H3452]]

###### 20
Now, [[H6258]] O king, [[H4428]] come down [[H3381]] whenever [[H3605]] your soul [[H5315]] desires, [[H185]] and we will be responsible  for delivering him [[H5462]] into your hands.” [[H3027]]

###### 21
“May you [[H859]] be blessed [[H1288]] by the LORD,” [[H3068]] replied [[H559]] Saul, [[H7586]] “for [[H3588]] you have had compassion [[H2550]] on me. [[H5921]]

###### 22
Please [[H4994]] go [[H1980]] and prepare [[H3559]] further. [[H5750]] Investigate [[H3045]] and watch [[H7200]] carefully where [[H834]] he goes [[H1961]] and who [[H4310]] has seen [[H7200]] him there, [[H8033]] for [[H3588]] I am told that [[H559]] he [[H1931]] is extremely [[H6191]] cunning. [[H6196]]

###### 23
Observe [[H7200]] and find out [[H3045]] all [[H3605]] the places [[H4224]] where [[H834]] he hides. [[H2244]] Then come back [[H7725]] to [[H413]] me with [[H413]] certainty, [[H3559]] and I will go [[H1980]] with you. [[H854]] If [[H518]] he is [[H3426]] in the land, [[H776]] I will search him out [[H2664]] among all [[H3605]] the clans [[H505]] of Judah.” [[H3063]]

###### 24
So they set out [[H6965]] and went [[H1980]] to Ziph [[H2128]] ahead of [[H6440]] Saul. [[H7586]] Now David [[H1732]] and his men [[H376]] were in the Wilderness [[H4057]] of Maon [[H4584]] in the Arabah [[H6160]] south [[H3225]] of Jeshimon, [[H3452]]

###### 25
and Saul [[H7586]] and his men [[H376]] went [[H1980]] to seek [him]. [[H1245]] When David [[H1732]] was told about it, [[H5046]] he went down [[H3381]] to the rock [[H5553]] and stayed [[H3427]] in the Wilderness [[H4057]] of Maon. [[H4584]] And when Saul [[H7586]] heard of this, [[H8085]] he pursued [[H7291]] David [[H1732]] there. [[H4057]]

###### 26
Saul [[H7586]] was proceeding along [[H1980]] one [[H2088]] side [[H6654]] of the mountain, [[H2022]] and David [[H1732]] and his men [[H376]] along the other [[H2088]] side. [[H6654]] Even though David [[H1732]] was hurrying [[H2648]] to get away, [[H1980]] Saul [[H7586]] and his men [[H376]] were closing [[H5849]] in on [[H413]] David [[H1732]] and his men [[H376]] to capture them. [[H8610]]

###### 27
Then a messenger [[H4397]] came [[H935]] to [[H413]] Saul, [[H7586]] saying, [[H559]] “Come [[H1980]] quickly, [[H4116]] for [[H3588]] the Philistines [[H6430]] have raided [[H6584]] the land!” [[H776]]

###### 28
So Saul [[H7586]] broke off [[H7725]] his pursuit [[H7291]] of David [[H1732]] and went [[H1980]] to meet [[H7122]] the Philistines. [[H6430]] That is why [[H5921]] that [[H1931]] place [[H4725]] is called [[H7121]] the Rock of Escape. [[H5555]]

###### 29
And David [[H1732]] went up [[H5927]] from there [[H8033]] and lived [[H3427]] in the strongholds [[H4679]] of En-gedi. [[H5872]]
