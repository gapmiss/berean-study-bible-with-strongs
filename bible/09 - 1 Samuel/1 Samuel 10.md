###### 1
Then Samuel [[H8050]] took [[H3947]] a flask [[H6378]] of oil, [[H8081]] poured it out [[H3332]] on [[H5921]] Saul’s head, [[H7218]] kissed him, [[H5401]] and said, [[H559]] “Has not [[H3808]] the LORD [[H3068]] anointed you [[H4886]] ruler [[H5057]] over [[H5921]] His inheritance? [[H5159]]

###### 2
When you leave [[H1980]] me [[H5978]] today, [[H3117]] you will find [[H4672]] two [[H8147]] men [[H376]] at [[H5973]] Rachel’s [[H7354]] tomb [[H6900]] in Zelzah [[H6766]] on the border [[H1366]] of Benjamin. [[H1144]] They will say [[H559]] to you, [[H413]] ‘The donkeys [[H860]] you seek [[H1980]] have been found, [[H4672]] and now [[H2009]] your father [[H1]] has stopped [[H5203]] worrying about [[H1697]] the donkeys [[H860]] and is worrying [[H1672]] about you,  asking, [[H559]] What [[H4100]] should I do [[H6213]] about my son?’ [[H1121]]

###### 3
Then you will go [[H2498]] on [[H1973]] from there [[H8033]] until you come [[H935]] to [[H5704]] the oak [[H436]] of Tabor. [[H8396]] Three [[H7969]] men [[H582]] going up [[H5927]] to [[H413]] God [[H430]] at Bethel [[H1008]] will meet you [[H4672]] there, [[H8033]] one [[H259]] carrying [[H5375]] three [[H7969]] young goats, [[H1423]] another [[H259]] carrying [[H5375]] three [[H7969]] loaves [[H3603]] of bread, [[H3899]] and another [[H259]] carrying [[H5375]] a skin [[H5035]] of wine. [[H3196]]

###### 4
They will greet [[H7592]] you  and give [[H5414]] you  two [[H8147]] [loaves] of bread, [[H3899]] which you will accept [[H3947]] from their hands. [[H3027]]

###### 5
After [[H310]] that [[H3651]] you will come [[H935]] to Gibeah [[H1389]] of God, [[H430]] where [[H834]] the Philistines [[H6430]] [have] an outpost. [[H5333]] As you approach [[H935]] the city, [[H5892]] you will meet [[H6293]] a group [[H2256]] of prophets [[H5030]] coming down [[H3381]] from the high place, [[H1116]] preceded [[H6440]] by harps, [[H5035]] tambourines, [[H8596]] flutes, [[H2485]] and lyres, [[H3658]] and they [[H1992]] will be prophesying. [[H5012]]

###### 6
Then the Spirit [[H7307]] of the LORD [[H3068]] will rush [[H6743]] upon you, [[H5921]] and you will prophesy [[H5012]] with them; [[H5973]] and you will be transformed [[H2015]] into a different [[H312]] person. [[H376]]

###### 7
When [[H3588]] these [[H428]] signs [[H226]] have come, [[H935]] do [[H6213]] as the occasion [[H834]] demands, [[H4672]] for [[H3588]] God [is] [[H430]] with you. [[H5973]]

###### 8
And you shall go [[H3381]] before [[H6440]] me to Gilgal, [[H1537]] and surely [[H2009]] I [[H595]] will come [[H3381]] to you [[H413]] to offer [[H5927]] burnt offerings [[H5930]] and to sacrifice [[H2076]] peace offerings. [[H8002]] Wait [[H3176]] seven [[H7651]] days [[H3117]] until [[H5704]] I come [[H935]] to you [[H413]] and show [[H3045]] you  what [[H834]] you are to do. [[H6213]]

###### 9
As Saul turned [[H6437]] to leave [[H1980]] Samuel, [[H8050]] God [[H430]] changed [[H2015]] Saul's heart, [[H3820]] and all [[H3605]] the signs [[H226]] came to pass [[H935]] that [[H1931]] day. [[H3117]]

###### 10
When Saul and his servant arrived [[H935]] at Gibeah, [[H1389]] a group [[H2256]] of prophets [[H5030]] met him. [[H7122]] Then the Spirit [[H7307]] of God [[H430]] rushed [[H6743]] upon him, [[H5921]] and he prophesied [[H5012]] along with them. [[H8432]]

###### 11
All those [[H3605]] who had formerly [[H865]] known [Saul] [[H3045]] and saw [[H7200]] him prophesying [[H5012]] with [[H5973]] the prophets [[H5030]] asked [[H559]] one [[H376]] another, [[H7453]] “What [[H4100]] has happened [[H1961]] to the son [[H1121]] of Kish? [[H7027]] Is Saul [[H7586]] also [[H1571]] among the prophets?” [[H5030]]

###### 12
Then a man [[H376]] who lived there [[H8033]] replied, [[H6030]] “And who [[H4310]] is their father?” [[H1]] So the saying [[H3651]] became [[H1961]] a proverb: [[H4912]] “Is Saul [[H7586]] also [[H1571]] among the prophets?” [[H5030]]

###### 13
And when Saul had finished [[H3615]] prophesying, [[H5012]] he went [[H935]] to the high place. [[H1116]]

###### 14
Now Saul's [[H7586]] uncle [[H1730]] asked him [[H559]] and his servant, [[H5288]] “Where [[H575]] did you go?” [[H1980]] “To look for [[H1245]] the donkeys,” [[H860]] Saul replied. [[H559]] “When we saw [[H7200]] they were not to be found, [[H369]] we went [[H935]] to [[H413]] Samuel.” [[H8050]]

###### 15
“Tell me,” [[H5046]] Saul’s [[H7586]] uncle [[H1730]] asked, [[H559]] “what [[H4100]] did Samuel [[H8050]] say to you?” [[H559]]

###### 16
And Saul [[H7586]] replied, [[H559]] “He assured us [[H5046]] that the donkeys [[H860]] had been found.” [[H4672]] But Saul did not [[H3808]] tell [[H5046]] [his uncle]  what [[H834]] Samuel [[H8050]] had said [[H559]] about [[H1697]] the kingship. [[H4410]]

###### 17
After this, Samuel [[H8050]] summoned [[H6817]] the people [[H5971]] to [[H413]] the LORD [[H3068]] at Mizpah [[H4709]]

###### 18
and said [[H559]] to [[H413]] the Israelites, [[H1121]] “This is what [[H3541]] the LORD, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] says: [[H559]] ‘I [[H595]] brought [[H5927]] Israel [[H3478]] up out of Egypt, [[H4714]] and I rescued [[H5337]] you [[H853]] from the hands [[H3027]] of the Egyptians [[H4714]] and of all [[H3605]] the kingdoms [[H4467]] that oppressed you.’ [[H3905]]

###### 19
But today [[H3117]] you [[H859]] have rejected [[H3988]] your God, [[H430]] who [[H834]] delivers [[H3467]] you  from all [[H3605]] your troubles [[H7451]] and afflictions, [[H6869]] and you have said [[H559]] to Him,  ‘No, [[H3588]] set [[H7760]] a king [[H4428]] over us.’ [[H5921]] Now therefore [[H6258]] present yourselves [[H3320]] before [[H6440]] the LORD [[H3068]] by your tribes [[H7626]] and clans. [[H505]]

###### 20
Thus Samuel [[H8050]] had all [[H3605]] the tribes [[H7626]] of Israel [[H3478]] come forward, [[H7126]] and the tribe [[H7626]] of Benjamin [[H1144]] was selected. [[H3920]]

###### 21
Then he had the tribe [[H7626]] of Benjamin [[H1144]] come forward [[H7126]] by its clans, [[H4940]] and the clan [[H4940]] of Matri [[H4309]] was selected. [[H3920]] Finally, Saul [[H7586]] son [[H1121]] of Kish [[H7027]] was selected. [[H3920]] But when they looked for him, [[H1245]] they could not [[H3808]] find him. [[H4672]]

###### 22
So again [[H5750]] they inquired [[H7592]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] “Has the man [[H376]] come [[H935]] here [[H1988]] yet?” [[H5750]] And the LORD [[H3068]] replied, [[H559]] “Behold, [[H2009]] he has hidden [[H2244]] himself [[H1931]] among [[H413]] the baggage.” [[H3627]]

###### 23
So they ran [[H7323]] and brought [Saul], [[H3947]] and when he stood [[H3320]] among [[H8432]] the people, [[H5971]] he was a head [[H7926]] taller [[H1361]] than any [[H3605]] of the others. [[H5971]]

###### 24
Samuel [[H8050]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] all [[H3605]] the people, [[H5971]] “Do you see [[H7200]] the one [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] has chosen? [[H977]] [There is] no one [[H369]] like him [[H3644]] among all [[H3605]] the people.” [[H5971]] And all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] shouted, [[H7321]] “Long live [[H2421]] the king!” [[H4428]]

###### 25
Then Samuel [[H8050]] explained [[H1696]] to [[H413]] the people [[H5971]] the rights [[H4941]] of kingship. [[H4410]] He wrote them [[H3789]] on a scroll [[H5612]] and laid [it] up [[H3240]] before [[H6440]] the LORD. [[H3068]] And Samuel [[H8050]] sent all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] away, [[H7971]] each [[H376]] to his home. [[H1004]]

###### 26
Saul [[H7586]] also [[H1571]] went [[H1980]] to his home [[H1004]] in Gibeah, [[H1390]] and the [men] of valor [[H2428]] whose [[H834]] hearts [[H3820]] God [[H430]] had touched [[H5060]] went [[H1980]] with him. [[H5973]]

###### 27
But some worthless [[H1100]] men [[H1121]] said, [[H559]] “How [[H4100]] can this [man] [[H2088]] deliver us?” [[H3467]] So they despised him [[H959]] and brought [[H935]] him  no [[H3808]] gifts; [[H4503]] but [Saul] held [[H1961]] his peace. [[H2790]]
