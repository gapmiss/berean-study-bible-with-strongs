[[Deuteronomy 28|←]] • [[Deuteronomy 30|→]]

---

###### 1
These [[H428]] are the words [[H1697]] of the covenant [[H1285]] the LORD [[H3068]] commanded [[H6680]] Moses [[H4872]] to make [[H3772]] with [[H854]] the Israelites [[H1121]] in the land [[H776]] of Moab, [[H4124]] in addition to [[H905]] the covenant [[H1285]] He had made [[H3772]] with [[H854]] them at Horeb. [[H2722]]

###### 2
Moses [[H4872]] summoned [[H7121]] all [[H3605]] Israel [[H3478]] and proclaimed [[H559]] to them, [[H413]] “You [[H859]] have seen [[H7200]] with your own eyes [[H5869]] everything [[H3605]] the LORD [[H3068]] did [[H6213]] in Egypt [[H4714]] to Pharaoh, [[H6547]] to all [[H3605]] his officials, [[H5650]] and to all [[H3605]] his land. [[H776]]

###### 3
You saw [[H7200]] with your own eyes [[H5869]] the great [[H1419]] trials, [[H4531]] and those [[H1992]] miraculous [[H1419]] signs [[H226]] and wonders. [[H4159]]

###### 4
Yet to [[H5704]] this [[H2088]] day [[H3117]] the LORD [[H3068]] has not [[H3808]] given [[H5414]] you a mind [[H3820]] to understand, [[H3045]] eyes [[H5869]] to see, [[H7200]] or ears [[H241]] to hear. [[H8085]]

###### 5
During the forty [[H705]] years [[H8141]] I led [[H1980]] you [[H853]] in the wilderness, [[H4057]] neither your clothes [[H8008]] nor the sandals [[H5275]] on [[H5921]] your feet [[H7272]] wore out; [[H1086]]

###### 6
you did not [[H3808]] eat [[H398]] bread [[H3899]] or drink [[H8354]] wine [[H3196]] or strong drink, [[H7941]] so that [[H4616]] you might know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I [[H589]] am the LORD [[H3068]] your God. [[H430]]

###### 7
When you reached [[H935]] this [[H2088]] place, [[H4725]] Sihon [[H5511]] king [[H4428]] of Heshbon [[H2809]] and Og [[H5747]] king [[H4428]] of Bashan [[H1316]] came out [[H3318]] against us [[H7125]] in battle, [[H4421]] but we defeated them. [[H5221]]

###### 8
We took [[H3947]] their land [[H776]] and gave [[H5414]] it as an inheritance [[H5159]] to the Reubenites, [[H7206]] the Gadites, [[H1425]] and the half-tribe [[H2677]] of Manasseh. [[H4520]]

###### 9
So keep [[H8104]] and follow [[H6213]] the words [[H1697]] of this [[H2063]] covenant, [[H1285]] that [[H4616]] you may prosper [[H7919]] in all [[H3605]] you do. [[H6213]]

###### 10
All [[H3605]] of you [[H859]] are standing [[H5324]] today [[H3117]] before [[H6440]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God— [[H430]] you leaders [[H7218]] of tribes, [[H7626]] elders, [[H2205]] officials, [[H7860]] and all [[H3605]] the men [[H376]] of Israel, [[H3478]]

###### 11
you children, [[H2945]] wives, [[H802]] and the foreigners [[H1616]] in [[H7130]] your camps [[H4264]] who cut [[H2404]] your wood [[H6086]] and draw [[H7579]] your water— [[H4325]]

###### 12
so that you may enter [[H5674]] into the covenant [[H1285]] of the LORD [[H3068]] your God, [[H430]] which [[H834]] He [[H3068]] is making [[H3772]] with you today, [[H5973]] and into His oath, [[H423]]

###### 13
and so that [[H4616]] He may establish [[H6965]] you [[H853]] today [[H3117]] as His people, [[H5971]] and He [[H1931]] may be [[H1961]] your God [[H430]] as [[H834]] He promised [[H1696]] you  and as [[H834]] He swore [[H7650]] to your fathers, [[H1]] Abraham, [[H85]] Isaac, [[H3327]] and Jacob. [[H3290]]

###### 14
I [[H595]] am making [[H3772]] this [[H2063]] covenant [[H1285]] and this [[H2063]] oath [[H423]] not [[H3808]] only [[H905]] with you, [[H854]]

###### 15
but [[H3588]] also with [[H854]] those who [[H834]] are standing [[H5975]] here [[H6311]] with us [[H5973]] today [[H3117]] in the presence [[H6440]] of the LORD [[H3068]] our God, [[H430]] as well as [[H854]] with those who [[H834]] are not [[H369]] here today. [[H6311]]

###### 16
For [[H3588]] you yourselves [[H859]] know [[H3045]] how [[H834]] we lived [[H3427]] in the land [[H776]] of Egypt [[H4714]] and passed [[H5674]] through [[H7130]] the nations [[H1471]] as you traveled. [[H5674]]

###### 17
You saw [[H7200]] the abominations [[H8251]] and idols [[H1544]] among them [[H5973]] made of wood [[H6086]] and stone, [[H68]] of silver [[H3701]] and gold. [[H2091]]

###### 18
Make sure there is [[H3426]] no [[H6435]] man [[H376]] or woman, [[H802]] clan [[H4940]] or [[H176]] tribe [[H7626]] among you  today [[H3117]] whose [[H834]] heart [[H3824]] turns away [[H6437]] from [[H5973]] the LORD [[H3068]] our God [[H430]] to go [[H1980]] and worship [[H5647]] the gods [[H430]] of those [[H1992]] nations. [[H1471]] Make sure there is [[H3426]] no [[H6435]] root [[H8328]] among you  that bears [[H6509]] such poisonous [[H7219]] and bitter fruit, [[H3939]]

###### 19
because when such a person hears [[H8085]] the words [[H1697]] of this [[H2063]] oath, [[H423]] he may invoke a blessing [[H1288]] on himself, [[H3824]] saying, [[H559]] ‘I will have [[H1961]] peace, [[H7965]] even though [[H3588]] I walk [[H1980]] in the stubbornness [[H8307]] of my own heart.’ [[H3820]] This will bring disaster [[H5595]] on the watered [land] [[H7302]] as well as [[H853]] the dry. [[H6771]]

###### 20
The LORD [[H3068]] will never [[H3808]] be willing [[H14]] to forgive him. [[H5545]] Instead, [[H3588]] [His] [[H3068]] anger [[H639]] and jealousy [[H7068]] will burn [[H6225]] against that [[H1931]] man, [[H376]] and every [[H3605]] curse [[H423]] written [[H3789]] in this [[H2088]] book [[H5612]] will fall [[H7257]] upon him.  The LORD [[H3068]] will blot out [[H4229]] his name [[H8034]] from under [[H8478]] heaven [[H8064]]

###### 21
and single him out [[H914]] for disaster [[H7451]] from all [[H3605]] the tribes [[H7626]] of Israel, [[H3478]] according to all [[H3605]] the curses [[H423]] of the covenant [[H1285]] written [[H3789]] in this [[H2088]] Book [[H5612]] of the Law. [[H8451]]

###### 22
Then the generation [[H1755]] to come— [[H314]] your sons [[H1121]] who [[H834]] follow [[H6965]] you [[H310]] and the foreigner [[H5237]] who [[H834]] comes [[H935]] from a distant [[H7350]] land— [[H776]] will see [[H7200]] the plagues [[H4347]] of the land [[H776]] and the sicknesses [[H8463]] the LORD [[H3068]] has inflicted on it. [[H2470]]

###### 23
All [[H3605]] its soil [[H776]] will be a burning waste [[H8316]] of brimstone [[H1614]] and salt, [[H4417]] unsown [[H3808]] and unproductive, [[H6779]] with no [[H3808]] plant [[H6212]] growing on it, [[H5927]] just like the destruction [[H4114]] of Sodom [[H5467]] and Gomorrah, [[H6017]] Admah [[H126]] and Zeboiim, [[H6636]] which [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] overthrew [[H2015]] in His fierce anger. [[H639]]

###### 24
All [[H3605]] the nations [[H1471]] will ask, [[H559]] ‘Why [[H5921]] has the LORD [[H3068]] done [[H6213]] this [[H3602]] to this [[H2063]] land? [[H776]] Why [[H4100]] this [[H2088]] great [[H1419]] outburst [[H2750]] of anger?’ [[H639]]

###### 25
And [the people] will answer, [[H559]] ‘It is because [[H5921]] they abandoned [[H5800]] the covenant [[H1285]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of their fathers, [[H1]] which [[H834]] He made [[H3772]] with [[H5973]] them when He brought [[H3318]] them [[H853]] out of the land [[H776]] of Egypt. [[H4714]]

###### 26
They went [[H1980]] and served [[H5647]] other [[H312]] gods, [[H430]] and they worshiped [[H7812]] gods [[H430]] they had not [[H3808]] known— [[H3045]] gods that [the LORD] had not [[H3808]] given [[H2505]] to them. 

###### 27
Therefore the LORD’s [[H3068]] anger [[H639]] burned [[H2734]] against this [[H1931]] land, [[H776]] and He brought [[H935]] upon it [[H5921]] every [[H3605]] curse [[H7045]] written [[H3789]] in this [[H2088]] book. [[H5612]]

###### 28
The LORD [[H3068]] uprooted [[H5428]] them from [[H5921]] their land [[H127]] in His anger, [[H639]] rage, [[H2534]] and great [[H1419]] wrath, [[H7110]] and He cast them [[H7993]] into [[H413]] another [[H312]] land, [[H776]] where they are today.’ [[H3117]]

###### 29
The secret [things belong] [[H5641]] to the LORD [[H3068]] our God, [[H430]] but the things revealed [[H1540]] belong to us  and to our children [[H1121]] forever, [[H5704]] so that we may follow [[H6213]] all [[H3605]] the words [[H1697]] of this [[H2063]] law. [[H8451]]
