[[Deuteronomy 20|←]] • [[Deuteronomy 22|→]]

###### 1
If [[H3588]] [one] is found [[H4672]] slain, [[H2491]] lying [[H5307]] in a field [[H7704]] in the land [[H127]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] is giving [[H5414]] you  to possess, [[H3423]] and it is not [[H3808]] known [[H3045]] who [[H4310]] killed him, [[H5221]]

###### 2
your elders [[H2205]] and judges [[H8199]] must come out [[H3318]] and measure the distance [[H4058]] from the victim [[H2491]] to [[H413]] the neighboring [[H5439]] cities. [[H5892]]

###### 3
Then [[H1961]] the elders [[H2205]] of the city [[H5892]] nearest [[H7138]] the victim [[H2491]] shall take [[H3947]] a heifer [[H5697]] that [[H834]] has never [[H3808]] been yoked [[H5923]] or used for work, [[H5647]]

###### 4
bring [[H3381]] the heifer [[H5697]] to [[H413]] a valley [[H5158]] with running water [[H386]] that [[H834]] has not [[H3808]] been plowed [[H5647]] or sown, [[H2232]] and break its [[H5697]] neck [[H6202]] there [[H8033]] by the stream. [[H5158]]

###### 5
And the priests, [[H3548]] the sons [[H1121]] of Levi, [[H3878]] shall come forward, [[H5066]] for [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] has chosen [[H977]] them to serve [[H8334]] Him and pronounce blessings [[H1288]] in His [[H3068]] name [[H8034]] and to give a ruling [[H5921]] in every [[H3605]] dispute [[H7379]] and case of assault. [[H5061]]

###### 6
Then all [[H3605]] the elders [[H2205]] of the city [[H5892]] nearest [[H7138]] the victim [[H2491]] shall wash [[H7364]] their hands [[H3027]] by the stream [[H5158]] over [[H5921]] the heifer [[H5697]] whose neck has been broken, [[H6202]]

###### 7
and they shall declare, [[H6030]] “Our hands [[H3027]] did not [[H3808]] shed [[H8210]] this [[H2088]] blood, [[H1818]] nor did [[H3808]] our eyes [[H5869]] see it. [[H7200]]

###### 8
Accept this atonement, [[H3722]] O LORD, [[H3068]] for Your people [[H5971]] Israel [[H3478]] whom [[H834]] You have redeemed, [[H6299]] and do not [[H408]] hold [[H5414]] the shedding of innocent [[H5355]] blood [[H1818]] against [[H7130]] them.” [[H5971]] And the bloodshed [[H1818]] will be atoned for. [[H3722]]

###### 9
So you [[H859]] shall purge [[H1197]] from among you [[H7130]] the guilt of shedding innocent [[H5355]] blood, [[H1818]] since [[H3588]] you have done [[H6213]] what is right [[H3477]] in the eyes [[H5869]] of the LORD. [[H3068]]

###### 10
When [[H3588]] you go [[H3318]] to war [[H4421]] against [[H5921]] your enemies [[H341]] and the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] delivers them [[H5414]] into your hands [[H3027]] and you take [[H7617]] them captive, [[H7617]]

###### 11
if you see [[H7200]] a beautiful [[H3303]] woman [[H802]] among [them], [[H7633]] and you desire [[H2836]] her  and want to take [[H3947]] her as your wife, [[H802]]

###### 12
then you shall bring [[H935]] her into [[H413]] your house. [[H1004]] She must shave [[H1548]] her head, [[H7218]] trim [[H6213]] her nails, [[H6856]]

###### 13
and put aside [[H5493]] the clothes [[H8071]] of her captivity. [[H7633]] After [[H310]] she has lived [[H3427]] in your house [[H1004]] a full month [[H3391]] and mourned [[H1058]] her father [[H1]] and mother, [[H517]] you may have relations with [[H935]] her [[H413]] and be her husband, [[H1167]] and she shall be [[H1961]] your wife. [[H802]]

###### 14
And [[H1961]] if [[H518]] you are not [[H3808]] pleased with her, [[H2654]] you are to let her go [[H7971]] wherever she wishes. [[H5315]] But you must not [[H3808]] sell [[H4376]] her for money [[H3701]] or treat her as a slave, [[H6014]] since [[H8478]] you have dishonored her. [[H6031]]

###### 15
If [[H3588]] a man [[H376]] has [[H1961]] two [[H8147]] wives, [[H802]] one [[H259]] beloved [[H157]] and the other [[H259]] unloved, [[H8130]] and [both] [[H157]] bear [[H3205]] him sons, [[H1121]] but the unloved [[H8146]] wife has [[H1961]] the firstborn [[H1060]] son, [[H1121]]

###### 16
when [[H3117]] that man [[H834]] assigns his inheritance [[H5157]] to his sons [[H1121]] he must not [appoint] [[H3808]] the son [[H1121]] of the beloved wife [[H157]] as the firstborn [[H6440]] over [[H1121]] [the son] [[H1060]] of the unloved wife. [[H8130]]

###### 17
Instead, [[H3588]] he must acknowledge [[H5234]] the firstborn, [[H1060]] the son [[H1121]] of his unloved wife, [[H8130]] by giving [[H5414]] him  a double [[H8147]] portion [[H6310]] of all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] he has. [[H4672]] For [[H3588]] [that son] [[H1931]] is the firstfruits [[H7225]] of his [father’s] strength; [[H202]] the right [[H4941]] of the firstborn [[H1062]] belongs to him. 

###### 18
If [[H3588]] a man [[H376]] has [[H1961]] a stubborn [[H5637]] and rebellious [[H4784]] son [[H1121]] who does not [[H369]] obey [[H8085]] his father [[H1]] and mother, [[H517]] [or] [[H3808]] listen [[H8085]] to them [[H413]] when disciplined, [[H3256]]

###### 19
his father [[H1]] and mother [[H517]] are to lay hold [[H8610]] of him  and bring [[H3318]] him to [[H413]] the elders [[H2205]] of his city, [[H5892]] to [[H413]] the gate [[H8179]] of his hometown, [[H4725]]

###### 20
and say [[H559]] to [[H413]] the elders, [[H2205]] “This [[H2088]] son of ours [[H1121]] is stubborn [[H5637]] and rebellious; [[H4784]] he does not [[H369]] obey us. [[H8085]] He is a glutton [[H2151]] and a drunkard.” [[H5435]]

###### 21
Then all [[H3605]] the men [[H376]] of his city [[H5892]] will stone [[H7275]] him to death. [[H4191]] You must purge [[H1197]] the evil [[H7451]] from among you, [[H7130]] and all [[H3605]] Israel [[H3478]] will hear [[H8085]] and be afraid. [[H3372]]

###### 22
If [[H3588]] a man [[H376]] has committed [[H1961]] a sin [[H2399]] worthy [[H4941]] of death, [[H4194]] and he is executed, [[H4191]] and you hang [[H8518]] his body [[H853]] on [[H5921]] a tree, [[H6086]]

###### 23
you must not leave [[H3808]] the body [[H5038]] on [[H5921]] the tree [[H6086]] overnight, [[H3885]] but [[H3588]] you must be sure to bury [[H6912]] him [[H1931]] that day, [[H3117]] because [[H3588]] anyone who is hung on a tree [[H8518]] is under God’s [[H430]] curse. [[H7045]] You must not [[H3808]] defile [[H2930]] the land [[H127]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] is giving [[H5414]] you  as an inheritance. [[H5159]]
