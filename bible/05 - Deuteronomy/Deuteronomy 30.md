[[Deuteronomy 29|←]] • [[Deuteronomy 31|→]]

###### 1
When [[H3588]] all [[H3605]] these [[H428]] things [[H1697]] come [[H935]] upon you— [[H5921]] the blessings [[H1293]] and curses [[H7045]] I have set [[H5414]] before you— [[H6440]] and you call [them] [[H7725]] to [[H413]] mind [[H3824]] in all [[H3605]] the nations [[H1471]] to which [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] has banished you, [[H5080]]

###### 2
and when you [[H859]] and your children [[H1121]] return [[H7725]] to [[H5704]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] and obey [[H8085]] His voice [[H6963]] with all [[H3605]] your heart [[H3824]] and all [[H3605]] your soul [[H5315]] according to everything [[H3605]] I [[H595]] am giving you today, [[H6680]]

###### 3
then He [[H3068]] will restore [[H7725]] you from captivity [[H7622]] and have compassion on you [[H7355]] and gather you [[H6908]] from all [[H3605]] the nations [[H5971]] to which [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] has scattered you. [[H6327]]

###### 4
Even if [[H518]] you have been banished [[H5080]] to the ends [[H7097]] of the earth, [[H8064]] He [[H3068]] will gather you [[H6908]] and return you [[H3947]] from there. [[H8033]]

###### 5
And the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] will bring you [[H935]] into [[H413]] the land [[H776]] your fathers [[H1]] possessed, [[H3423]] and you will take possession of it. [[H3423]] He will cause you to prosper [[H3190]] and multiply you [[H7235]] more than your fathers. [[H1]]

###### 6
The LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] will circumcise [[H4135]] your hearts [[H3824]] and the hearts [[H3824]] of your descendants, [[H2233]] and you will love [[H157]] Him [[H3068]] with all [[H3605]] your heart [[H3824]] and all [[H3605]] your soul, [[H5315]] so that [[H4616]] you may live. [[H2416]]

###### 7
Then the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] will put [[H5414]] all [[H3605]] these [[H428]] curses [[H423]] upon [[H5921]] your enemies [[H341]] who [[H834]] hate you [[H8130]] and persecute you. [[H7291]]

###### 8
And you [[H859]] will again [[H7725]] obey [[H8085]] the voice [[H6963]] of the LORD [[H3068]] and follow [[H6213]] all [[H3605]] His commandments [[H4687]] I [[H595]] am giving you today. [[H6680]]

###### 9
So the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] will make you abound [[H3498]] in all [[H3605]] the work [[H4639]] of your hands [[H3027]] [and] in the fruit [[H6529]] of your womb, [[H990]] the offspring [[H6529]] of your livestock, [[H929]] and the produce [[H6529]] of your land. [[H127]] Indeed, the LORD [[H3068]] will again [[H7725]] delight [[H7797]] in [[H5921]] your prosperity, [[H2896]] as [[H834]] He delighted [[H7797]] in [[H5921]] that of your fathers, [[H1]]

###### 10
if [[H3588]] you obey [[H8085]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] by keeping [[H8104]] His commandments [[H4687]] and statutes [[H2708]] that are written [[H3789]] in this [[H2088]] book [[H5612]] of the law, [[H8451]] [and] if [[H3588]] you turn [[H7725]] to [[H413]] Him [[H3068]] with all [[H3605]] your heart [[H3824]] and all [[H3605]] your soul. [[H5315]]

###### 11
For [[H3588]] this [[H2063]] commandment [[H4687]] I [[H595]] give [[H6680]] you today [[H3117]] is not [[H3808]] too difficult [[H6381]] for you [[H4480]] or [[H3808]] beyond your reach. [[H7350]]

###### 12
It [[H1931]] is not [[H3808]] in heaven, [[H8064]] that you would need to ask, [[H559]] “Who [[H4310]] will ascend [[H5927]] into  heaven [[H8064]] to get it [[H3947]] for us  and proclaim [[H8085]] it, [[H853]] that we may obey it?” [[H6213]]

###### 13
And it [[H1931]] is not [[H3808]] beyond [[H5676]] the sea, [[H3220]] that you would need to ask, [[H559]] “Who [[H4310]] will cross [[H5674]] the sea [[H3220]] to get it [[H3947]] for us  and proclaim [[H8085]] it, [[H853]] that we may obey it?” [[H6213]]

###### 14
But [[H3588]] the word [is] [[H1697]] very [[H3966]] near [[H7138]] you, [[H413]] in your mouth [[H6310]] and in your heart, [[H3824]] so that you may obey it. [[H6213]]

###### 15
See, [[H7200]] I have set [[H5414]] before you [[H6440]] today [[H3117]] life [[H2416]] and prosperity, [[H2896]] as well as [[H853]] death [[H4194]] and disaster. [[H7451]]

###### 16
For [[H834]] I [[H595]] am commanding [[H6680]] you today [[H3117]] to love [[H157]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God, [[H430]] to walk [[H1980]] in His ways, [[H1870]] and to keep [[H8104]] His commandments, [[H4687]] statutes, [[H2708]] and ordinances, [[H4941]] so that you may live [[H2421]] and increase, [[H7235]] and the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] may bless [[H1288]] you in the land [[H776]] you [[H859]] are entering [[H935]] to possess. [[H3423]]

###### 17
But if [[H518]] your heart [[H3824]] turns away [[H6437]] and you do not [[H3808]] listen, [[H8085]] but are drawn away [[H5080]] to bow down [[H7812]] to other [[H312]] gods [[H430]] and worship them, [[H5647]]

###### 18
I declare [[H5046]] to you  today [[H3117]] that [[H3588]] you will surely perish; [[H6]] you shall not prolong [[H748]] [your] days [[H3117]] in [[H5921]] the land [[H127]] you [[H859]] are crossing [[H5674]] the Jordan [[H3383]] to possess. [[H3423]]

###### 19
I call heaven [[H8064]] and earth [[H776]] as witnesses [[H5749]] against you  today [[H3117]] that I have set [[H5414]] before [[H6440]] you life [[H2416]] and death, [[H4194]] blessing [[H1293]] and cursing. [[H7045]] So choose [[H977]] life, [[H2416]] so that [[H4616]] you [[H859]] and your descendants [[H2233]] may live, [[H2421]]

###### 20
and that you may love [[H157]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God, [[H430]] obey Him, [[H8085]] and hold fast [[H1692]] to Him.  For [[H3588]] He [is] [[H1931]] your life, [[H2416]] and He will prolong [[H753]] your life [[H3117]] in [[H5921]] the land [[H127]] the LORD [[H3068]] swore [[H7650]] to give [[H5414]] to your fathers, [[H1]] Abraham, [[H85]] Isaac, [[H3327]] and Jacob.
