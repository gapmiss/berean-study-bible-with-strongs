### 1
Then we turned [[H6437]] and went up [[H5927]] the road [[H1870]] to Bashan, [[H1316]] and Og [[H5747]] king [[H4428]] of Bashan [[H1316]] and his whole [[H3605]] army [[H5971]] came out [[H3318]] to meet us [[H7125]] in battle [[H4421]] at Edrei. [[H154]]

### 2
But the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H559]] to me, [[H413]] “Do not [[H408]] fear him, [[H3372]] for [[H3588]] I have handed him over to you [[H3027]] along with [[H853]] all [[H3605]] his people [[H5971]] and his land. [[H776]] Do [[H6213]] to him as [[H834]] you did [[H6213]] to Sihon [[H5511]] king [[H4428]] of the Amorites, [[H567]] who [[H834]] lived [[H3427]] in Heshbon.” [[H2809]]

### 3
So the LORD [[H3068]] our God [[H430]] also [[H1571]] handed over Og [[H5747]] king [[H4428]] of Bashan [[H1316]] and his whole [[H3605]] army [[H5971]] to [[H5414]] us. [[H3027]] We struck them down [[H5221]] until no [[H1115]] survivor [[H8300]] was left. [[H7604]]

### 4
At that [[H1931]] time [[H6256]] we captured [[H3920]] all [[H3605]] sixty [[H8346]] of his cities. [[H5892]] There was not [[H3808]] a single city [[H7151]] we failed to [[H3808]] take— [[H3947]] the entire [[H3605]] region [[H2256]] of Argob, [[H709]] the kingdom [[H4467]] of Og [[H5747]] in Bashan. [[H1316]]

### 5
All [[H3605]] these [[H428]] cities [[H5892]] were fortified [[H1219]] with high [[H1364]] walls [[H2346]] and gates [[H1817]] and bars, [[H1280]] and there were [[H905]] many more [[H7235]] unwalled villages. [[H6521]]

### 6
We completely destroyed [[H2763]] them, [[H853]] as [[H834]] we had done [[H6213]] to Sihon [[H5511]] king [[H4428]] of Heshbon, [[H2809]] destroying [[H2763]] the men, [[H4962]] women, [[H802]] and children [[H2945]] of every [[H3605]] city. [[H5892]]

### 7
But all [[H3605]] the livestock [[H929]] and plunder [[H7998]] of the cities [[H5892]] we carried off [[H962]] for ourselves. 

### 8
At that [[H1931]] time [[H6256]] we took [[H3947]] from [[H3027]] the two [[H8147]] kings [[H4428]] of the Amorites [[H567]] the land [[H776]] across [[H5676]] the Jordan, [[H3383]] from the Arnon [[H769]] Valley [[H5158]] as [[H5704]] far as Mount [[H2022]] Hermon— [[H2768]]

### 9
which the Sidonians [[H6722]] call [[H7121]] Sirion [[H8303]] but the Amorites [[H567]] call [[H7121]] Senir— [[H8149]]

### 10
all [[H3605]] the cities [[H5892]] of the plateau, [[H4334]] [all] Gilead, [[H1568]] and all [[H3605]] Bashan [[H1316]] as far as [[H5704]] the cities [[H5892]] of Salecah [[H5548]] and Edrei [[H154]] in the kingdom [[H4467]] of Og. [[H5747]]

### 11
(For [[H3588]] only [[H7535]] Og [[H5747]] king [[H4428]] of Bashan [[H1316]] had remained [[H7604]] of the remnant [[H3499]] of the Rephaim. [[H7497]] His bed [[H6210]] of iron, [[H1270]] nine [[H8672]] cubits [[H520]] long [[H753]] and four [[H702]] cubits [[H520]] wide, [[H7341]] [is still] [[H3808]] in Rabbah [[H7237]] of the Ammonites.) [[H1121]]

### 12
So [[H853]] at that [[H1931]] time [[H6256]] we took possession of [[H3423]] this [[H2063]] land. [[H776]] To the Reubenites [[H7206]] and Gadites [[H1425]] I gave [[H5414]] [the land] beyond Aroer [[H6177]] along [[H5921]] the Arnon [[H769]] Valley, [[H5158]] and half [[H2677]] the hill country [[H2022]] of Gilead, [[H1568]] along with its cities. [[H5892]]

### 13
To the half-tribe [[H2677]] of Manasseh [[H4519]] I gave [[H5414]] the rest [[H3499]] of Gilead [[H1568]] and all [[H3605]] of Bashan, [[H1316]] the kingdom [[H4467]] of Og. [[H5747]] (The entire [[H3605]] region [[H2256]] of Argob, [[H709]] the whole [[H3605]] territory of Bashan, [[H1316]] used to be called [[H7121]] the land [[H776]] of the Rephaim.) [[H7497]]

### 14
Jair, [[H2971]] a descendant [[H1121]] of Manasseh, [[H4519]] took [[H3947]] the whole [[H3605]] region [[H2256]] of Argob [[H709]] as far as [[H5704]] the border [[H1366]] of the Geshurites [[H1651]] and Maacathites. [[H4602]] He named [[H7121]] Bashan [[H1316]] after [[H5921]] himself, [[H8034]] Havvoth-jair, [[H2334]] by which [it is called] [[H2088]] to this day. [[H3117]]

### 15
To Machir [[H4353]] I gave [[H5414]] Gilead, [[H1568]]

### 16
and to the Reubenites [[H7206]] and Gadites [[H1425]] I gave [[H5414]] the territory from [[H4480]] Gilead [[H1568]] to [[H5704]] the Arnon [[H769]] Valley [[H5158]] (the middle [[H8432]] of the valley [[H5158]] was the border) [[H1366]] and up to [[H5704]] the Jabbok [[H2999]] River, [[H5158]] the border [[H1366]] of the Ammonites. [[H1121]]

### 17
The Jordan [River] [[H3383]] in the Arabah [[H6160]] bordered it [[H1366]] from Chinnereth [[H3672]] to [[H5704]] the Sea [[H3220]] of the Arabah [[H6160]] (the Salt Sea [[H3220]] ) [[H4417]] with [[H8478]] the slopes [[H794]] of Pisgah [[H6449]] to the east. [[H4217]]

### 18
At that [[H1931]] time [[H6256]] I commanded [[H6680]] you: [[H853]] “The LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] has given [[H5414]] you this [[H2063]] land [[H776]] to possess. [[H3423]] All [[H3605]] your warriors [[H1121]] are to cross over, [[H5674]] armed for battle, [[H2502]] ahead of [[H6440]] your brothers, [[H251]] the Israelites. [[H1121]]

### 19
But [[H7535]] your wives, [[H802]] your children, [[H2945]] and your livestock— [[H4735]] I know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] you have a lot of [[H7227]] livestock— [[H4735]] may remain [[H3427]] in the cities [[H5892]] I have given [[H5414]] you, 

### 20
until [[H5704]] the LORD [[H3068]] gives rest [[H5117]] to your brothers [[H251]] as He has to you,  and they [[H1992]] too [[H1571]] have taken possession of [[H3423]] the land [[H776]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] is giving [[H5414]] them, [[H1992]] across [[H5676]] the Jordan. [[H3383]] Then each [[H376]] of you may return [[H7725]] to the possession [[H3425]] I have given [[H5414]] you. 

### 21
And [[H853]] at that [[H1931]] time [[H6256]] I commanded [[H6680]] Joshua: [[H3091]] “Your own eyes [[H5869]] have seen [[H7200]] all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] has done [[H6213]] to these [[H428]] two [[H8147]] kings. [[H4428]] The LORD [[H3068]] will do [[H6213]] the same [[H3651]] to all [[H3605]] the kingdoms [[H4467]] you [[H859]] are about to enter. [[H5674]]

### 22
Do not [[H3808]] be afraid of them, [[H3372]] for [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] Himself [[H1931]] will fight [[H3898]] for you.” 

### 23
At that [[H1931]] time [[H6256]] I also pleaded [[H2603]] with the LORD: [[H3068]]

### 24
“O Lord [[H136]] GOD, [[H3069]] You [[H859]] have begun [[H2490]] to show [[H7200]] Your greatness [[H1433]] and power [[H3027]] to Your servant. [[H5650]] For [[H834]] what [[H4310]] god [[H410]] in heaven [[H8064]] or on earth [[H776]] can perform [[H6213]] such works [[H4639]] and mighty acts [as Yours]? [[H1369]]

### 25
Please [[H4994]] let me cross over [[H5674]] and see [[H7200]] the beautiful [[H2896]] land [[H776]] beyond [[H5676]] the Jordan— [[H3383]] that [[H2088]] wonderful [[H2896]] hill country [[H2022]] and Lebanon!” [[H3844]]

### 26
But the LORD [[H3068]] was angry [[H5674]] with me on account of you, [[H4616]] and He would not [[H3808]] listen [[H8085]] to me. [[H413]] “That is enough,” [[H7227]] the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H559]] to me. [[H413]] “Do not [[H408]] speak [[H1696]] to [[H413]] Me [[H3254]] again [[H5750]] about this [[H2088]] matter. [[H1697]]

### 27
Go [[H5927]] to the top [[H7218]] of Pisgah [[H6449]] and look [[H5375]] to the west [[H3220]] and north [[H6828]] and south [[H8486]] and east. [[H4217]] See [the land] [[H7200]] with your own eyes, [[H5869]] for [[H3588]] you will not [[H3808]] cross [[H5674]] this [[H2088]] Jordan. [[H3383]]

### 28
But commission [[H6680]] Joshua, [[H3091]] and encourage [[H2388]] and strengthen him, [[H553]] for [[H3588]] he [[H1931]] will cross over [[H5674]] ahead of [[H6440]] the [[H2088]] people [[H5971]] and enable them to inherit [[H5157]] the land [[H776]] that [[H834]] you will see.” [[H7200]]

### 29
So we stayed [[H3427]] in the valley [[H1516]] opposite [[H4136]] Beth-peor. [[H1047]]
