### 1
These [[H428]] are the words [[H1697]] that [[H834]] Moses [[H4872]] spoke [[H1696]] to [[H413]] all [[H3605]] Israel [[H3478]] in the wilderness [[H4057]] east of [[H5676]] the Jordan, [[H3383]] in the Arabah, [[H6160]] opposite [[H4136]] Suph, [[H5489]] between [[H996]] Paran [[H6290]] and Tophel, [[H8603]] Laban, [[H3837]] Hazeroth, [[H2698]] and Di-zahab. [[H1774]]

### 2
It is an eleven-day [[H259]] [journey] from Horeb [[H2722]] to [[H5704]] Kadesh-barnea [[H6947]] by way [[H1870]] of Mount [[H2022]] Seir. [[H8165]]

### 3
In the fortieth [[H705]] year, [[H8141]] on the first day [[H259]] of the eleventh [[H6249]] month, [[H2320]] Moses [[H4872]] proclaimed [[H1696]] to [[H413]] the Israelites [[H1121]] everything [[H3605]] that [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] had commanded [[H6680]] him [[H853]] concerning them. [[H413]]

### 4
This was after [[H310]] he had defeated [[H5221]] Sihon [[H5511]] king [[H4428]] of the Amorites, [[H567]] who [[H834]] lived [[H3427]] in Heshbon, [[H2809]] and then [[H853]] at Edrei [had defeated] [[H154]] Og [[H5747]] king [[H4428]] of Bashan, [[H1316]] who [[H834]] lived [[H3427]] in Ashtaroth. [[H6252]]

### 5
On the east side [[H5676]] of the Jordan [[H3383]] in the land [[H776]] of Moab, [[H4124]] Moses [[H4872]] began [[H2974]] to explain [[H874]] this [[H2063]] law, [[H8451]] saying: [[H559]]

### 6
“The LORD [[H3068]] our God [[H430]] said [[H1696]] to us [[H413]] at Horeb: [[H2722]] You have stayed [[H3427]] at this [[H2088]] mountain [[H2022]] long enough. [[H7227]]

### 7
Resume [[H6437]] your journey [[H5265]] and go [[H935]] to the hill country [[H2022]] of the Amorites; [[H567]] [go] to [[H413]] all [[H3605]] the neighboring peoples [[H7934]] in the Arabah, [[H6160]] in the hill country, [[H2022]] in the foothills, [[H8219]] in the Negev, [[H5045]] and along the seacoast [[H3220]] to the land [[H776]] of the Canaanites [[H3669]] and to Lebanon, [[H3844]] as far as [[H5704]] the great [[H1419]] River [[H5104]] Euphrates. [[H6578]]

### 8
See, [[H7200]] I have placed [[H5414]] the land [[H776]] before you. [[H6440]] Enter [[H935]] and possess [[H3423]] the land [[H776]] that [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] swore [[H7650]] He would give [[H5414]] to your fathers [[H1]] Abraham, [[H85]] Isaac, [[H3327]] and Jacob, [[H3290]] and to their descendants [[H2233]] after them.” [[H310]]

### 9
At that [[H1931]] time [[H6256]] I said [[H559]] to you, [[H413]] “I cannot [[H3808]] carry the burden [[H5375]] for you [[H853]] alone. [[H905]]

### 10
The LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] has multiplied [[H7235]] you, [[H853]] so that today [[H3117]] you are [[H2009]] as numerous [[H7230]] as the stars [[H3556]] in the sky. [[H8064]]

### 11
May the LORD, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of your fathers, [[H1]] increase you [[H3254]] a thousand [[H505]] times over [[H6471]] and bless [[H1288]] you [[H853]] as [[H834]] He has promised. [[H1696]]

### 12
But how [[H349]] can I bear [[H5375]] your troubles, [[H2960]] burdens, [[H4853]] and disputes [[H7379]] all by myself? [[H905]]

### 13
Choose [[H3051]] for yourselves wise, [[H2450]] understanding, [[H995]] and respected men [[H3045]] from each of your tribes, [[H7626]] and I will appoint them [[H7760]] as your leaders.” [[H7218]]

### 14
And you answered [[H6030]] me [[H853]] and said, [[H559]] “What [[H834]] you propose [[H1696]] to do [[H6213]] is good.” [[H2896]]

### 15
So I took [[H3947]] the leaders [[H7218]] of your tribes, [[H7626]] wise [[H2450]] and respected [[H3045]] men, [[H376]] and appointed [[H5414]] them [[H853]] as leaders [[H7218]] over you— [[H5921]] as commanders [[H8269]] of thousands, [[H505]] of hundreds, [[H3967]] of fifties, [[H2572]] and of tens, [[H6235]] and as officers [[H7860]] for your tribes. [[H7626]]

### 16
At that [[H1931]] time [[H6256]] I charged [[H6680]] your judges: [[H8199]] “Hear [[H8085]] the disputes between [[H996]] your brothers, [[H251]] and judge [[H8199]] fairly [[H6664]] between [[H996]] a man [[H376]] and his brother [[H251]] or a foreign resident. [[H1616]]

### 17
Show no partiality [[H5234]] in judging; [[H4941]] hear [[H8085]] [both] small [[H6996]] and great alike. [[H1419]] Do not [[H3808]] be intimidated [[H1481]] by [[H4480]] anyone, [[H376]] for [[H3588]] judgment [[H4941]] belongs to God. [[H430]] And bring [[H7126]] to me [[H413]] any case [[H1697]] too difficult for you, [[H7185]] and I will hear it.” [[H8085]]

### 18
And at that [[H1931]] time [[H6256]] I commanded [[H6680]] you [[H853]] all [[H3605]] the things [[H1697]] you were to do. [[H6213]]

### 19
And just as [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] our God [[H430]] had commanded us, [[H6680]] we set out [[H5265]] from Horeb [[H2722]] and went [[H1980]] toward [[H1870]] the hill country [[H2022]] of the Amorites, [[H567]] through all [[H3605]] the vast [[H1419]] and terrifying [[H3372]] wilderness [[H4057]] you have seen. [[H7200]] When we reached [[H935]] Kadesh-barnea, [[H6947]]

### 20
I said: [[H559]] “You have reached [[H935]] the hill country [[H2022]] of the Amorites, [[H567]] which [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] our God [[H430]] is giving us. [[H5414]]

### 21
See, [[H7200]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] has placed [[H5414]] the land [[H776]] before you. [[H6440]] Go up [[H5927]] and take possession of [[H3423]] it as [[H834]] the LORD, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of your fathers, [[H1]] has told you. [[H1696]] Do not [[H408]] be afraid [[H3372]] or discouraged.” [[H2865]]

### 22
Then all of you [[H3605]] approached [[H7126]] me and said, [[H559]] “Let us send [[H7971]] men [[H376]] ahead of us [[H6440]] to search out [[H2658]] the land [[H776]] and bring us [[H7725]] word [[H1697]] of what route [[H1870]] to follow [[H5927]] and which cities [[H5892]] to enter.” [[H935]]

### 23
The plan [[H1697]] seemed [[H5869]] good to me, [[H3190]] so I selected [[H3947]] twelve [[H8147]] men [[H376]] from among you, [[H4480]] one [[H259]] from each tribe. [[H7626]]

### 24
They left [[H6437]] and went up [[H5927]] into the hill country, [[H2022]] and came [[H935]] to [[H5704]] the Valley [[H5158]] of Eshcol [[H812]] and spied out [the land]. [[H7270]]

### 25
They took [[H3947]] some of the fruit [[H6529]] of the land [[H776]] in their hands, [[H3027]] carried it down [[H3381]] to us, [[H413]] and brought us [[H7725]] word: [[H1697]] “It is a good [[H2896]] land [[H776]] that [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] our God [[H430]] is giving [[H5414]] us.” 

### 26
But you were unwilling [[H3808]] to go up; [[H5927]] you rebelled [[H4784]] against the command [[H6310]] of the LORD [[H3068]] your God. [[H430]]

### 27
You grumbled [[H7279]] in your tents [[H168]] and said, [[H559]] “Because the LORD [[H3068]] hates us, [[H853]] He has brought us out [[H3318]] of the land [[H776]] of Egypt [[H4714]] to deliver [[H5414]] us [[H853]] into the hand [[H3027]] of the Amorites [[H567]] to be annihilated. [[H8045]]

### 28
Where [[H575]] can we [[H587]] go? [[H5927]] Our brothers [[H251]] have made our hearts melt, [[H4549]] saying: [[H559]] ‘The people [[H5971]] are larger [[H1419]] and taller [[H7311]] than we are; [[H4480]] the cities [[H5892]] are large, [[H1419]] with walls up [[H1219]] to the heavens. [[H8064]] We even [[H1571]] saw [[H7200]] the descendants [[H1121]] of the Anakim [[H6062]] there.’” [[H8033]]

### 29
So I said [[H559]] to you: [[H413]] “Do not [[H3808]] be terrified [[H6206]] or afraid [[H3372]] of them! [[H1992]]

### 30
The LORD [[H3068]] your God, [[H430]] who goes [[H1980]] before you, [[H6440]] will fight for you, [[H3898]] just as [[H3605]] you saw [[H5869]] Him do [[H6213]] for you [[H854]] in Egypt [[H4714]]

### 31
[and] [[H7200]] in the wilderness, [[H4057]] where [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] carried you, [[H5375]] as [[H834]] a man [[H376]] carries [[H5375]] his son, [[H1121]] all [[H3605]] the way [[H1870]] by which [[H834]] you traveled [[H1980]] until [[H5704]] you reached [[H935]] this [[H2088]] place.” [[H4725]]

### 32
But in spite [[H1697]] of all this, [[H2088]] you did not [[H369]] trust [[H539]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God, [[H430]]

### 33
who went [[H1980]] before you [[H6440]] on the journey, [[H1870]] in the fire [[H784]] by night [[H3915]] and in the cloud [[H6051]] by day, [[H3119]] to seek out [[H8446]] a place [[H4725]] for you to camp [[H2583]] [and] to show you [[H7200]] the road [[H1870]] to travel. [[H1980]]

### 34
When the LORD [[H3068]] heard [[H8085]] your words, [[H1697]] He grew angry [[H7107]] and swore an oath, [[H7650]] saying, [[H559]]

### 35
“Not [[H518]] one [[H376]] of the [[H428]] men [[H376]] of this [[H2088]] evil [[H7451]] generation [[H1755]] shall see [[H7200]] the good [[H2896]] land [[H776]] I swore [[H7650]] to give [[H5414]] your fathers, [[H1]]

### 36
except [[H2108]] Caleb [[H3612]] the son [[H1121]] of Jephunneh. [[H3312]] He [[H1931]] will see it, [[H7200]] and I will give [[H5414]] him [[H853]] and his descendants [[H1121]] the land [[H776]] on which [[H834]] he has set foot, [[H1869]] because [[H3282]] he followed [[H310]] the LORD [[H3068]] wholeheartedly.” [[H4390]]

### 37
The LORD [[H3068]] was also angry [[H599]] with me  on your account, [[H1558]] and He said, [[H559]] “Not [[H3808]] even [[H1571]] you [[H859]] shall enter [[H935]] [the land]. [[H8033]]

### 38
Joshua [[H3091]] son [[H1121]] of Nun, [[H5126]] who stands [[H5975]] before you, [[H6440]] will enter [[H935]] it. [[H8033]] Encourage him, [[H2388]] for [[H3588]] he [[H1931]] will enable Israel [[H3478]] to inherit [[H5157]] [the land]. [[H853]]

### 39
And the little ones, [[H2945]] whom [[H834]] you said [[H559]] would become [[H1961]] captives— [[H957]] your children [[H1121]] who [[H834]] do not [[H3808]] know [[H3045]] good [[H2896]] from evil, [[H7451]] will enter [[H935]] [the land] [[H8033]] I give them [[H5414]] and [[H1992]] possess it. [[H3423]]

### 40
But you [[H859]] are to turn back [[H6437]] and head [[H5265]] for the wilderness [[H4057]] along the route [[H1870]] to the Red [[H5488]] Sea.” [[H3220]]

### 41
“We have sinned [[H2398]] against the LORD,” [[H3068]] you replied. [[H6030]] “We [[H587]] will go up [[H5927]] and fight, [[H3898]] as [[H3605]] the LORD [[H3068]] our God [[H430]] has commanded us.” [[H6680]] Then each [[H376]] of you put on [[H2296]] his weapons [[H3627]] of war, [[H4421]] thinking it easy [[H1951]] to go up [[H5927]] into the hill country. [[H2022]]

### 42
But the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H559]] to me, [[H413]] “Tell [[H559]] them  not [[H3808]] to go up [[H5927]] and fight, [[H3898]] for [[H3588]] I am not [[H369]] with [[H7130]] you [[H3808]] to keep you from [[H3808]] defeat [[H5062]] by [[H6440]] your enemies.” [[H341]]

### 43
So I spoke [[H1696]] to you, [[H413]] but you would not [[H3808]] listen. [[H8085]] You rebelled against [[H4784]] the command [[H6310]] of the LORD [[H3068]] and presumptuously [[H2102]] went up [[H5927]] into the hill country. [[H2022]]

### 44
Then the Amorites [[H567]] who lived [[H3427]] in [[H1931]] the hills [[H2022]] came out [[H3318]] against you [[H7125]] and chased [[H7291]] you like [[H834]] a swarm of bees. [[H1682]] They routed [[H3807]] you from Seir [[H8165]] all the way [[H5704]] to Hormah. [[H2767]]

### 45
And you returned [[H7725]] and wept [[H1058]] before [[H6440]] the LORD, [[H3068]] but [He] [[H3068]] would not [[H3808]] listen [[H8085]] to your voice [[H6963]] [or] [[H3808]] give ear [[H238]] to you. [[H413]]

### 46
For this reason you stayed [[H3427]] in Kadesh [[H6946]] for a long time— [[H7227]] a very long time. [[H3117]]
