###### 1
You [[H859]] are sons [[H1121]] of the LORD [[H3068]] your God; [[H430]] do not [[H3808]] cut [[H1413]] yourselves [[H3808]] or shave [[H7760]] your forehead [[H996]] on behalf of the dead, [[H4191]]

###### 2
for [[H3588]] you [[H859]] are a holy [[H6918]] people [[H5971]] belonging to the LORD [[H3068]] your God. [[H430]] The LORD [[H3068]] has chosen [[H977]] you to be [[H1961]] His prized possession [[H5459]] out of all [[H3605]] the peoples [[H5971]] on [[H5921]] the face [[H6440]] of the earth. [[H127]]

###### 3
You must not [[H3808]] eat [[H398]] any [[H3605]] detestable thing. [[H8441]]

###### 4
These [[H2063]] are the animals [[H929]] that [[H834]] you may eat: [[H398]] The ox, [[H7794]] the sheep, [[H3775]] the goat, [[H5795]]

###### 7
But [[H389]] of those that chew [[H5927]] the cud [[H1625]] or have divided [[H8156]] hooves, [[H6541]] you are not [[H3808]] to eat [[H398]] the camel, [[H1581]] the rabbit, [[H768]] [or] [[H853]] the rock badger. [[H8227]] Although [[H3588]] they [[H1992]] chew [[H5927]] the cud, [[H1625]] they do not [[H3808]] have hooves. [[H6541]] They [[H1992]] are unclean for you, [[H2931]]

###### 8
as well as [[H853]] the pig; [[H2386]] though its [[H1931]] hooves [[H6541]] are divided, [[H6536]] it does not [[H3808]] chew the cud. [[H1625]] It [[H1931]] is unclean for you. [[H2931]] You must not [[H3808]] eat [[H398]] its meat [[H1320]] or touch [[H5060]] its carcass. [[H5038]]

###### 9
Of all [[H3605]] [the creatures] [[H834]] in the water, [[H4325]] you may eat [[H398]] anything [[H3605]] with fins [[H5579]] and scales, [[H7193]]

###### 10
but you may not [[H3808]] eat [[H398]] anything [[H3605]] that [[H834]] does not [[H369]] have fins [[H5579]] and scales; [[H7193]] it [[H1931]] is unclean [[H2931]] for you. 

###### 11
You may eat [[H398]] any [[H3605]] clean [[H2889]] bird, [[H6833]]

###### 12
but these [[H2088]] you may not [[H3808]] eat: [[H398]] the eagle, [[H5404]] the vulture, [[H6538]] the black vulture, [[H5822]]

###### 13
the red kite, [[H7201]] the black kite, [[H344]] any kind [[H4327]] of falcon, [[H1772]]

any [[H3605]] kind [[H4327]] of raven, [[H6158]]

###### 18
the stork, [[H2624]] any kind [[H4327]] of heron, [[H601]] the hoopoe, [[H1744]] or the bat. [[H5847]]

###### 19
All [[H3605]] winged insects [[H5775]] that swarm [[H8318]] are unclean for you; [[H2931]] they may not [[H3808]] be eaten. [[H398]]

###### 20
But you may eat [[H398]] any [[H3605]] clean [[H2889]] bird. [[H5775]]

###### 21
You are not [[H3808]] to eat [[H398]] any [[H3605]] carcass; [[H5038]] you may give [[H5414]] it to a temporary resident [[H1616]] within your gates, [[H8179]] and he may eat it, [[H398]] or [[H176]] you may sell [[H4376]] it to a foreigner. [[H5237]] For [[H3588]] you [[H859]] are a holy [[H6918]] people [[H5971]] belonging to the LORD [[H3068]] your God. [[H430]] You must not [[H3808]] cook [[H1310]] a young goat [[H1423]] in its mothers [[H517]] milk. [[H2461]]

###### 22
You must be sure to set aside a tenth [[H6237]] of all [[H3605]] the produce [[H8393]] brought forth [[H3318]] each year [[H8141]] from your fields. [[H7704]]

###### 23
And you are to eat [[H398]] a tenth [[H4643]] of your grain, [[H1715]] new wine, [[H8492]] and oil, [[H3323]] and the firstborn [[H1062]] of your herds [[H1241]] and flocks, [[H6629]] in the presence [[H6440]] of the LORD [[H3069]] your God [[H430]] at the place [[H4725]] where [[H834]] He will choose [[H977]] as a dwelling [[H7931]] for His Name, [[H8034]] so that [[H4616]] you may learn [[H3925]] to fear [[H3372]] the LORD [[H3069]] your God [[H430]] always. [[H3605]]

###### 24
But if [[H3588]] the distance [[H1870]] is too great [[H7235]] for [[H4480]] you to carry [[H5375]] that with which [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] has blessed you, [[H1288]] because [[H3588]] the place [[H4725]] where [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] will choose [[H977]] to put [[H7760]] His Name [[H8034]] is too far away, [[H7368]]

###### 25
then exchange [[H5414]] it for money, [[H3701]] take [[H6887]] the money [[H3701]] in your hand, [[H3027]] and go [[H1980]] to [[H413]] the place [[H4725]] where [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] will choose. [[H977]]

###### 26
Then you may spend [[H5414]] the money [[H3701]] on anything [[H3605]] you [[H5315]] desire: [[H183]] cattle, [[H1241]] sheep, [[H6629]] wine, [[H3196]] strong drink, [[H7941]] or anything [[H3605]] you [[H5315]] wish. [[H7592]] You are to feast [[H398]] there [[H8033]] in the presence [[H6440]] of the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] and rejoice [[H8055]] with your household. [[H1004]]

###### 27
And do not [[H3808]] neglect [[H5800]] the Levite [[H3881]] within your gates, [[H8179]] since [[H3588]] he has no [[H369]] portion [[H2506]] or inheritance [[H5159]] among you. [[H5973]]

###### 28
At the end [[H7097]] of every three [[H7969]] years, [[H8141]] bring [[H3318]] a tenth [[H4643]] of all [[H3605]] your produce [[H8393]] for that [[H1931]] year [[H8141]] and lay [it] up [[H3240]] within your gates. [[H8179]]

###### 29
Then the Levite [[H3881]] (because [[H3588]] he has no [[H369]] portion [[H2506]] or inheritance [[H5159]] among you), [[H5973]] the foreigner, [[H1616]] the fatherless, [[H3490]] and the widow [[H490]] within your gates [[H8179]] may come [[H935]] and eat [[H398]] and be satisfied. [[H7646]] And the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] will bless [[H1288]] you in all [[H3605]] the work [[H4639]] of your hands. [[H3027]]
