[[Deuteronomy 7|←]] • [[Deuteronomy 9|→]]

---

###### 1
You must carefully [[H8104]] follow [[H6213]] every [[H3605]] command [[H4687]] I [[H595]] am giving you today, [[H6680]] so that [[H4616]] you may live [[H2421]] and multiply, [[H7235]] and enter [[H935]] and possess [[H3423]] the land [[H776]] the LORD [[H3068]] swore [[H7650]] to your fathers. [[H1]]

###### 2
Remember that [[H2142]] these [[H2088]] forty [[H705]] years [[H8141]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] led you [[H1980]] all [[H3605]] the way [[H1870]] in the wilderness, [[H4057]] so that [[H4616]] He might humble you [[H6031]] and test you [[H5254]] in order to know [[H3045]] what [[H834]] was in your heart, [[H3824]] whether or [[H518]] not [[H3808]] you would keep [[H8104]] His commandments. [[H4687]]

###### 3
He humbled you, [[H6031]] and in your hunger [[H7456]] gave you manna [[H4478]] to eat, [[H398]] which [[H834]] neither [[H3808]] you [nor] your fathers [[H1]] had known, [[H3045]] so that [[H4616]] you might understand [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] man [[H120]] does not [[H3808]] live [[H2421]] on [[H5921]] bread [[H3899]] alone, [[H905]] but [[H3588]] on [[H5921]] every [[H3605]] word that comes from [[H4161]] the mouth [[H6310]] of the LORD. [[H3068]]

###### 4
Your clothing [[H8071]] did not [[H3808]] wear out [[H1086]] and your feet [[H7272]] did not [[H3808]] swell [[H1216]] during these [[H2088]] forty [[H705]] years. [[H8141]]

###### 5
So know [[H3045]] in [[H5973]] your heart [[H3824]] that [[H3588]] just as [[H834]] a man [[H376]] disciplines [[H3256]] his son, [[H1121]] [so] the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] disciplines you. [[H3256]]

###### 6
Therefore you shall keep [[H8104]] the commandments [[H4687]] of the LORD [[H3069]] your God, [[H430]] walking [[H1980]] in His ways [[H1870]] and fearing [[H3372]] Him. [[H853]]

###### 7
For [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] is bringing [[H935]] you into [[H413]] a good [[H2896]] land, [[H776]] a land [[H776]] of brooks [[H5158]] and fountains [[H5869]] and springs [[H8415]] that flow [[H3318]] through the valleys [[H1237]] and hills; [[H2022]]

###### 8
a land [[H776]] of wheat, [[H2406]] barley, [[H8184]] vines, [[H1612]] fig trees, [[H8384]] and pomegranates; [[H7416]] a land [[H776]] of olive [[H2132]] oil [[H8081]] and honey; [[H1706]]

###### 9
a land [[H776]] where [[H834]] you will eat [[H398]] food [[H3899]] without [[H3808]] scarcity, [[H4544]] where you will lack [[H2637]] nothing; [[H3808]] a land [[H776]] whose rocks [[H68]] are iron [[H1270]] and whose hills [[H2042]] can be mined [[H2672]] for copper. [[H5178]]

###### 10
When you eat [[H398]] and are satisfied, [[H7646]] you are to bless [[H1288]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] for [[H5921]] the good [[H2896]] land [[H776]] He has given you. [[H5414]]

###### 11
Be careful [[H8104]] not [[H6435]] to forget [[H7911]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] by failing [[H1115]] to keep [[H8104]] His commandments [[H4687]] and ordinances [[H4941]] and statutes, [[H2708]] which [[H834]] I [[H595]] am giving you [[H6680]] this day. [[H3117]]

###### 12
Otherwise, [[H6435]] when you eat [[H398]] and are satisfied, [[H7646]] when you build [[H1129]] fine [[H2896]] houses [[H1004]] in which to dwell, [[H3427]]

###### 13
and when your herds [[H1241]] and flocks [[H6629]] grow large, [[H7235]] and your silver [[H3701]] and gold [[H2091]] are multiplied, [[H7235]] and all [[H3605]] you have [[H834]] increases, [[H7235]]

###### 14
then your heart [[H3824]] will become proud, [[H7311]] and you will forget [[H7911]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] who brought you out [[H3318]] of the land [[H776]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] out of the house [[H1004]] of slavery. [[H5650]]

###### 15
He led [[H1980]] you through the vast [[H1419]] and terrifying [[H3372]] wilderness [[H4057]] with its venomous [[H8314]] snakes [[H5175]] and scorpions, [[H6137]] a thirsty [[H6774]] and waterless [land]. [[H4325]] He brought you [[H3318]] water [[H4325]] from the rock [[H6697]] of flint. [[H2496]]

###### 16
He fed you [[H398]] in the wilderness [[H4057]] with manna [[H4478]] that [[H834]] your fathers [[H1]] had not [[H3808]] known, [[H3045]] in order to [[H4616]] humble you [[H6031]] and test you, [[H5254]] so that in the end [[H319]] He might cause you to prosper. [[H3190]]

###### 17
You may say [[H559]] in your heart, [[H3824]] “The power [[H3581]] and the strength [[H6108]] of my hand [[H3027]] has made [[H6213]] this [[H2088]] wealth for me.” [[H2428]]

###### 18
But remember [[H2142]] that it is the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] [who] [[H1931]] gives [[H5414]] you the power [[H3581]] to gain [[H6213]] wealth, [[H2428]] in order to [[H4616]] confirm [[H6965]] His covenant [[H1285]] that [[H834]] He swore [[H7650]] to your fathers, [[H1]] as it is this day. [[H3117]]

###### 19
If [[H518]] you ever forget [[H7911]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] and go [[H1980]] after [[H310]] other [[H312]] gods [[H430]] to worship [[H5647]] and bow down to them, [[H7812]] I testify [[H5749]] against you today [[H3117]] that [[H3588]] you will surely [[H6]] perish. [[H6]]

###### 20
Like the nations [[H1471]] the LORD [[H3068]] has destroyed [[H6]] before you, [[H6440]] so [[H3651]] you will perish [[H6]] if you do not [[H3808]] obey [[H8085]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God. [[H430]]
