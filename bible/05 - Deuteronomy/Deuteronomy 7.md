[[Deuteronomy 6|←]] • [[Deuteronomy 8|→]]

### 1
When [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] brings [[H935]] you into [[H413]] the land [[H776]] you [[H859]] are entering [[H935]] to possess, [[H3423]] and He drives out [[H5394]] before [[H4480]] you [[H6440]] many [[H7227]] nations— [[H1471]] the Hittites, [[H2850]] Girgashites, [[H1622]] Amorites, [[H567]] Canaanites, [[H3669]] Perizzites, [[H6522]] Hivites [[H2340]] and Jebusites, [[H2983]] seven [[H7651]] nations [[H1471]] larger [[H7227]] and stronger [than you]— [[H6099]]

### 2
and when the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] has delivered them over [[H5414]] to you [[H6440]] to defeat them, [[H5221]] then you must completely destroy them. [[H2763]] Make [[H3772]] no [[H3808]] treaty [[H1285]] with them  and show them no [[H3808]] mercy. [[H2603]]

### 3
Do not [[H3808]] intermarry with them. [[H2859]] Do not [[H3808]] give [[H5414]] your daughters [[H1323]] to their sons [[H1121]] or take [[H3947]] their daughters [[H1323]] for your sons, [[H1121]]

### 4
because [[H3588]] they will turn your sons [[H1121]] away [[H5493]] from following Me [[H310]] to serve [[H5647]] other [[H312]] gods. [[H430]] Then the anger [[H639]] of the LORD [[H3068]] will burn against you, [[H2734]] and He will swiftly [[H4118]] destroy you. [[H8045]]

### 5
Instead, [[H3588]] this is what [[H3541]] you are to do to them: [[H6213]] tear down [[H5422]] their altars, [[H4196]] smash [[H7665]] their sacred pillars, [[H4676]] cut down [[H1438]] their Asherah poles, [[H842]] and burn [[H8313]] their idols [[H6456]] in the fire. [[H784]]

### 6
For [[H3588]] you [[H859]] are a people [[H5971]] holy [[H6918]] unto the LORD [[H3068]] your God. [[H430]] The LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] has chosen [[H977]] you to be [[H1961]] as a people [[H5971]] for His prized possession, [[H5459]] above all [[H3605]] peoples [[H5971]] on [[H5921]] the face [[H6440]] of the earth. [[H127]]

### 7
The LORD [[H3068]] did not [[H3808]] set His affection on you [[H2836]] [and] choose you [[H977]] because you were more numerous [[H7230]] than the other [[H3605]] peoples, [[H5971]] for [[H3588]] you [[H859]] were the fewest [[H4592]] of all [[H3605]] peoples. [[H5971]]

### 8
But [[H3588]] because the LORD [[H3068]] loved [[H160]] you [[H853]] and kept [[H8104]] the oath [[H7621]] He swore [[H7650]] to your fathers, [[H1]] He [[H3068]] brought you out [[H3318]] with a mighty [[H2389]] hand [[H3027]] and redeemed you [[H6299]] from the house [[H1004]] of slavery, [[H5650]] from the hand [[H3027]] of Pharaoh [[H6547]] king [[H4428]] of Egypt. [[H4714]]

### 9
Know therefore [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] is God, [[H430]] the faithful [[H539]] God [[H410]] who keeps [[H8104]] His covenant [[H1285]] with loving devotion [[H2617]] for a thousand [[H505]] generations [[H1755]] of those who love Him [[H157]] and keep [[H8104]] His commandments. [[H4687]]

### 10
But those who hate Him [[H8130]] He repays [[H7999]] to [[H413]] their faces [[H6440]] with destruction; [[H6]] He will not [[H3808]] hesitate [[H309]] to repay [[H7999]] to [[H413]] his face [[H6440]] the one who hates Him. [[H8130]]

### 11
So keep [[H8104]] the commandments [[H4687]] and [[H853]] statutes [[H2706]] and [[H853]] ordinances [[H4941]] that [[H834]] I [[H595]] am giving you [[H6680]] to follow [[H6213]] this day. [[H3117]]

### 12
If [[H6118]] you listen to [[H8085]] these [[H428]] ordinances [[H4941]] and keep them carefully, [[H8104]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] will keep [[H8104]] His covenant [[H1285]] with loving devotion, [[H2617]] as He swore [[H7650]] to your fathers. [[H1]]

### 13
He will love you [[H157]] and bless you [[H1288]] and multiply you. [[H7235]] He will bless [[H1288]] the fruit [[H6529]] of your womb [[H990]] and the produce [[H6529]] of your land— [[H127]] your grain, [[H1715]] new wine, [[H8492]] and oil— [[H3323]] the young of your herds, [[H504]] and the newborn [[H6251]] of your flocks, [[H6629]] in [[H5921]] the land [[H127]] that [[H834]] He swore [[H7650]] to your fathers [[H1]] to give you. [[H5414]]

### 14
You will be [[H1961]] blessed [[H1288]] above all [[H3605]] peoples; [[H5971]] among you  there will be [[H1961]] no [[H3808]] barren man [[H6135]] or woman [[H6135]] or livestock. [[H929]]

### 15
And the LORD [[H3068]] will remove [[H5493]] from you [[H4480]] all [[H3605]] sickness. [[H2483]] He will not [[H3808]] lay [[H7760]] upon you  any [[H3605]] of the terrible [[H7451]] diseases [[H4064]] you knew [[H3045]] in Egypt, [[H4714]] but He will inflict them [[H5414]] on all [[H3605]] who hate you. [[H8130]]

### 16
You must destroy [[H398]] all [[H3605]] the peoples [[H5971]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] will deliver [[H5414]] to you.  Do not [[H3808]] look on them [[H5869]] with pity. [[H2347]] Do not [[H3808]] worship [[H5647]] their gods, [[H430]] for [[H3588]] that [[H1931]] will be a snare [[H4170]] to  you. 

### 17
You may say [[H559]] in your heart, [[H3824]] “These [[H428]] nations [[H1471]] are greater [[H7227]] than we are; [[H4480]] how [[H349]] can [[H3201]] we drive them out?” [[H3423]]

### 18
But do not [[H3808]] be afraid [[H3372]] of them. [[H1992]] Be sure to remember [[H2142]] what [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] did [[H6213]] to Pharaoh [[H6547]] and all [[H3605]] Egypt: [[H4714]]

### 19
the great [[H1419]] trials [[H4531]] that [[H834]] you [[H5869]] saw, [[H7200]] the signs [[H226]] and wonders, [[H4159]] and the mighty [[H2389]] hand [[H3027]] and outstretched [[H5186]] arm [[H2220]] by which [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] brought you out. [[H3318]] The LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] will do [[H6213]] the same [[H3651]] to all [[H3605]] the peoples [[H5971]] you [[H859]] now fear. [[H3373]]

### 20
Moreover, the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] will [[H1571]] send [[H7971]] the hornet [[H6880]] against them [[H5704]] until all the survivors [[H7604]] and those hiding [[H5641]] from you [[H6440]] have perished. [[H6]]

### 21
Do not [[H3808]] be terrified [[H6206]] by them, [[H6440]] for [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God, [[H430]] who [is] among you, [[H7130]] [is] a great [[H1419]] and awesome [[H3372]] God. [[H410]]

### 22
The LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] will drive out [[H5394]] these [[H411]] nations [[H1471]] before you [[H6440]] little [[H4592]] by little. [[H4592]] You will not [[H3808]] be enabled [[H3201]] to eliminate [[H3615]] them all at once, [[H4118]] or [[H6435]] the wild [[H7704]] animals [[H2416]] would multiply [[H7235]] around you. [[H5921]]

### 23
But the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] will give them over [[H5414]] to you [[H6440]] and throw them [[H2000]] into great [[H1419]] confusion, [[H4103]] until [[H5704]] they are destroyed. [[H8045]]

### 24
He will hand their kings [[H4428]] over to [[H5414]] you, [[H3027]] and you will wipe out [[H6]] their names [[H8034]] from under [[H8478]] heaven. [[H8064]] No [[H3808]] one [[H376]] will be able to stand [[H3320]] against you; [[H6440]] you will annihilate them. [[H8045]]

### 25
You must burn up [[H8313]] the images [[H6456]] of their gods; [[H430]] do not [[H3808]] covet [[H2530]] the silver [[H3701]] and gold [[H2091]] [that is] on them [[H5921]] or take it [[H3947]] for yourselves,  or [[H6435]] you will be ensnared by it; [[H3369]] for [[H3588]] it [[H1931]] is detestable [[H8441]] to the LORD [[H3068]] your God. [[H430]]

### 26
And you must not [[H3808]] bring [[H935]] any detestable thing [[H8441]] into [[H413]] your house, [[H1004]] or you, like it, will be [[H1961]] set apart for destruction. [[H2764]] You are to utterly detest [[H8262]] and abhor it, [[H8581]] because [[H3588]] it [[H1931]] is set apart for destruction. [[H2764]]
