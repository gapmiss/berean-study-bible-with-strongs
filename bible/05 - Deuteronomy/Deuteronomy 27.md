Then Moses [[H4872]] and the elders [[H2205]] of Israel [[H3478]] commanded [[H6680]] the people, [[H5971]] “Keep [[H8104]] all [[H3605]] the commandments [[H4687]] I [[H595]] am giving [[H6680]] you [[H853]] today. [[H3117]]

### 2
And [[H1961]] on the day [[H3117]] you cross [[H5674]] the Jordan [[H3383]] into [[H413]] the land [[H776]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] is giving you, [[H5414]] you are to set up [[H6965]] large [[H1419]] stones [[H68]] and coat [[H7874]] them [[H853]] with plaster. [[H7874]]

### 3
Write [[H3789]] on them [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] the words [[H1697]] of this [[H2063]] law [[H8451]] when you have crossed over [[H5674]] to [[H4616]] enter [[H935]] the land [[H776]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] is giving you, [[H5414]] a land [[H776]] flowing [[H2100]] with milk [[H2461]] and honey, [[H1706]] just as [[H834]] the LORD, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of your fathers, [[H1]] has promised you. [[H1696]]

### 4
And [[H1961]] when you have crossed [[H5674]] the Jordan, [[H3383]] you are to set up [[H6965]] these [[H428]] stones [[H68]] on Mount [[H2022]] Ebal, [[H5858]] as [[H834]] I [[H595]] am commanding you today, [[H6680]] and you are to coat [[H7874]] them [[H853]] with plaster. [[H7874]]

### 5
Moreover, you shall build [[H1129]] there [[H8033]] an altar [[H4196]] to the LORD [[H3068]] your God, [[H430]] an altar of [[H4196]] stones. [[H68]] You must not [[H3808]] use [[H5130]] any iron tool [[H1270]] on them. [[H5921]]

### 6
You shall build [[H1129]] the altar [[H4196]] of the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] with uncut [[H8003]] stones [[H68]] and offer [[H5927]] upon it [[H5921]] burnt offerings [[H5930]] to the LORD [[H3068]] your God. [[H430]]

### 7
There [[H8033]] you are to sacrifice [[H2076]] [your] peace offerings, [[H8002]] eating them [[H398]] and rejoicing [[H8055]] in the presence [[H6440]] of the LORD [[H3068]] your God. [[H430]]

### 8
And you shall write [[H3789]] distinctly [[H874]] upon [[H5921]] these stones [[H68]] all [[H3605]] the words [[H1697]] of this [[H2063]] law.” [[H8451]]

### 9
Then Moses [[H4872]] and the Levitical [[H3881]] priests [[H3548]] spoke [[H1696]] to [[H413]] all [[H3605]] Israel: [[H3478]] “Be silent, [[H5535]] O Israel, [[H3478]] and listen! [[H8085]] This [[H2088]] day [[H3117]] you have become [[H1961]] the people [[H5971]] of the LORD [[H3068]] your God. [[H430]]

### 10
You shall therefore obey [[H8085]] the voice [[H6963]] of the LORD [[H3069]] your God [[H430]] and follow [[H6213]] His commandments [[H4687]] and statutes [[H2706]] I [[H595]] am giving you today.” [[H6680]]
