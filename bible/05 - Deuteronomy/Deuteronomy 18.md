# Deuteronomy 18

[[Deuteronomy 17|←]] • [[Deuteronomy 19|→]]

---

### 1
The Levitical [[H3881]] priests— [[H3548]] indeed the whole [[H3605]] tribe [[H7626]] of Levi— [[H3878]] shall have [[H1961]] no [[H3808]] portion [[H2506]] or inheritance [[H5159]] with [[H5973]] Israel. [[H3478]] They are to eat [[H398]] the offerings made by fire [[H801]] to the LORD; [[H3068]] that is their inheritance. [[H5159]]

### 2
Although they have [[H1961]] no [[H3808]] inheritance [[H5159]] among [[H7130]] their brothers, [[H251]] the LORD [[H3068]] [is] their inheritance, [[H5159]] as [[H834]] He promised [[H1696]] them. 

### 3
This [[H2088]] shall be [[H1961]] the priests’ [[H3548]] share [[H4941]] from the people [[H5971]] who offer [[H2076]] a sacrifice, [[H2077]] whether [[H518]] a bull [[H7794]] or [[H518]] a sheep: [[H7716]] the priests [[H3548]] are to be given [[H5414]] the shoulder, [[H2220]] jowls, [[H3895]] and the stomach. [[H6896]]

### 4
You are to give [[H5414]] them  the firstfruits [[H7225]] of your grain, [[H1715]] new wine, [[H8492]] and oil, [[H3323]] and the first [[H7225]] wool sheared [[H1488]] from your flock. [[H6629]]

### 5
For [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] has chosen [[H977]] [Levi] and his sons [[H1121]] out of all [[H3605]] your tribes [[H7626]] to stand [[H5975]] and minister [[H8334]] in His [[H3068]] name [[H8034]] for all [[H3605]] time. [[H3117]]

### 6
Now if [[H3588]] a Levite [[H3881]] moves [[H935]] from any [[H259]] town [[H8179]] of residence [[H1481]] throughout [[H8033]] Israel [[H3478]] and comes [[H935]] in all [[H3605]] earnestness [[H185]] to [[H413]] the place [[H4725]] the LORD [[H3068]] will choose, [[H977]]

### 7
then he shall serve [[H8334]] in the name [[H8034]] of the LORD [[H3068]] his God [[H430]] like all [[H3605]] his fellow [[H251]] Levites [[H3881]] who stand [[H5975]] there [[H8033]] before [[H6440]] the LORD. [[H3068]]

### 8
They shall eat [[H398]] equal portions, [[H2506]] even though [[H905]] he has received [money] from [[H5921]] the sale [[H4465]] of his father’s estate. [[H1]]

### 9
When [[H3588]] you [[H859]] enter [[H935]] the land [[H776]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] is giving you, [[H5414]] do not [[H3808]] imitate [[H6213]] the detestable ways [[H8441]] of the nations [[H1471]] there. [[H1992]]

### 10
Let no one [[H3808]] be found [[H4672]] among you  who sacrifices [[H5674]] his son [[H1121]] or daughter [[H1323]] in the fire, [[H784]] practices divination [[H7080]] [or] conjury, [[H6049]] interprets omens, [[H5172]] practices sorcery, [[H3784]]

### 11
casts spells, [[H2266]] consults [[H7592]] a medium [[H178]] or familiar spirit, [[H3049]] or inquires [[H1875]] of [[H413]] the dead. [[H4191]]

### 12
For whoever [[H3605]] does [[H6213]] these things [[H428]] is detestable [[H8441]] to the LORD, [[H3068]] and because [[H1558]] of these [[H428]] detestable things [[H8441]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] is driving out [[H3423]] [the nations] before you. [[H6440]]

### 13
You must be [[H1961]] blameless [[H8549]] before [[H5973]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God. [[H430]]

### 14
Though [[H3588]] these [[H428]] nations [[H1471]] you [[H859]] shall dispossess [[H3423]] listen [[H8085]] to [[H413]] conjurers [[H6049]] and diviners, [[H7080]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] has not [[H3808]] permitted you [[H5414]] to do so. [[H3651]]

### 15
The LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] will raise up [[H6965]] for you a prophet [[H5030]] like me [[H3644]] from among [[H7130]] your own brothers. [[H251]] You must listen [[H8085]] to him. [[H413]]

### 16
This is what [[H3605]] you asked [[H7592]] of [[H5973]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] at Horeb [[H2722]] on the day [[H3117]] of the assembly, [[H6951]] when you said, [[H559]] “Let us not [[H3808]] hear [[H8085]] the voice [[H6963]] of the LORD [[H3068]] our God [[H430]] or see [[H7200]] this [[H2063]] great [[H1419]] fire [[H784]] anymore, [[H5750]] so that we will not [[H3808]] die! [[H4191]]

### 17
Then the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H559]] to me, [[H413]] “They have spoken [[H1696]] well. [[H3190]]

### 18
I will raise up [[H6965]] for them a prophet [[H5030]] like you [[H3644]] from among [[H7130]] their brothers. [[H251]] I will put [[H5414]] My words [[H1697]] in his mouth, [[H6310]] and he will tell [[H1696]] them [[H413]] everything [[H3605]] I command him. [[H6680]]

### 19
And I [[H595]] will hold accountable [[H1875]] anyone [[H376]] who [[H834]] does not [[H3808]] listen [[H8085]] to [[H413]] My words [[H1697]] that [[H834]] [that prophet] speaks [[H1696]] in My name. [[H8034]]

### 20
But [[H389]] if any prophet [[H5030]] dares [[H2102]] to speak [[H1696]] a message [[H1697]] in My name [[H8034]] that [[H834]] I have not [[H3808]] commanded [[H6680]] him to speak, [[H1696]] [or] [[H834]] to speak [[H1696]] in the name [[H8034]] of other [[H312]] gods, [[H430]] that [[H1931]] prophet [[H5030]] must be put to death.” [[H4191]]

### 21
You may ask [[H559]] in your heart, [[H3824]] “How [[H349]] can we recognize [[H3045]] a message [[H1697]] that [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] has not [[H3808]] spoken?” [[H1696]]

### 22
When [[H834]] a prophet [[H5030]] speaks [[H1696]] in the name [[H8034]] of the LORD [[H3068]] and the message [[H1697]] does not [[H3808]] come to pass [[H1961]] or come true, [[H935]] that [[H1931]] is a message [[H1697]] the LORD [[H3068]] has not [[H3808]] spoken. [[H1696]] The prophet [[H5030]] has spoken [[H1696]] presumptuously. [[H2087]] Do not [[H3808]] be afraid [[H1481]] of him. [[H4480]]
