### 1
Then we turned back [[H6437]] and headed [[H5265]] for the wilderness [[H4057]] by way [[H1870]] of the Red [[H5488]] Sea, [[H3220]] as [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] had instructed me, [[H1696]] and for many [[H7227]] days [[H3117]] we wandered around [[H5437]] the hill country [[H2022]] of Seir. [[H8165]]

### 2
And the LORD [[H3068]] then said [[H559]] to me, [[H413]]

### 3
“You have been wandering around [[H5437]] this [[H2088]] hill country [[H2022]] long enough; [[H7227]] turn [[H6437]] to the north [[H6828]]

### 4
and command [[H6680]] the people: [[H5971]] ‘You [[H859]] will pass [[H5674]] through the territory [[H1366]] of your brothers, [[H251]] the descendants [[H1121]] of Esau, [[H6215]] who live [[H3427]] in Seir. [[H8165]] They will be afraid [[H3372]] of you, [[H4480]] so you must be very [[H3966]] careful. [[H8104]]

### 5
Do not [[H408]] provoke them, [[H1624]] for [[H3588]] I will not [[H3808]] give you [[H5414]] any of their land, [[H776]] not even [[H5704]] a footprint, [[H4096]] because [[H3588]] I have given [[H5414]] Esau [[H6215]] the hill country [[H2022]] of Seir [[H8165]] as his possession. [[H3425]]

### 6
You are to pay [[H7666]] them [[H853]] in silver [[H3701]] for the food [[H400]] you eat [[H398]] and [[H1571]] the water [[H4325]] you drink.’” [[H8354]]

### 7
Indeed, [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] has blessed [[H1288]] you in all [[H3605]] the work [[H4639]] of your hands. [[H3027]] He has watched over [[H3045]] your journey [[H1980]] through this [[H2088]] vast [[H1419]] wilderness. [[H4057]] The LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] has been with you [[H5973]] these [[H2088]] forty [[H705]] years, [[H8141]] and you have lacked [[H2637]] nothing. [[H3808]]

### 8
So we passed by [[H5674]] our brothers, [[H251]] the descendants [[H1121]] of Esau, [[H6215]] who live [[H3427]] in Seir. [[H8165]] We turned away [[H6437]] from the Arabah [[H6160]] road, [[H1870]] which comes up from Elath [[H359]] and Ezion-geber, [[H6100]] and traveled [[H5674]] along the road [[H1870]] of the Wilderness [[H4057]] of Moab. [[H4124]]

### 9
Then the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H559]] to me, [[H413]] ‘Do not [[H408]] harass [[H6696]] the Moabites [[H4124]] [or] [[H408]] provoke them [[H1624]] to war, [[H4421]] for [[H3588]] I will not [[H3808]] give [[H5414]] you  any of their land, [[H776]] because [[H3588]] I have given [[H5414]] Ar [[H6144]] as a possession [[H3425]] to the descendants [[H1121]] of Lot. [[H3876]]

### 10
(The Emites [[H368]] used to [[H6440]] live [[H3427]] there,  a people [[H5971]] great [[H1419]] and many, [[H7227]] as tall [[H7311]] as the Anakites. [[H6062]]

### 11
Like the Anakites, [[H6062]] they were also [[H637]] regarded [[H2803]] as Rephaim, [[H7497]] though the Moabites [[H4125]] called [[H7121]] them  Emites. [[H368]]

### 12
The Horites [[H2752]] used to [[H6440]] live [[H3427]] in Seir, [[H8165]] but the descendants [[H1121]] of Esau [[H6215]] drove them out, [[H3423]] destroying them completely [[H8045]] and settling [[H3427]] in their place, [[H8478]] just as [[H834]] Israel [[H3478]] did [[H6213]] in the land [[H776]] the LORD [[H3068]] gave them [[H5414]] as their possession.) [[H3425]]

### 13
Now [[H6258]] arise [[H6965]] and cross over [[H5674]] the Brook [[H5158]] of Zered.” [[H2218]] So we crossed over [[H5674]] the Brook [[H5158]] of Zered. [[H2218]]

### 14
The time [[H3117]] we spent traveling [[H1980]] from  Kadesh-barnea [[H6947]] until [[H5704]] we crossed over [[H5674]] the Brook [[H5158]] of Zered [[H2218]] was thirty-eight [[H7970]] years, [[H8141]] until [[H5704]] that entire [[H3605]] generation [[H1755]] of fighting [[H4421]] men [[H376]] had perished [[H8552]] from [[H7130]] the camp, [[H4264]] as [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] had sworn to them. [[H7650]]

### 15
Indeed, [[H1571]] the LORD’s [[H3068]] hand [[H3027]] was against them, [[H1961]] to eliminate them [[H2000]] from [[H7130]] the camp, [[H4264]] until [[H5704]] they had all perished. [[H8552]]

### 16
Now [[H1961]] when [[H834]] all [[H3605]] the fighting [[H4421]] men [[H582]] among [[H7130]] the people [[H5971]] had died, [[H4191]]

### 17
the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H1696]] to me, [[H413]]

### 18
“Today [[H3117]] you [[H859]] are going to cross [[H5674]] the border [[H1366]] of Moab [[H4124]] at Ar. [[H6144]]

### 19
But when you get close [[H7126]] to [[H4136]] the Ammonites, [[H1121]] do not [[H408]] harass them [[H6696]] or provoke them, [[H1624]] for [[H3588]] I will not [[H3808]] give you [[H5414]] any of the land [[H776]] of the Ammonites, [[H1121]] because [[H3588]] I have given [[H5414]] it as a possession [[H3425]] to the descendants [[H1121]] of Lot. [[H3876]]

### 20
(That too [[H637]] was regarded [[H2803]] as the land [[H776]] of the Rephaim, [[H7497]] [who] [[H7497]] used to live there, [[H3427]] though the Ammonites [[H5984]] called [[H7121]] them Zamzummites. [[H2157]]

### 21
[They were] a people [[H5971]] great [[H1419]] and many, [[H7227]] as tall [[H7311]] as the Anakites. [[H6062]] But the LORD [[H3068]] destroyed them [[H8045]] before [the Ammonites], [[H6440]] who drove them out [[H3423]] and settled [[H3427]] in their place, [[H8478]]

### 22
just as [[H834]] He had done [[H6213]] for the descendants [[H1121]] of Esau [[H6215]] who lived [[H3427]] in Seir, [[H8165]] when [[H834]] He destroyed [[H8045]] the Horites [[H2752]] before them. [[H6440]] They drove them out [[H3423]] and have lived [[H3427]] in their place [[H8478]] to [[H5704]] this [[H2088]] day. [[H3117]]

### 23
And the Avvim, [[H5757]] who lived [[H3427]] in villages [[H2699]] as [[H5704]] far as Gaza, [[H5804]] were destroyed by [[H8045]] the Caphtorites, [[H3732]] who came [[H3318]] out of Caphtor [[H3731]] and settled [[H3427]] in their place.) [[H8478]]

### 24
Arise, [[H6965]] set out, [[H5265]] and cross [[H5674]] the Arnon [[H769]] Valley. [[H5158]] See, [[H7200]] I have handed [[H3027]] Sihon [[H5511]] the Amorite, [[H567]] king [[H4428]] of Heshbon, [[H2809]] and his land [[H776]] over to you. [[H5414]] Begin [[H2490]] to take possession of it [[H3423]] and engage [[H1624]] him  in battle. [[H4421]]

### 25
This very [[H2088]] day [[H3117]] I will begin [[H2490]] to put [[H5414]] the dread [[H6343]] and fear [[H3374]] of you [[H5921]] upon all [[H3605]] the nations [[H5971]] under [[H8478]] heaven. [[H8064]] They will hear [[H8085]] the reports of you [[H8088]] and tremble [[H7264]] in anguish [[H2342]] because of you.” [[H6440]]

### 26
So from the Wilderness [[H4057]] of Kedemoth [[H6932]] I sent [[H7971]] messengers [[H4397]] with an offer [[H1697]] of peace [[H7965]] to [[H413]] Sihon [[H5511]] king [[H4428]] of Heshbon, [[H2809]] saying, [[H559]]

### 27
“Let us pass [[H5674]] through your land; [[H776]] we will stay on the main road. [[H1870]] We will not [[H3808]] turn [[H5493]] to the right [[H3225]] or to the left. [[H8040]]

### 28
You can sell [[H7666]] us food [[H400]] to eat [[H398]] [and] [[H5414]] water [[H4325]] to drink [[H8354]] in exchange for silver. [[H3701]] Only [[H7535]] let us pass through [[H5674]] on foot, [[H7272]]

### 29
just as [[H834]] the descendants [[H1121]] of Esau [[H6215]] who live [[H3427]] in Seir [[H8165]] and the Moabites [[H4125]] who live [[H3427]] in Ar [[H6144]] did for us, [[H6213]] until [[H5704]] we cross [[H5674]] the Jordan [[H3383]] into [[H413]] the land [[H776]] the LORD [[H3068]] our God [[H430]] is giving [[H5414]] us.” 

### 30
But Sihon [[H5511]] king [[H4428]] of Heshbon [[H2809]] would [[H14]] not [[H3808]] let us pass through, [[H5674]] for [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] had made his spirit [[H7307]] stubborn [[H7185]] and his heart [[H3824]] obstinate, [[H553]] that [[H4616]] He might give him [[H5414]] into your hands, [[H3027]] as is the case [[H2088]] this day. [[H3117]]

### 31
Then the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H559]] to me, [[H413]] “See, [[H7200]] I have begun [[H2490]] to deliver [[H5414]] Sihon [[H5511]] and his land [[H776]] to you. [[H6440]] Now [[H853]] begin [[H2490]] to conquer [[H3423]] and possess [[H3423]] his land.” [[H776]]

### 32
So Sihon [[H5511]] and his whole [[H3605]] army [[H5971]] came out [[H3318]] for battle [[H4421]] against us [[H7125]] at Jahaz. [[H3096]]

### 33
And the LORD [[H3068]] our God [[H430]] delivered him over [[H5414]] to us, [[H6440]] and we defeated him [[H5221]] and his sons [[H1121]] and his whole [[H3605]] army. [[H5971]]

### 34
At that [[H1931]] time [[H6256]] we captured [[H3920]] all [[H3605]] his cities [[H5892]] and completely destroyed [[H2763]] the people [[H4962]] of every [[H3605]] city, [[H5892]] including women [[H802]] and children. [[H2945]] We left [[H7604]] no [[H3808]] survivors. [[H8300]]

### 35
We carried off for ourselves only [[H7535]] the livestock [[H929]] and the plunder [[H7998]] from the cities [[H5892]] we captured. [[H3920]]

### 36
From Aroer [[H6177]] on [[H5921]] the rim [[H8193]] of the Arnon [[H769]] Valley, [[H5158]] along with the city [[H5892]] in the valley, [[H5158]] even as [[H5704]] far as Gilead, [[H1568]] not one [[H3808]] city [[H7151]] [had walls] [[H1961]] too high [[H7682]] for us. [[H4480]] The LORD [[H3068]] our God [[H430]] gave [[H5414]] us [[H6440]] all of them. [[H3605]]

### 37
But [[H7535]] you did not [[H3808]] go near [[H7126]] the land [[H776]] of the Ammonites, [[H1121]] or [the land] [[H3605]] along the banks [[H3027]] of the Jabbok [[H2999]] River, [[H5158]] or the cities [[H5892]] of the hill country, [[H2022]] or any [[H3605]] place that [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] our God [[H430]] had forbidden.
