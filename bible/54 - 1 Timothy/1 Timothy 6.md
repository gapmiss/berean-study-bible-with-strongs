###### 1
All who [[G3745]] are [[G1510]] under [[G5259]] [the] yoke [[G2218]] of slavery [[G1401]] should regard [[G2233]] [their] [[G3588]] masters [[G1203]] {as} fully [[G3956]] worthy [[G514]] of honor, [[G5092]] so that [[G2443]] God’s [[G2316]] name [[G3686]] and [[G2532]] [our] [[G3588]] teaching [[G1319]] will not be discredited. [[G987]]

###### 2
Those who [[G3588]] have [[G2192]] believing [[G4103]] masters [[G1203]] should not show disrespect [[G2706]] because [[G3754]] they are [[G1510]] brothers, [[G80]] but [[G235]] should serve [them] [[G1398]] all the more, [[G3123]] since [[G3754]] those [[G3588]] receiving [[G482]] [their] [[G3588]] good service [[G2108]] are [[G1510]] beloved [[G27]] believers. [[G4103]] Teach [[G1321]] and [[G2532]] encourage [[G3870]] these [principles]. [[G3778]]

###### 3
If [[G1487]] anyone [[G5100]] teaches another doctrine [[G2085]] and [[G2532]] disagrees [[G4334]] [with the] sound [[G5198]] words [[G3056]] of our [[G1473]] Lord [[G2962]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ [[G5547]] and [[G2532]] with [[G2596]] godly [[G2150]] teaching, [[G1319]]

###### 4
he is conceited [[G5187]] [and] understands [[G1987]] nothing. [[G3367]] Instead, [[G235]] [he has] an unhealthy interest [[G3552]] in [[G4012]] controversies [[G2214]] and [[G2532]] semantics, [[G3055]] out of [[G1537]] which [[G3739]] come [[G1096]] envy, [[G5355]] strife, [[G2054]] abusive talk, [[G988]] evil [[G4190]] suspicions, [[G5283]]

###### 5
[and] constant friction [[G3859]] between men [[G444]] of depraved [[G1311]] mind [[G3563]] [who are] [[G2532]] devoid [[G650]] of the truth. [[G225]] [These men] regard [[G3543]] godliness [[G2150]] as [[G1510]] a means of gain. [[G4200]]

###### 6
Of course, [[G1161]] godliness [[G2150]] with [[G3326]] contentment [[G841]] is [[G1510]] great [[G3173]] gain. [[G4200]]

###### 7
For [[G1063]] we brought [[G1533]] nothing [[G3762]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] world, [[G2889]] [and] [[G3754]] neither [[G3761]] can we [[G1410]] carry [[G1627]] anything {out of it}. [[G5100]]

###### 8
But [[G1161]] if we have [[G2192]] food [[G1305]] and [[G2532]] clothing, [[G4629]] we will be content [[G714]] with these. [[G3778]]

###### 9
Those who [[G3588]] want [[G1014]] to be rich, [[G4147]] however, [[G1161]] fall [[G1706]] into [[G1519]] temptation [[G3986]] and [[G2532]] become ensnared [[G3803]] by many [[G4183]] foolish [[G453]] and [[G2532]] harmful [[G983]] desires [[G1939]] that [[G3748]] plunge [[G1036]] [them] [[G444]] into [[G1519]] ruin [[G3639]] and [[G2532]] destruction. [[G684]]

###### 10
For [[G1063]] the [[G3588]] love of money [[G5365]] is [[G1510]] [the] root [[G4491]] of all kinds [[G3956]] of evil. [[G2556]] By craving [[G3713]] [it], [[G3739]] some [[G5100]] have wandered [[G635]] away from [[G575]] the [[G3588]] faith [[G4102]] and [[G2532]] pierced [[G4044]] themselves [[G1438]] with many [[G4183]] sorrows. [[G3601]]

###### 11
But [[G1161]] you, [[G4771]] O [[G5599]] man [[G444]] of God, [[G2316]] flee from [[G5343]] these things [[G3778]] and [[G1161]] pursue [[G1377]] righteousness, [[G1343]] godliness, [[G2150]] faith, [[G4102]] love, [[G26]] perseverance, [[G5281]] [and] gentleness. [[G4240]]

###### 12
Fight [[G75]] the [[G3588]] good [[G2570]] fight [[G73]] of the [[G3588]] faith. [[G4102]] Take hold [[G1949]] of the [[G3588]] eternal [[G166]] life [[G2222]] to [[G1519]] which [[G3739]] you were called [[G2564]] [when you made] [[G3670]] the [[G3588]] good [[G2570]] confession [[G3671]] before [[G1799]] many [[G4183]] witnesses. [[G3144]]

###### 13
I charge [[G3853]] you [[G4771]] in the presence [[G1799]] of God, [[G2316]] who [[G3588]] gives life [[G2225]] to [[G3588]] all things, [[G3956]] and [[G2532]] of Christ [[G5547]] Jesus, [[G2424]] who [[G3588]] {made} the [[G3588]] good [[G2570]] confession [[G3671]] in His testimony [[G3140]] before [[G1909]] Pontius [[G4194]] Pilate: [[G4091]]

###### 14
Keep [[G5083]] [this] [[G3588]] commandment [[G1785]] without stain [[G784]] [or] reproach [[G423]] until [[G3360]] the [[G3588]] appearance [[G2015]] of our [[G1473]] Lord [[G2962]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ, [[G5547]]

###### 15
which [[G3739]] [God] will bring about [[G1166]] in [His] [[G3588]] own [[G2398]] time— [[G2540]] [He who is] blessed [[G3107]] and [[G2532]] [the] only [[G3441]] Sovereign [One], [[G1413]] the [[G3588]] King [[G935]] of [[G3588]] kings [[G936]] and [[G2532]] Lord [[G2962]] of [[G3588]] lords. [[G2961]]

###### 16
[He] [[G3588]] alone [[G3441]] is [[G2192]] immortal [[G110]] [and] dwells [[G3611]] in unapproachable [[G676]] light. [[G5457]] No one [[G3762]] has ever seen [[G3708]] [Him], [[G3739]] nor [[G3761]] can [anyone] [[G1410]] see [Him]. [[G3708]] To [Him be] [[G3739]] honor [[G5092]] and [[G2532]] eternal [[G166]] dominion! [[G2904]] Amen. [[G281]]

###### 17
Instruct [[G3853]] those who are [[G3588]] rich [[G4145]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] present [[G3568]] age [[G165]] not [[G3361]] to be conceited [[G5309]] [and] not [[G3366]] to put their hope [[G1679]] in [[G1909]] [the] uncertainty [[G83]] of wealth, [[G4149]] but [[G235]] in [[G1909]] God, [[G2316]] who [[G3588]] richly [[G4146]] provides [[G3930]] all things [[G3956]] for us [[G1473]] to [[G1519]] enjoy. [[G619]]

###### 18
[Instruct them] to do good, [[G14]] to be rich [[G4147]] in [[G1722]] good [[G2570]] works, [[G2041]] [and] to be [[G1510]] generous [[G2130]] [and] ready to share, [[G2843]]

###### 19
treasuring up [[G597]] for themselves [[G1438]] a firm [[G2570]] foundation [[G2310]] for [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] future, [[G3195]] so that [[G2443]] they may take hold [[G1949]] of [[G3588]] that which is truly [[G3689]] life. [[G2222]]

###### 20
O [[G5599]] Timothy, [[G5095]] guard [[G5442]] the [[G3588]] deposit entrusted [to you]. [[G3866]] Avoid [[G1624]] irreverent [[G952]] chatter [[G2757]] and [[G2532]] the opposing arguments [[G477]] of so-called [[G5581]] “knowledge,” [[G1108]]

###### 21
which [[G3739]] some [[G5100]] have professed [[G1861]] and [thus] swerved away [[G795]] from [[G4012]] the [[G3588]] faith. [[G4102]] Grace [be] [[G5485]] with [[G3326]] you all. [[G4771]]
