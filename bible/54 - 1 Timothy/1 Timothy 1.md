# 1 Timothy 1

[[2 Thessalonians 3|←]] • [[1 Timothy 2|→]]

---

### 1
Paul, [[G3972]] an apostle [[G652]] of Christ [[G5547]] Jesus [[G2424]] by [[G2596]] [the] command [[G2003]] of God [[G2316]] our [[G1473]] Savior [[G4990]] and [[G2532]] of Christ [[G5547]] Jesus [[G2424]] our [[G1473]] hope, [[G1680]]

### 2
To Timothy, [[G5095]] [my] true [[G1103]] child [[G5043]] in [[G1722]] [the] faith: [[G4102]] Grace, [[G5485]] mercy, [[G1656]] [and] peace [[G1515]] from [[G575]] God [[G2316]] [the] Father [[G3962]] and [[G2532]] Christ [[G5547]] Jesus [[G2424]] our [[G1473]] Lord. [[G2962]]

### 3
As [[G2531]] I urged [[G3870]] you [[G4771]] on my departure [[G4198]] to [[G1519]] Macedonia, [[G3109]] you should stay on [[G4357]] at [[G1722]] Ephesus [[G2181]] to [[G2443]] instruct [[G3853]] certain men [[G5100]] not [[G3361]] to teach false doctrines [[G2085]]

### 4
[or] [[G3366]] devote themselves [[G4337]] to myths [[G3454]] and [[G2532]] endless [[G562]] genealogies, [[G1076]] which [[G3748]] promote [[G3930]] speculation [[G2214]] rather [[G3123]] than [[G2228]] [the] stewardship [[G3622]] of God’s [work], [[G2316]] which [is] [[G3588]] by [[G1722]] faith. [[G4102]]

### 5
The [[G3588]] goal [[G5056]] of [our] [[G3588]] instruction [[G3852]] is [[G1510]] [the] love [[G26]] [that comes] from [[G1537]] a pure [[G2513]] heart, [[G2588]] a clear [[G18]] conscience, [[G4893]] and [[G2532]] a sincere [[G505]] faith. [[G4102]]

### 6
Some [[G5100]] have strayed [[G795]] from [ these ways ] [[G3739]] [and] turned aside [[G1624]] to [[G1519]] empty talk. [[G3150]]

### 7
They want [[G2309]] to be [[G1510]] teachers of the Law, [[G3547]] [but] they do not understand [[G3539]] what [[G3739]] they are saying [[G3004]] [or] [[G3383]] [that] [[G4012]] which [[G5101]] they so confidently assert. [[G1226]]

### 8
Now [[G1161]] we know [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] the [[G3588]] Law [[G3551]] [is] good, [[G2570]] if [[G1437]] one [[G5100]] uses [[G5530]] it [[G846]] legitimately. [[G3545]]

### 9
We realize [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] law [[G3551]] is not enacted [[G2749]] for [the] righteous, [[G1342]] but [[G1161]] for [the] lawless [[G459]] and [[G2532]] rebellious, [[G506]] for [the] ungodly [[G765]] and [[G2532]] sinful, [[G268]] for [the] unholy [[G462]] and [[G2532]] profane, [[G952]] for killers of father [[G3964]] [or] [[G2532]] mother, [[G3389]] for murderers, [[G409]]

### 10
for the sexually immoral, [[G4205]] for homosexuals, [[G733]] for slave traders [[G405]] [and] liars [[G5583]] [and] perjurers, [[G1965]] and [[G2532]] for [[G1487]] anyone [[G5100]] else [[G2087]] who is averse to [[G480]] sound [[G5198]] teaching [[G1319]]

### 11
that agrees with [[G2596]] the [[G3588]] glorious [[G1391]] gospel [[G2098]] of the [[G3588]] blessed [[G3107]] God, [[G2316]] with which [[G3739]] I [[G1473]] have been entrusted. [[G4100]]

### 12
I [[G2192]] thank [[G5485]] Christ [[G5547]] Jesus [[G2424]] our [[G1473]] Lord, [[G2962]] who [[G3588]] has strengthened [[G1743]] me, [[G1473]] that [[G3754]] He considered [[G2233]] me [[G1473]] faithful [[G4103]] [and] appointed [me] [[G5087]] to [[G1519]] service. [[G1248]]

### 13
I was [[G1510]] formerly [[G4386]] a blasphemer, [[G989]] a persecutor, [[G1376]] and [[G2532]] a violent [man]; [[G5197]] yet [[G235]] because [[G3754]] I had acted [[G4160]] in [[G1722]] ignorance [[G50]] [and] unbelief, [[G570]] I was shown mercy. [[G1653]]

### 14
And [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] grace [[G5485]] of our [[G1473]] Lord [[G2962]] overflowed [to me], [[G5250]] along with [[G3326]] [the] faith [[G4102]] and [[G2532]] love [[G26]] that [are] [[G3588]] in [[G1722]] Christ [[G5547]] Jesus. [[G2424]]

### 15
[This is a] trustworthy [[G4103]] saying, [[G3056]] worthy [[G514]] of full [[G3956]] acceptance: [[G594]] Christ [[G5547]] Jesus [[G2424]] came [[G2064]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] world [[G2889]] to save [[G4982]] sinners, [[G268]] of whom [[G3739]] I [[G1473]] am [[G1510]] [the] worst. [[G4413]]

### 16
But [[G235]] for this very reason [[G1223]] I was shown mercy, [[G1653]] so that [[G2443]] in [[G1722]] me, [[G1473]] [the] worst [ of sinners ], [[G4413]] Christ [[G5547]] Jesus [[G2424]] might display [[G1731]] [His] [[G3588]] perfect [[G537]] patience, [[G3115]] as [[G4314]] an example [[G5296]] to those who [[G3588]] would [[G3195]] believe [[G4100]] in [[G1909]] Him [[G846]] for [[G1519]] eternal [[G166]] life. [[G2222]]

### 17
Now [[G1161]] to [[G3588]] [the] King [[G935]] eternal, [[G165]] immortal, [[G862]] [and] invisible, [[G517]] [the] only [[G3441]] God, [[G2316]] [be] honor [[G5092]] and [[G2532]] glory [[G1391]] forever [[G165]] [and] [[G3588]] ever. [[G165]] Amen. [[G281]]

### 18
Timothy, [[G5095]] [my] child, [[G5043]] I entrust [[G3908]] you with [[G4771]] this [[G3778]] command [[G3852]] in keeping with [[G2596]] the [[G3588]] previous [[G4254]] prophecies [[G4394]] about [[G1909]] you, [[G4771]] so that [[G2443]] by [[G1722]] them [[G846]] you may fight [[G4754]] the [[G3588]] good [[G2570]] fight, [[G4752]]

### 19
holding on [[G2192]] to faith [[G4102]] and [[G2532]] a good [[G18]] conscience, [[G4893]] which [[G3739]] some [[G5100]] have rejected [[G683]] [and thereby] shipwrecked [[G3489]] [their] [[G3588]] faith. [[G4102]]

### 20
Among [them] [[G3739]] are [[G1510]] Hymenaeus [[G5211]] and [[G2532]] Alexander, [[G223]] whom [[G3739]] I have handed over [[G3860]] to Satan [[G4567]] to [[G2443]] be taught [[G3811]] not [[G3361]] to blaspheme. [[G987]]
