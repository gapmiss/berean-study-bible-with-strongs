### 1
Yes, [[H3588]] in those [[H1992]] days [[H3117]] and at that [[H1931]] time, [[H6256]] when [[H834]] I restore [[H7725]] from captivity [[H7622]] Judah [[H3063]] and Jerusalem, [[H3389]]

### 2
I will gather [[H6908]] all [[H3605]] the nations [[H1471]] and bring them down [[H3381]] to [[H413]] the Valley [[H6010]] of Jehoshaphat. [[H3092]] There [[H8033]] I will enter into judgment [[H8199]] against them [[H5973]] concerning [[H5921]] My people, [[H5971]] My inheritance, [[H5159]] Israel, [[H3478]] whom [[H834]] they have scattered [[H6340]] among the nations [[H1471]] as [[H853]] they divided up [[H2505]] My land. [[H776]]

### 3
They cast [[H3032]] lots [[H1486]] for [[H413]] My people; [[H5971]] they bartered [[H5414]] a boy [[H3206]] for a prostitute [[H2181]] and sold [[H4376]] a girl [[H3207]] for wine [[H3196]] to drink. [[H8354]]

### 4
Now [[H1571]] what [[H4100]] have you [[H859]] against Me,  O Tyre, [[H6865]] Sidon, [[H6721]] and all [[H3605]] the regions [[H1552]] of Philistia— [[H6429]] are you [[H859]] rendering [[H7999]] Me [[H5921]] a recompense? [[H1576]] But if [[H518]] you [[H859]] retaliate [[H1580]] against Me, [[H5921]] I will swiftly [[H7031]] and speedily [[H4120]] return [[H7725]] retribution [[H1576]] on your heads. [[H7218]]

### 5
For [[H834]] you took [[H3947]] My silver [[H3701]] and gold [[H2091]] and carried off [[H935]] My finest [[H2896]] treasures [[H4261]] to your temples. [[H1964]]

### 6
You sold [[H4376]] the people [[H1121]] of Judah [[H3063]] and Jerusalem [[H3389]] to the Greeks, [[H1121]] to [[H4616]] send them far [[H7368]] from [[H5921]] their homeland. [[H1366]]

### 7
Behold, [[H2005]] I will rouse them [[H5782]] from [[H4480]] the places [[H4725]] to which [[H834]] you sold [[H4376]] them; [[H853]] I will return [[H7725]] retribution [[H1576]] on your heads. [[H7218]]

### 8
I will sell [[H4376]] your sons [[H1121]] and daughters [[H1323]] into the hands [[H3027]] of the people [[H1121]] of Judah, [[H3063]] and they will sell [[H4376]] them to the Sabeans, [[H7615]] to [[H413]] a distant [[H7350]] nation.” [[H1471]] Indeed, [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] has spoken. [[H1696]]

### 9
Proclaim [[H7121]] this [[H2063]] among the nations: [[H1471]] “Prepare [[H6942]] for war; [[H4421]] rouse [[H5782]] the mighty men; [[H1368]] let all [[H3605]] the men [[H582]] of war [[H4421]] advance [[H5066]] and attack! [[H5927]]

### 10
Beat [[H3807]] your plowshares [[H855]] into swords [[H2719]] and your pruning hooks [[H4211]] into spears. [[H7420]] Let the weak [[H2523]] say, [[H559]] ‘I [am] [[H589]] strong!’ [[H1368]]

### 11
Come [[H935]] quickly, [[H5789]] all [[H3605]] you nations [[H1471]] on every side [[H5439]] and gather yourselves. [[H6908]] Bring down [[H5181]] Your mighty ones, [[H1368]] O LORD. [[H3068]]

### 12
Let the nations [[H1471]] be roused [[H5782]] and advance [[H5927]] into [[H413]] the Valley [[H6010]] of Jehoshaphat, [[H3092]] for [[H3588]] there [[H8033]] I will sit down [[H3427]] to judge [[H8199]] all [[H3605]] the nations [[H1471]] on every side. [[H5439]]

### 13
Swing [[H7971]] the sickle, [[H4038]] for [[H3588]] the harvest [[H7105]] is ripe. [[H1310]] Come, [[H935]] trample the grapes, [[H3381]] for [[H3588]] the winepress [[H1660]] is full; [[H4390]] the wine vats [[H3342]] overflow [[H7783]] because [[H3588]] their wickedness [[H7451]] is great. [[H7227]]

### 14
Multitudes, [[H1995]] multitudes [[H1995]] in the valley [[H6010]] of decision! [[H2742]] For [[H3588]] the Day [[H3117]] of the LORD [[H3068]] is near [[H7138]] in the valley [[H6010]] of decision. [[H2742]]

### 15
The sun [[H8121]] and moon [[H3394]] grow dark, [[H6937]] and the stars [[H3556]] no longer [[H622]] shine. [[H5051]]

### 16
The LORD [[H3068]] will roar [[H7580]] from Zion [[H6726]] and raise [[H5414]] His voice [[H6963]] from Jerusalem; [[H3389]] heaven [[H8064]] and earth [[H776]] will tremble. [[H7493]] But the LORD [[H3068]] will be a refuge [[H4268]] for His people, [[H5971]] a stronghold [[H4581]] for the people [[H1121]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

### 17
Then you will know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I [[H589]] am the LORD [[H3068]] your God, [[H430]] who dwells [[H7931]] in Zion, [[H6726]] My holy [[H6944]] mountain. [[H2022]] Jerusalem [[H3389]] will be [[H1961]] holy, [[H6944]] never [[H3808]] again [[H5750]] to be overrun [[H5674]] by foreigners. [[H2114]]

### 18
And [[H1961]] in that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] the mountains [[H2022]] will drip [[H5197]] with sweet wine, [[H6071]] and the hills [[H1389]] will flow [[H1980]] with milk. [[H2461]] All [[H3605]] the streams [[H650]] of Judah [[H3063]] will run [[H1980]] with water, [[H4325]] and a spring [[H4599]] will flow [[H3318]] from the house [[H1004]] of the LORD [[H3068]] to water [[H8248]] the Valley [[H5158]] of Acacias. [[H7851]]

### 19
Egypt [[H4714]] will become [[H1961]] desolate, [[H8077]] and Edom [[H123]] a desert [[H4057]] wasteland, [[H8077]] because of the violence [[H2555]] done to the people [[H1121]] of Judah, [[H3063]] in whose [[H834]] land [[H776]] they shed [[H8210]] innocent [[H5355]] blood. [[H1818]]

### 20
But Judah [[H3063]] will be inhabited forever, [[H3427]] and Jerusalem [[H3389]] from generation [[H1755]] to generation. [[H1755]]

### 21
For I will acquit [[H5352]] their bloodguilt [[H1818]] which I have not yet [[H3808]] acquitted.” [[H5352]] For the LORD [[H3068]] dwells [[H7931]] in Zion. [[H6726]]
