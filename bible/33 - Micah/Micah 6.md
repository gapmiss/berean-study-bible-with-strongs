###### 1
Hear [[H8085]] now [[H4994]] what [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] says: [[H559]] “Arise, [[H6965]] plead your case [[H7378]] before [[H854]] the mountains, [[H2022]] and let the hills [[H1389]] hear [[H8085]] your voice. [[H6963]]

###### 2
Hear, [[H8085]] O mountains, [[H2022]] the LORD's [[H3069]] indictment, [[H7379]] you enduring [[H386]] foundations [[H4146]] of the earth. [[H776]] For [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3069]] has a case [[H7379]] against [[H5973]] His people, [[H5971]] and He will argue [[H3198]] it against [[H5973]] Israel. [[H3478]]

###### 3
My people, [[H5971]] what [[H4100]] have I done [[H6213]] to you?  Testify [[H6030]] against Me  how [[H4100]] I have wearied you! [[H3811]]

###### 4
For [[H3588]] I brought you up [[H5927]] from the land [[H776]] of Egypt [[H4714]] and redeemed you [[H6299]] from the house [[H1004]] of bondage. [[H5650]] I sent [[H7971]] Moses [[H4872]] before you, [[H6440]] as well as Aaron [[H175]] and Miriam. [[H4813]]

###### 5
My people, [[H5971]] remember [[H2142]] what [[H4100]] Balak [[H1111]] king [[H4428]] of Moab [[H4124]] counseled [[H3289]] and what [[H4100]] Balaam [[H1109]] son [[H1121]] of Beor [[H1160]] answered. [[H6030]] Remember [your journey] from [[H4480]] Acacia Grove [[H7851]] to [[H5704]] Gilgal, [[H1537]] so that [[H4616]] you may acknowledge [[H3045]] the righteousness [[H6666]] of the LORD.” [[H3068]]

###### 6
With what [[H4100]] shall I come before [[H6923]] the LORD [[H3068]] when I bow [[H3721]] before the God [[H430]] on high? [[H4791]] Should I come to Him [[H6923]] with burnt offerings, [[H5930]] with year-old [[H1121]] calves? [[H5695]]

###### 7
Would the LORD [[H3068]] be pleased [[H7521]] with thousands [[H505]] of rams, [[H352]] with ten thousand [[H7233]] rivers [[H5158]] of oil? [[H8081]] Shall I present [[H5414]] my firstborn [[H1060]] for my transgression, [[H6588]] the fruit [[H6529]] of my body [[H990]] [for] the sin [[H2403]] of my soul? [[H5315]]

###### 8
He has shown [[H5046]] you,  O mankind, [[H120]] what [is] [[H4100]] good. [[H2896]] And what [[H4100]] does the LORD [[H3068]] require [[H1875]] of you [[H4480]] but [[H518]] to act [[H6213]] justly, [[H4941]] to love [[H160]] mercy, [[H2617]] and to walk [[H1980]] humbly [[H6800]] with [[H5973]] your God? [[H430]]

###### 9
The voice [[H6963]] of the LORD [[H3068]] calls out [[H7121]] to the city— [[H5892]] and it is sound wisdom [[H8454]] to fear [[H3372]] Your name— [[H8034]] “Heed [[H8085]] the rod [[H4294]] and the One [[H4310]] who ordained it. [[H3259]]

###### 10
Can I forget any longer, [[H5750]] O house [[H1004]] of the wicked, [[H7563]] the treasures [[H214]] of wickedness [[H7562]] and the short [[H7332]] ephah, [[H374]] which is accursed? [[H2194]]

###### 11
Can I excuse [[H2135]] dishonest [[H7562]] scales [[H3976]] or bags [[H3599]] of false [[H4820]] weights? [[H68]]

###### 12
For [[H834]] the wealthy of the city [[H6223]] are full of [[H4390]] violence, [[H2555]] and its residents [[H3427]] speak [[H1696]] lies; [[H8267]] their tongues [[H3956]] are deceitful [[H7423]] in their mouths. [[H6310]]

###### 13
Therefore [[H1571]] I [[H589]] will strike you [[H5221]] severely, [[H2470]] to ruin you [[H8074]] because of [[H5921]] your sins. [[H2403]]

###### 14
You [[H859]] will eat [[H398]] but not [[H3808]] be satisfied, [[H7646]] and your hunger [[H3445]] will remain with you. [[H7130]] What you acquire, [[H5253]] you will not [[H3808]] preserve; [[H6403]] and what [[H834]] you save, [[H6403]] I will give over [[H5414]] to the sword. [[H2719]]

###### 15
You [[H859]] will sow [[H2232]] but not [[H3808]] reap; [[H7114]] you [[H859]] will press [[H1869]] olives [[H2132]] but not [[H3808]] anoint yourselves [[H5480]] with oil; [[H8081]] you will tread grapes [[H8492]] but not [[H3808]] drink [[H8354]] the wine. [[H3196]]

###### 16
You have observed [[H8104]] the statutes [[H2708]] of Omri [[H6018]] and all [[H3605]] the practices [[H4639]] of Ahab’s [[H256]] house; [[H1004]] you have followed [[H1980]] their traditions. [[H4156]] Therefore [[H4616]] I will make [[H5414]] you [[H853]] a desolation, [[H8047]] and your inhabitants [[H3427]] an object of contempt; [[H8322]] you will bear [[H5375]] the scorn [[H2781]] of the nations.” [[H5971]]
