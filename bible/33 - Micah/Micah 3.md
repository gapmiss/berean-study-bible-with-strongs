### 1
Then I said: [[H559]] “Hear [[H8085]] now, [[H4994]] O leaders [[H7218]] of Jacob, [[H3290]] you rulers [[H7101]] of the house [[H1004]] of Israel. [[H3478]] Should you not [[H3808]] know [[H3045]] justice? [[H4941]]

### 2
You hate [[H8130]] good [[H2896]] and love [[H157]] evil. [[H7451]] You tear [[H1497]] the skin [[H5785]] from My people [[H5921]] and strip the flesh [[H7607]] from [[H5921]] their bones. [[H6106]]

### 3
You eat [[H398]] the flesh [[H7607]] of my people [[H5971]] after stripping off [[H6584]] their skin [[H5785]] and breaking [[H6476]] their bones. [[H6106]] You chop them up [[H6566]] like [meat] [[H834]] for the cooking pot, [[H5518]] like meat [[H1320]] in [[H8432]] a kettle.” [[H7037]]

### 4
Then [[H227]] they will cry out [[H2199]] to [[H413]] the LORD, [[H3068]] but He will not [[H3808]] answer [[H6030]] them. [[H853]] At that [[H1931]] time [[H6256]] He will hide [[H5641]] His face [[H6440]] from them [[H1992]] because of [[H834]] the evil [[H7489]] they have done. [[H4611]]

### 5
This is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] says: [[H559]] “As for [[H5921]] the prophets [[H5030]] who lead My people [[H5971]] astray, [[H8582]] who proclaim [[H7121]] peace [[H7965]] while they chew [[H5391]] with their teeth, [[H8127]] but declare [[H6942]] war [[H4421]] against one [[H5921]] who puts [[H5414]] nothing [[H3808]] in [[H5921]] their mouths: [[H6310]]

### 6
Therefore [[H3651]] the night [[H3915]] will come over you  without visions, [[H2377]] and the darkness [[H2821]] without divination. [[H7080]] The sun [[H8121]] will set [[H935]] on [[H5921]] these prophets, [[H5030]] and the daylight [[H3117]] will turn black [[H6937]] over them. [[H5921]]

### 7
Then the seers [[H2374]] will be ashamed [[H954]] and the diviners [[H7080]] disgraced. [[H2659]] They will all [[H3605]] cover [[H5844]] their mouths [[H8222]] because [[H3588]] [there is] no [[H369]] answer [[H4617]] from God. [[H430]]

### 8
As for me, [[H595]] however, [[H199]] I am filled [[H4390]] with power [[H3581]] by [[H853]] the Spirit [[H7307]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] with justice [[H4941]] and courage, [[H1369]] to declare [[H5046]] to Jacob [[H3290]] his transgression [[H6588]] and to Israel [[H3478]] his sin. [[H2403]]

### 9
Now [[H4994]] hear [[H8085]] this, [[H2063]] O leaders [[H7218]] of the house [[H1004]] of Jacob [[H3290]] and rulers [[H7101]] of the house [[H1004]] of Israel, [[H3478]] who despise [[H8581]] justice [[H4941]] and pervert [[H6140]] all [[H3605]] that is right, [[H3477]]

### 10
who build [[H1129]] Zion [[H6726]] with bloodshed [[H1818]] and Jerusalem [[H3389]] with iniquity. [[H5766]]

### 11
Her leaders [[H7218]] judge [[H8199]] for a bribe, [[H7810]] her priests [[H3548]] teach [[H3384]] for a price, [[H4242]] and her prophets [[H5030]] practice divination [[H7080]] for money. [[H3701]] Yet they lean [[H8172]] upon [[H5921]] the LORD, [[H3068]] saying, [[H559]] “Is not [[H3808]] the LORD [[H3068]] among us? [[H7130]] No [[H3808]] disaster [[H7451]] can come [[H935]] upon us. [[H5921]]

### 12
Therefore, [[H3651]] because of you, [[H1558]] Zion [[H6726]] will be plowed [[H2790]] like a field, [[H7704]] Jerusalem [[H3389]] will become [[H1961]] a heap of rubble, [[H5856]] and the temple [[H1004]] mount [[H2022]] a wooded [[H3293]] ridge. [[H1116]]
