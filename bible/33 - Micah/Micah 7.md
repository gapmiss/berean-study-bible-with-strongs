# Micah 7

[[Micah 6|←]] • [[Nahum 1|→]]

---

### 1
Woe is [[H480]] me!  For [[H3588]] I am [[H1961]] like one gathering [[H625]] summer fruit [[H7019]] at the gleaning [[H5955]] of the vineyard; [[H1210]] there [is no] [[H369]] cluster [[H811]] to eat, [[H398]] no early fig [[H1063]] that I [[H5315]] crave. [[H183]]

### 2
The godly [man] [[H2623]] has perished [[H6]] from [[H4480]] the earth; [[H776]] there is no [[H369]] one upright [[H3477]] among men. [[H120]] They all [[H3605]] lie in wait [[H693]] for blood; [[H1818]] they hunt [[H6679]] each [[H376]] other [[H251]] with a net. [[H2764]]

### 3
Both hands [[H3709]] are skilled [[H3190]] at evil; [[H7451]] the prince [[H8269]] and the judge [[H8199]] demand [[H7592]] a bribe; [[H7966]] when the powerful [[H1419]] utters [[H1696]] his [[H1931]] evil [[H1942]] desire, [[H5315]] they all conspire together. [[H5686]]

### 4
The best of them [is] [[H2896]] like a brier; [[H2312]] the most upright [is sharper] [[H3477]] then a hedge of thorns. [[H4534]] The day [[H3117]] you post your watchmen, [[H6822]] your punishment [[H6486]] will come; [[H935]] then [[H6258]] their confusion [[H3998]] will arise. [[H1961]]

### 5
Do not [[H408]] rely [[H539]] on a friend; [[H7453]] do not [[H408]] trust [[H982]] in a companion. [[H441]] Seal [[H8104]] the doors [[H6607]] of your mouth [[H6310]] from her who lies [[H7901]] in your arms. [[H2436]]

### 6
For [[H3588]] a son [[H1121]] dishonors [[H5034]] his father, [[H1]] a daughter [[H1323]] rises [[H6965]] against her mother, [[H517]] and a daughter-in-law [[H3618]] against her mother-in-law; [[H2545]] a man’s [[H376]] enemies [are] [[H341]] the members of his own household. [[H1004]]

### 7
But as for me, [[H589]] I will look [[H6822]] to the LORD; [[H3068]] I will wait [[H3176]] for the God [[H430]] of my salvation. [[H3468]] My God [[H430]] will hear me. [[H8085]]

### 8
Do not [[H408]] gloat [[H8056]] over me,  my enemy! [[H341]] Though [[H3588]] I have fallen, [[H5307]] I will arise; [[H6965]] though [[H3588]] I sit [[H3427]] in darkness, [[H2822]] the LORD [[H3068]] will be my light. [[H216]]

### 9
Because [[H3588]] I have sinned [[H2398]] against Him,  I must endure [[H5375]] the rage [[H2197]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] until [[H5704]] He argues [[H7378]] my case [[H7379]] and executes [[H6213]] justice for me. [[H4941]] He will bring [[H3318]] me into the light; [[H216]] I will see [[H7200]] His righteousness. [[H6666]]

### 10
Then my enemy [[H341]] will see [[H7200]] and will be covered [[H3680]] with shame— [[H955]] she who said [[H559]] to me, [[H413]] “Where [[H346]] is the LORD [[H3068]] your God?” [[H430]] My eyes [[H5869]] will see [[H7200]] her;  at that time [[H6258]] she will be [[H1961]] trampled [[H4823]] like mud [[H2916]] in the streets. [[H2351]]

### 11
The day [[H3117]] for rebuilding [[H1129]] your walls will come— [[H1447]] the [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] for extending [[H7368]] your boundary. [[H2706]]

### 12
On that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] they will come [[H935]] to you [[H5704]] from [[H4480]] Assyria [[H804]] and the cities [[H5892]] of Egypt, [[H4692]] even from [[H4480]] Egypt [[H4693]] to [[H5704]] the Euphrates [[H5104]] and from sea [[H3220]] to sea [[H3220]] and mountain [[H2022]] to mountain. [[H2022]]

### 13
Then the earth [[H776]] will become [[H1961]] desolate [[H8077]] because of [[H5921]] its inhabitants, [[H3427]] as the result [[H6529]] of their deeds. [[H4611]]

### 14
Shepherd [[H7462]] with Your staff [[H7626]] Your people, [[H5971]] the flock [[H6629]] of Your inheritance. [[H5159]] They live [[H7931]] alone [[H910]] in a woodland, [[H3293]] surrounded by [[H8432]] pastures. [[H3760]] Let them graze [[H7462]] in Bashan [[H1316]] and Gilead, [[H1568]] as in the days [[H3117]] of old. [[H5769]]

### 15
As in the days when [[H3117]] you came out [[H3318]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] I will show [[H7200]] My wonders. [[H6381]]

### 16
Nations [[H1471]] will see [[H7200]] and be ashamed, [[H954]] deprived of all [[H3605]] their might. [[H1369]] They will put [[H7760]] their hands [[H3027]] over [[H5921]] their mouths, [[H6310]] and their ears [[H241]] will become deaf. [[H2790]]

### 17
They will lick [[H3897]] the dust [[H6083]] like a snake, [[H5175]] like reptiles slithering [[H2119]] on the ground. [[H776]] They will crawl [[H7264]] from their holes [[H4526]] in the presence of [[H413]] the LORD [[H3068]] our God; [[H430]] they will tremble [[H6342]] in fear [[H3372]] of you. [[H4480]]

### 18
Who [[H4310]] is a God [[H410]] like You, [[H3644]] who pardons [[H5375]] iniquity [[H5771]] and passes [[H5674]] over [[H5921]] the transgression [[H6588]] of the remnant [[H7611]] of His inheritance— [[H5159]] who does not [[H3808]] retain [[H2388]] His anger [[H639]] forever, [[H5703]] because [[H3588]] He [[H1931]] delights [[H2654]] in loving devotion? [[H2617]]

### 19
He will again [[H7725]] have compassion on us; [[H7355]] He will vanquish [[H3533]] our iniquities. [[H5771]] You will cast out [[H7993]] all [[H3605]] our sins [[H2403]] into the depths [[H4688]] of the sea. [[H3220]]

### 20
You will show [[H5414]] loyalty [[H571]] to Jacob [[H3290]] and loving devotion [[H2617]] to Abraham, [[H85]] as [[H834]] You swore [[H7650]] to our fathers [[H1]] from days [[H3117]] of old. [[H6924]]
