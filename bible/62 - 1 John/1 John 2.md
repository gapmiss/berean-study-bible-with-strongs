###### 1
My [[G1473]] little children, [[G5040]] I am writing [[G1125]] these things [[G3778]] to you [[G4771]] so that [[G2443]] you will not sin. [[G264]] [But] [[G2532]] if [[G1437]] anyone [[G5100]] does sin, [[G264]] we have [[G2192]] an advocate [[G3875]] before [[G4314]] the [[G3588]] Father— [[G3962]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ, [[G5547]] [the] Righteous [One]. [[G1342]]

###### 2
He Himself [[G846]] is [[G1510]] [the] atoning sacrifice [[G2434]] for [[G4012]] our [[G1473]] sins, [[G266]] and [[G1161]] not [[G3756]] only [[G3440]] for [[G4012]] ours [[G2251]] but [[G235]] also [[G2532]] for [[G4012]] the [sins] [[G3588]] of [the] whole [[G3650]] world. [[G2889]]

###### 3
By [[G1722]] this [[G3778]] we can be sure [[G1097]] that [[G3754]] we have come to know [[G1097]] Him: [[G846]] if [[G1437]] we keep [[G5083]] His [[G846]] commandments. [[G1785]]

###### 4
If anyone [[G3588]] says, [[G3004]] “I know [[G1097]] Him,” [[G846]] [but] [[G2532]] does not keep [[G5083]] His [[G846]] commandments, [[G1785]] he is [[G1510]] a liar, [[G5583]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] truth [[G225]] is [[G1510]] not [[G3756]] in [[G1722]] him. [[G3778]]

###### 5
But [[G1161]] if anyone [[G3739]] keeps [[G5083]] His [[G846]] word, [[G3056]] the [[G3588]] love [[G26]] of God [[G2316]] has been truly perfected [[G5048]] in [[G1722]] him. [[G3778]] By [[G1722]] this [[G3778]] we know [[G1097]] that [[G3754]] we are [[G1510]] in [[G1722]] Him: [[G846]]

###### 6
Whoever [[G3588]] claims [[G3004]] to abide [[G3306]] in [[G1722]] Him [[G846]] must [[G3784]] walk [[G4043]] as [[G2531]] [Jesus] [[G1565]] walked. [[G4043]]

###### 7
Beloved, [[G27]] I am not writing [[G1125]] you [[G4771]] a new [[G2537]] commandment, [[G1785]] but [[G235]] an old [[G3820]] [one], [[G1785]] which [[G3739]] you have had [[G2192]] from [[G575]] [the] beginning. [[G746]] [This] [[G3588]] commandment [[G1785]] is [[G1510]] the [[G3588]] message [[G3056]] you have heard. [[G191]]

###### 8
Then again, [[G3825]] I am also writing [[G1125]] you [[G4771]] a new [[G2537]] commandment, [[G1785]] which [[G3739]] is [[G1510]] TRUE [[G227]] in [[G1722]] Him [[G846]] and also [[G2532]] in [[G1722]] you. [[G4771]] For [[G3754]] the [[G3588]] darkness [[G4653]] is fading [[G3855]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] TRUE [[G228]] light [[G5457]] is already [[G2235]] shining. [[G5316]]

###### 9
If anyone [[G3588]] claims [[G3004]] to be [[G1510]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] light [[G5457]] [but] [[G2532]] hates [[G3404]] his [[G846]] brother, [[G80]] he is [[G1510]] still [[G2193]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] darkness. [[G4653]]

###### 10
Whoever [[G3588]] loves [[G25]] his [[G846]] brother [[G80]] remains [[G3306]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] light, [[G5457]] and [[G2532]] there is [[G1510]] no [[G3756]] cause of stumbling [[G4625]] in [[G1722]] him. [[G846]]

###### 11
But [[G1161]] whoever [[G3588]] hates [[G3404]] his [[G846]] brother [[G80]] is [[G1510]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] darkness [[G4653]] and [[G2532]] walks [[G4043]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] darkness. [[G4653]] He does not know [[G1492]] where [[G4225]] he is going, [[G5217]] because [[G3754]] the [[G3588]] darkness [[G4653]] has blinded [[G5186]] his [[G846]] eyes. [[G3788]]

###### 12
I am writing [[G1125]] to you, [[G4771]] little children, [[G5040]] because [[G3754]] [your] [[G3588]] sins [[G266]] have been forgiven [[G863]] through [[G1223]] His [[G846]] name. [[G3686]]

###### 13
I am writing [[G1125]] to you, [[G4771]] fathers, [[G3962]] because [[G3754]] you know [[G1097]] Him who [is] [[G3588]] from [[G575]] [the] beginning. [[G746]] I am writing [[G1125]] to you, [[G4771]] young men, [[G3495]] because [[G3754]] you have overcome [[G3528]] the [[G3588]] evil [one]. [[G4190]] I have written [[G1125]] to you, [[G4771]] children, [[G3813]] because [[G3754]] you know [[G1097]] the [[G3588]] Father. [[G3962]]

###### 14
I have written [[G1125]] to you, [[G4771]] fathers, [[G3962]] because [[G3754]] you know [[G1097]] Him who [is] [[G3588]] from [[G575]] [the] beginning. [[G746]] I have written [[G1125]] to you, [[G4771]] young men, [[G3495]] because [[G3754]] you are [[G1510]] strong, [[G2478]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] word [[G3056]] of God [[G2316]] abides [[G3306]] in [[G1722]] you, [[G4771]] and [[G2532]] you have overcome [[G3528]] the [[G3588]] evil [one]. [[G4190]]

###### 15
{Do} not [[G3361]] love [[G25]] the [[G3588]] world [[G2889]] [or] [[G3366]] anything [[G3588]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] world. [[G2889]] If [[G1437]] anyone [[G5100]] loves [[G25]] the [[G3588]] world, [[G2889]] the [[G3588]] love [[G26]] of the [[G3588]] Father [[G3962]] is [[G1510]] not [[G3756]] in [[G1722]] him. [[G846]]

###### 16
For [[G3754]] all [[G3956]] that [is] [[G3588]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] world— [[G2889]] the [[G3588]] desires [[G1939]] of the [[G3588]] flesh, [[G4561]] the [[G3588]] desires [[G1939]] of the [[G3588]] eyes, [[G3788]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] pride [[G212]] of [[G3588]] life— [[G979]] is [[G1510]] not [[G3756]] from [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] Father [[G3962]] but [[G235]] from [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] world. [[G2889]]

###### 17
The [[G3588]] world [[G2889]] is passing away [[G3855]] [along with] [[G2532]] its [[G846]] desires, [[G1939]] but [[G1161]] whoever [[G3588]] does [[G4160]] the [[G3588]] will [[G2307]] of God [[G2316]] remains [[G3306]] forever. [[G165]]

###### 18
Children, [[G3813]] it is [[G1510]] [the] last [[G2078]] hour; [[G5610]] and [[G2532]] just as [[G2531]] you have heard [[G191]] that [[G3754]] the antichrist [[G500]] is coming, [[G2064]] so [[G2532]] now [[G3568]] many [[G4183]] antichrists [[G500]] have appeared. [[G1096]] This is how [[G3606]] we know [[G1097]] that [[G3754]] it is [[G1510]] [the] last [[G2078]] hour. [[G5610]]

###### 19
They went out [[G1831]] from [[G1537]] us, [[G1473]] but [[G235]] they did not belong [[G1510]] to us. [[G1473]] For [[G1063]] if [[G1487]] they had belonged [[G1510]] to [[G1537]] us, [[G1473]] they would have remained [[G3306]] with [[G3326]] us. [[G1473]] But [[G235]] [their departure] [[G2443]] made it clear [[G5319]] that [[G3754]] none of them [[G3756]] belonged to [[G1510]] us. [[G1473]]

###### 20
You, [[G4771]] however, [[G2532]] have [[G2192]] [an] anointing [[G5545]] from [[G575]] the [[G3588]] Holy [One], [[G40]] and [[G2532]] all of you know the truth. [[G1492]]

###### 21
I have not written [[G1125]] you [[G4771]] because [[G3754]] you lack knowledge [[G1492]] of the [[G3588]] truth, [[G225]] but [[G235]] because [[G3754]] you have [[G1492]] it, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] because [[G3754]] no [[G3756]] lie [[G5579]] comes [[G1510]] from [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] truth. [[G225]]

###### 22
Who [[G5101]] is [[G1510]] the [[G3588]] liar, [[G5583]] if [[G1487]] [it is] not [[G3361]] the [one who] [[G3588]] denies [[G720]] that [[G3754]] Jesus [[G2424]] is [[G1510]] the [[G3588]] Christ? [[G5547]] This [[G3778]] is [[G1510]] the [[G3588]] antichrist, [[G500]] who [[G3588]] denies [[G720]] the [[G3588]] Father [[G3962]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] Son. [[G5207]]

###### 23
Whoever [[G3956]] denies [[G720]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] does not have [[G2192]] the [[G3588]] Father; [[G3962]] whoever [[G3588]] confesses [[G3670]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] has [[G2192]] the [[G3588]] Father [[G3962]] as well. [[G2532]]

###### 24
[As for] you, [[G4771]] {let} what [[G3739]] you have heard [[G191]] from [[G575]] [the] beginning [[G746]] remain [[G3306]] in [[G1722]] you. [[G4771]] If [[G1437]] [it] [[G3739]] [does], [[G3306]] you [[G4771]] will also remain [[G3306]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] and [[G2532]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] Father. [[G3962]]

###### 25
And [[G2532]] this [[G3778]] is [[G1510]] the [[G3588]] promise [[G1860]] that [[G3739]] He Himself [[G846]] [made] [[G1861]] to us: [[G1473]] eternal [[G166]] life. [[G2222]]

###### 26
I have written [[G1125]] these things [[G3778]] to you [[G4771]] about [[G4012]] those who are [[G3588]] trying to deceive [[G4105]] you. [[G4771]]

###### 27
And [[G2532]] [as for] you, [[G4771]] the [[G3588]] anointing [[G5545]] you received [[G2983]] from [[G575]] Him [[G846]] remains [[G3306]] in [[G1722]] you, [[G4771]] and [[G2532]] you do [[G2192]] not [[G3756]] need [[G5532]] anyone [[G5100]] to teach [[G1321]] you. [[G4771]] But [[G235]] just as [[G5613]] [His] [[G846]] TRUE [[G227]] and [[G2532]] genuine [[G5579]] anointing [[G5545]] teaches [[G1321]] you [[G4771]] about [[G4012]] all things, [[G3956]] [so] [[G2532]] remain [[G3306]] in [[G1722]] Him [[G846]] as [[G2531]] you [[G4771]] have been taught. [[G1321]]

###### 28
And [[G2532]] now, [[G3568]] little children, [[G5040]] remain [[G3306]] in [[G1722]] [Him], [[G846]] so that [[G2443]] when [[G1437]] He appears, [[G5319]] we may be [[G2192]] confident [[G3954]] and [[G2532]] unashamed [[G153]] before [[G575]] Him [[G846]] at [[G1722]] His [[G846]] coming. [[G3952]]

###### 29
If [[G1437]] you know [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] He is [[G1510]] righteous, [[G1342]] you also know [[G1097]] that [[G3754]] everyone [[G3956]] who [[G3588]] practices [[G4160]] righteousness [[G1343]] is born [[G1080]] of [[G1537]] Him. [[G846]]
