###### 1
Everyone [[G3956]] who [[G3588]] believes [[G4100]] that [[G3754]] Jesus [[G2424]] is [[G1510]] the [[G3588]] Christ [[G5547]] is born [[G1080]] of [[G1537]] God, [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] everyone [[G3956]] who [[G3588]] loves [[G25]] the [[G3588]] [Father] [[G1080]] also [[G2532]] loves [[G25]] the [one] [[G3588]] born [[G1080]] of [[G1537]] Him. [[G846]]

###### 2
By [[G1722]] this [[G3778]] we know [[G1097]] that [[G3754]] we love [[G25]] the [[G3588]] children [[G5043]] of God: [[G2316]] when [[G3752]] we love [[G25]] God [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] keep [[G4160]] His [[G846]] commandments. [[G1785]]

###### 3
For [[G1063]] this [[G3778]] is [[G1510]] the [[G3588]] love [[G26]] of God, [[G2316]] that [[G2443]] we keep [[G5083]] His [[G846]] commandments. [[G1785]] And [[G2532]] His [[G846]] commandments [[G1785]] are [[G1510]] not [[G3756]] burdensome, [[G926]]

###### 4
because [[G3754]] everyone [[G3956]] born [[G1080]] of [[G1537]] God [[G2316]] overcomes [[G3528]] the [[G3588]] world. [[G2889]] And [[G2532]] this [[G3778]] is [[G1510]] the [[G3588]] victory [[G3529]] that [[G3588]] has overcome [[G3528]] the [[G3588]] world: [[G2889]] our [[G1473]] faith. [[G4102]]

###### 5
Who [[G5101]] then [[G1161]] overcomes [[G3528]] the [[G3588]] world? [[G2889]] Only [[G1487]] he who [[G3588]] believes [[G4100]] that [[G3754]] Jesus [[G2424]] is [[G1510]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of God. [[G2316]]

###### 6
This [[G3778]] is [[G1510]] the [One who] [[G3588]] came [[G2064]] by [[G1223]] water [[G5204]] and [[G2532]] blood, [[G129]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ— [[G5547]] not [[G3756]] by [[G1722]] water [[G5204]] alone, [[G3440]] but [[G235]] by [[G1722]] water [[G5204]] and [[G2532]] blood. [[G129]] And [[G2532]] it is [[G1510]] the [[G3588]] Spirit [[G4151]] who [[G3588]] testifies [to this], [[G3140]] because [[G3754]] the [[G3588]] Spirit [[G4151]] is [[G1510]] the [[G3588]] truth. [[G225]]

###### 7
For [[G3754]] there are [[G1510]] three [[G5140]] that testify: [[G3140]]

###### 8
the [[G3588]] Spirit, [[G4151]] the [[G3588]] water, [[G5204]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] blood— [[G129]] and [[G2532]] [these] [[G3588]] three [[G5140]] are [[G1510]] in [[G1519]] agreement. [[G1520]]

###### 9
[Even] if [[G1487]] we accept [[G2983]] human [[G444]] testimony, [[G3141]] the [[G3588]] testimony [[G3141]] of God [[G2316]] is [[G1510]] greater. [[G3173]] For [[G3754]] this [[G3778]] is [[G1510]] the [[G3588]] testimony [[G3141]] that [[G3754]] God [[G2316]] has [given] [[G3140]] about [[G4012]] His [[G846]] Son. [[G5207]]

###### 10
Whoever [[G3588]] believes [[G4100]] in [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of God [[G2316]] has [[G2192]] [this] [[G3588]] testimony [[G3141]] within [[G1722]] him; [[G848]] whoever [[G3588]] does not believe [[G4100]] God [[G2316]] has made [[G4160]] Him [out to be] [[G846]] a liar, [[G5583]] because [[G3754]] he has not believed [[G4100]] in [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] testimony [[G3141]] God [[G2316]] has [given] [[G3140]] about [[G4012]] His [[G846]] Son. [[G5207]]

###### 11
And [[G2532]] this [[G3778]] is [[G1510]] [that] [[G3588]] testimony: [[G3141]] God [[G2316]] has given [[G1325]] us [[G1473]] eternal [[G166]] life, [[G2222]] and [[G2532]] this [[G3778]] life [[G2222]] is [[G1510]] in [[G1722]] His [[G846]] Son. [[G5207]]

###### 12
Whoever [[G3588]] has [[G2192]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] has [[G2192]] life; [[G2222]] whoever [[G3588]] does not have [[G2192]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of God [[G2316]] does not have [[G2192]] life. [[G2222]]

###### 13
I have written [[G1125]] these things [[G3778]] to you [[G4771]] who [[G3588]] believe [[G4100]] in [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] name [[G3686]] of the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of God, [[G2316]] so that [[G2443]] you may know [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] you have [[G2192]] eternal [[G166]] life. [[G2222]]

###### 14
And [[G2532]] this [[G3778]] is [[G1510]] the [[G3588]] confidence [[G3954]] that [[G3739]] we have [[G2192]] before [[G4314]] Him: [[G846]] If [[G1437]] we ask [[G154]] anything [[G5100]] according to [[G2596]] His [[G846]] will, [[G2307]] He hears [[G191]] us. [[G1473]]

###### 15
And [[G2532]] if [[G1437]] we know [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] He hears [[G191]] us [[G1473]] in whatever [[G3739]] we ask, [[G154]] we know [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] we already possess [[G2192]] what [[G3588]] we have asked [[G154]] of [[G575]] Him. [[G846]]

###### 16
If [[G1437]] anyone [[G5100]] sees [[G3708]] his [[G846]] brother [[G80]] committing [[G264]] a sin [[G266]] not [[G3361]] leading to [[G4314]] death, [[G2288]] he should ask [God], [[G154]] who will give [[G1325]] life [[G2222]] to those who [[G3588]] commit [this kind of] sin. [[G264]] There is [[G1510]] a sin [[G266]] that leads to [[G4314]] death; [[G2288]] I am not saying [[G3004]] he should ask [[G2065]] regarding [[G4012]] that [sin]. [[G1565]]

###### 17
All [[G3956]] unrighteousness [[G93]] is [[G1510]] sin, [[G266]] yet [[G2532]] there is [[G1510]] sin [[G266]] that does not lead to [[G4314]] death. [[G2288]]

###### 18
We know [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] anyone [[G3956]] born [[G1080]] of [[G1537]] God [[G2316]] does not keep on sinning; [[G264]] the [One who] [[G3588]] was born [[G1080]] of [[G1537]] God [[G2316]] protects [[G5083]] him, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] evil [one] [[G4190]] cannot touch [[G680]] him. [[G846]]

###### 19
We know [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] we are [[G1510]] of [[G1537]] God, [[G2316]] and [that] [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] whole [[G3650]] world [[G2889]] is under the power [[G2749]] of [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] evil [one]. [[G4190]]

###### 20
And [[G1161]] we know [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of God [[G2316]] has come [[G2240]] and [[G2532]] has given [[G1325]] us [[G1473]] understanding, [[G1271]] so that [[G2443]] we may know [[G1097]] Him who [is] [[G3588]] true; [[G228]] and [[G2532]] we are [[G1510]] in [[G1722]] Him who [is] [[G3588]] true— [[G228]] in [[G1722]] His [[G846]] Son [[G5207]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ. [[G5547]] He [[G3778]] is [[G1510]] the [[G3588]] TRUE [[G228]] God [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] eternal [[G166]] life. [[G2222]]

###### 21
Little children, [[G5040]] keep [[G5442]] yourselves [[G1438]] from [[G575]] idols. [[G1497]]
