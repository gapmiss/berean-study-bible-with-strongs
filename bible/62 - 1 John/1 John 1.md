### 1
That which [[G3739]] was [[G1510]] from [[G575]] [the] beginning, [[G746]] which [[G3739]] we have heard, [[G191]] which [[G3739]] we have seen [[G3708]] with [[G3588]] our own [[G1473]] eyes, [[G3788]] which [[G3739]] we have gazed upon [[G2300]] and [[G2532]] touched [with] [[G5584]] our [[G1473]] [own] [[G3588]] hands— [[G5495]] [this is ] [[G4012]] the [[G3588]] Word [[G3056]] of life. [[G2222]]

### 2
And [[G2532]] [this is] the [[G3588]] life [[G2222]] that was revealed; [[G5319]] we have seen [it] [[G3708]] and [[G2532]] testified [to it], [[G3140]] and [[G2532]] we proclaim [[G518]] to you [[G4771]] the [[G3588]] eternal [[G166]] life [[G2222]] that [[G3748]] was [[G1510]] with [[G4314]] the [[G3588]] Father [[G3962]] and [[G2532]] was revealed [[G5319]] to us. [[G1473]]

### 3
We proclaim [[G518]] to you [[G4771]] what [[G3739]] we have seen [[G3708]] and [[G2532]] heard, [[G191]] so that [[G2443]] you [[G4771]] also [[G2532]] may have [[G2192]] fellowship [[G2842]] with [[G3326]] us. [[G1473]] And [[G2532]] [this] [[G3588]] fellowship [[G2842]] of ours [[G2251]] [is] with [[G3326]] the [[G3588]] Father [[G3962]] and [[G2532]] with [[G3326]] His [[G846]] Son, [[G5207]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ. [[G5547]]

### 4
We [[G1473]] write [[G1125]] these things [[G3778]] so that [[G2443]] our [[G1473]] joy [[G5479]] may be [[G1510]] complete. [[G4137]]

### 5
And [[G2532]] this [[G3778]] is [[G1510]] the [[G3588]] message [[G31]] we have heard [[G191]] from [[G575]] Him [[G846]] and [[G2532]] announce [[G312]] to you: [[G4771]] God [[G2316]] is [[G1510]] light, [[G5457]] and [[G2532]] in [[G1722]] Him [[G846]] there is [[G1510]] no [[G3756]] darkness [[G4653]] [at all]. [[G3762]]

### 6
If [[G1437]] we say [[G2036]] we have [[G2192]] fellowship [[G2842]] with [[G3326]] Him [[G846]] yet [[G2532]] walk [[G4043]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] darkness, [[G4655]] we lie [[G5574]] and [[G2532]] {do} not [[G3756]] practice [[G4160]] the [[G3588]] truth. [[G225]]

### 7
But [[G1161]] if [[G1437]] we walk [[G4043]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] light [[G5457]] as [[G5613]] He [[G846]] is [[G1510]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] light, [[G5457]] we have [[G2192]] fellowship [[G2842]] with [[G3326]] one another, [[G240]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] blood [[G129]] of Jesus [[G2424]] His [[G846]] Son [[G5207]] cleanses [[G2511]] us [[G1473]] from [[G575]] all [[G3956]] sin. [[G266]]

### 8
If [[G1437]] we say [[G2036]] we have [[G2192]] no [[G3756]] sin, [[G266]] we deceive [[G4105]] ourselves, [[G1438]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] truth [[G225]] is [[G1510]] not [[G3756]] in [[G1722]] us. [[G1473]]

### 9
If [[G1437]] we confess [[G3670]] our [[G1473]] sins, [[G266]] He is [[G1510]] faithful [[G4103]] and [[G2532]] just [[G1342]] to [[G2443]] forgive [[G863]] us [[G1473]] [our] [[G3588]] sins [[G266]] and [[G2532]] to cleanse [[G2511]] us [[G1473]] from [[G575]] all [[G3956]] unrighteousness. [[G93]]

### 10
If [[G1437]] we say [[G2036]] we have not sinned, [[G264]] we make Him out to be [[G4160]] a liar, [[G5583]] and [[G2532]] His [[G846]] word [[G3056]] is [[G1510]] not [[G3756]] in [[G1722]] us. [[G1473]]
