###### 1
Then the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H1696]] to [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]]

###### 2
“Tell [[H1696]] the sons [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] to [[H559]] do as follows [[H3588]] with one [[H5315]] who sins [[H2398]] unintentionally [[H7684]] against any [[H3605]] of the LORD’s [[H3068]] commandments [[H4687]] and does [[H6213]] what is [[H259]] forbidden [[H3808]] by them: [[H2007]]

###### 3
If [[H518]] the anointed [[H4899]] priest [[H3548]] sins, [[H2398]] bringing guilt [[H819]] on the people, [[H5971]] he must bring [[H7126]] to the LORD [[H3068]] a young bull [[H6499]] without blemish [[H8549]] as a sin offering [[H2403]] for [[H5921]] the sin [[H2403]] he has committed. [[H2398]]

###### 4
He must bring [[H935]] the bull [[H6499]] to [[H413]] the entrance [[H6607]] of the Tent [[H168]] of Meeting [[H4150]] before [[H6440]] the LORD, [[H3068]] lay [[H5564]] his hand [[H3027]] on [[H5921]] the bull’s [[H6499]] head, [[H7218]] and slaughter [[H7819]] it [[H6499]] before [[H6440]] the LORD. [[H3068]]

###### 5
Then the anointed [[H4899]] priest [[H3548]] shall take [[H3947]] some of the bull’s [[H6499]] blood [[H1818]] and bring [[H935]] it [[H853]] into [[H413]] the Tent [[H168]] of Meeting. [[H4150]]

###### 6
The priest [[H3548]] is to dip [[H2881]] his finger [[H676]] in the blood [[H1818]] and sprinkle [[H5137]] some of [[H4480]] it [[H1818]] seven [[H7651]] times [[H6471]] before [[H6440]] the LORD, [[H3068]] in front of [[H6440]] the veil [[H6532]] of the sanctuary. [[H6944]]

###### 7
The priest [[H3548]] must then apply [[H5414]] some of [[H4480]] the blood [[H1818]] to [[H5921]] the horns [[H7161]] of the altar [[H4196]] of fragrant [[H5561]] incense [[H7004]] that is before [[H6440]] the LORD [[H3068]] in the Tent [[H168]] of Meeting. [[H4150]] And [[H853]] he is to pour out [[H8210]] the rest [[H3605]] of the bull’s [[H6499]] blood [[H1818]] at [[H413]] the base [[H3247]] of the altar [[H4196]] of burnt offering [[H5930]] at the entrance [[H6607]] to the Tent [[H168]] of Meeting. [[H4150]]

###### 8
Then [[H853]] he shall remove [[H7311]] all [[H3605]] the fat [[H2459]] from [[H4480]] the bull [[H6499]] of the sin offering: [[H2403]] the fat [[H2459]] that covers [[H3680]] the entrails, [[H7130]] all [[H3605]] the fat [[H2459]] that [[H834]] is on [[H5921]] [them], [[H7130]]

###### 9
both [[H8147]] kidneys [[H3629]] with the fat [[H2459]] that [[H834]] [is] on them [[H5921]] near [[H5921]] the loins, [[H3689]] and [[H853]] the lobe [[H3508]] of [[H5921]] the liver, [[H3516]] which he shall remove [[H5493]] with [[H5921]] the kidneys, [[H3629]]

###### 10
just as [[H834]] the fat is removed [[H7311]] from the ox [[H7794]] of the peace offering. [[H8002]] The priest [[H3548]] shall then burn [[H6999]] them on [[H5921]] the altar [[H4196]] of burnt offering. [[H5930]]

###### 11
But the hide [[H5785]] of the bull [[H6499]] and all [[H3605]] its flesh, [[H1320]] with [[H5921]] its head [[H7218]] and legs [[H3767]] and its entrails [[H7130]] and dung— [[H6569]]

###### 12
all [[H3605]] the rest of the bull— [[H6499]] he must take [[H3318]] outside [[H2351]] the camp [[H4264]] to [[H413]] a ceremonially clean [[H2889]] place, [[H4725]] where [[H413]] the ashes [[H1880]] are poured out, [[H8211]] and he must burn [[H8313]] it on [[H5921]] a wood [[H6086]] fire [[H784]] on [[H5921]] the ash [[H1880]] heap. [[H8211]]

###### 13
Now if [[H518]] the whole [[H3605]] congregation [[H5712]] of Israel [[H3478]] sins unintentionally [[H7686]] and the matter [[H1697]] escapes [[H5956]] the notice [[H5869]] of the assembly [[H6951]] so that they violate [[H6213]] any [[H259]] of the LORD’s [[H3068]] commandments [[H4687]] and incur guilt [[H816]] by doing what [[H834]] is forbidden, [[H3808]]

###### 14
when they become aware [[H3045]] of the sin [[H2403]] they have committed, [[H2398]] then the assembly [[H6951]] must bring [[H7126]] a young [[H1121]] bull [[H1241]] as a sin offering [[H2403]] and present [[H935]] it [[H853]] before [[H6440]] the Tent [[H168]] of Meeting. [[H4150]]

###### 15
The elders [[H2205]] of the congregation [[H5712]] are to lay [[H5564]] their hands [[H3027]] on [[H5921]] the bull’s [[H6499]] head [[H7218]] before [[H6440]] the LORD, [[H3068]] and it [[H6499]] shall be slaughtered [[H7819]] before [[H6440]] the LORD. [[H3068]]

###### 16
Then the anointed [[H4899]] priest [[H3548]] is to bring [[H935]] some of the bull’s [[H6499]] blood [[H1818]] into [[H413]] the Tent [[H168]] of Meeting, [[H4150]]

###### 17
and [he] [[H3548]] is to dip [[H2881]] his finger [[H676]] in [[H4480]] the blood [[H1818]] and sprinkle [[H5137]] it seven [[H7651]] times [[H6471]] before [[H6440]] the LORD [[H3068]] in front [[H6440]] of the veil. [[H6532]]

###### 18
He is also to apply [[H5414]] some of [[H4480]] the blood [[H1818]] to [[H5921]] the horns [[H7161]] of the altar [[H4196]] that [[H834]] is before [[H6440]] the LORD [[H3068]] in the Tent [[H168]] of Meeting, [[H4150]] and [[H853]] he must pour out [[H8210]] the rest [[H3605]] of the blood [[H1818]] at [[H413]] the base [[H3247]] of the altar [[H4196]] of burnt offering [[H5930]] at the entrance [[H6607]] to the Tent [[H168]] of Meeting. [[H4150]]

###### 19
And [[H853]] he is to remove [[H7311]] all [[H3605]] the fat [[H2459]] from it [[H4480]] and burn [it] [[H6999]] on the altar. [[H4196]]

###### 20
He shall offer [[H6213]] this bull [[H6499]] just as [[H834]] he did [[H6213]] the bull [[H6499]] for the sin offering; [[H2403]] in this way [[H3651]] the priest [[H3548]] will make atonement [[H3722]] on their behalf, [[H5921]] and they will be forgiven. [[H5545]]

###### 21
Then he is to take [[H3318]] the bull [[H6499]] outside [[H2351]] the camp [[H4264]] and burn [[H8313]] it, [[H853]] just as [[H834]] he burned [[H8313]] the first [[H7223]] bull. [[H6499]] It [[H1931]] is the sin offering [[H2403]] for the assembly. [[H6951]]

###### 22
When [[H834]] a leader [[H5387]] sins [[H2398]] unintentionally [[H7684]] and does [[H6213]] what [[H834]] is prohibited [[H3808]] by any [[H259]] of [[H3605]] the commandments [[H4687]] of the LORD [[H3068]] his God, [[H430]] he incurs guilt. [[H816]]

###### 23
When he becomes aware [[H3045]] of the sin [[H2403]] he has committed, [[H2398]] he must bring [[H935]] an unblemished [[H8549]] male goat [[H8163]] as his offering. [[H7133]]

###### 24
He is to lay [[H5564]] his hand [[H3027]] on [[H5921]] the head [[H7218]] of the goat [[H8163]] and slaughter [[H7819]] it at the place [[H4725]] where [[H834]] the burnt offering [[H5930]] is slaughtered [[H7819]] before [[H6440]] the LORD. [[H3068]] It [[H1931]] is a sin offering. [[H2403]]

###### 25
Then the priest [[H3548]] is to take [[H3947]] some of the blood [[H1818]] of the sin offering [[H2403]] with his finger, [[H676]] apply [[H5414]] it to [[H5921]] the horns [[H7161]] of the altar [[H4196]] of burnt offering, [[H5930]] and [[H853]] pour out [[H8210]] the rest of the blood [[H1818]] at [[H413]] the base [[H3247]] of the altar. [[H4196]]

###### 26
He must burn [[H6999]] all [[H3605]] its fat [[H2459]] on the altar, [[H4196]] like the fat [[H2459]] of the peace offerings; [[H8002]] thus the priest [[H3548]] will make atonement [[H3722]] for [[H5921]] that man’s sin, [[H2403]] and he will be forgiven. [[H5545]]

###### 27
And if [[H518]] one [[H5315]] of the common [[H776]] people [[H5971]] sins [[H2398]] unintentionally [[H7684]] and does what [[H834]] is prohibited [[H3808]] by any [[H259]] of the LORD’s [[H3068]] commandments, [[H4687]] he incurs guilt. [[H816]]

###### 28
When he becomes aware [[H3045]] of the sin [[H2403]] he has committed, [[H2398]] he is to bring [[H935]] a female [[H5347]] goat [[H8166]] without blemish [[H8549]] as his offering [[H7133]] for [[H5921]] the sin [[H2403]] that [[H834]] he has committed. [[H2398]]

###### 29
He shall lay [[H5564]] his hand [[H3027]] on [[H5921]] the head [[H7218]] of the sin offering [[H2403]] and slaughter [[H7819]] it [[H2403]] at the place [[H4725]] of the burnt offering. [[H5930]]

###### 30
Then the priest [[H3548]] is to take [[H3947]] some of its blood [[H1818]] with his finger [[H676]] and apply [[H5414]] it to [[H5921]] the horns [[H7161]] of the altar [[H4196]] of burnt offering [[H5930]] and [[H853]] pour out [[H8210]] the rest [[H3605]] of the blood [[H1818]] at [[H413]] the base [[H3247]] of the altar. [[H4196]]

###### 31
And [[H853]] he shall remove [[H5493]] all [[H3605]] the fat [[H2459]] just as [[H834]] [it] [[H2459]] is removed [[H5493]] from [[H5921]] the peace offering, [[H8002]] and the priest [[H3548]] is to burn [[H6999]] it on the altar [[H4196]] as a pleasing [[H5207]] aroma [[H7381]] to the LORD. [[H3068]] In this way the priest [[H3548]] will make atonement [[H3722]] for him, [[H5921]] and he will be forgiven. [[H5545]]

###### 32
If, however, [[H518]] he brings [[H935]] a lamb [[H3532]] as a sin offering, [[H2403]] he is to bring [[H935]] an unblemished [[H8549]] female. [[H5347]]

###### 33
And he shall lay [[H5564]] his hand [[H3027]] on [[H5921]] the head [[H7218]] of the sin offering [[H2403]] and slaughter [[H7819]] it [[H853]] as a sin offering [[H2403]] at the place [[H4725]] where [[H834]] the burnt offering [[H5930]] is slaughtered. [[H7819]]

###### 34
Then the priest [[H3548]] must take [[H3947]] some of the blood [[H1818]] of the sin offering [[H2403]] with his finger, [[H676]] apply [[H5414]] it to [[H5921]] the horns [[H7161]] of the altar [[H4196]] of burnt offering, [[H5930]] and [[H853]] pour out [[H8210]] the rest [[H3605]] of its blood [[H1818]] at [[H413]] the base [[H3247]] of the altar. [[H4196]]

###### 35
[The priest] is to remove [[H5493]] all [[H3605]] the fat, [[H2459]] just as [[H834]] the fat [[H2459]] of the lamb [[H3775]] is removed [[H5493]] from the peace offerings, [[H8002]] and [he] [[H3548]] shall burn [[H6999]] it on the altar [[H4196]] along with [[H5921]] the offerings made by fire [[H801]] to the LORD. [[H3068]] In this way the priest [[H3548]] will make atonement [[H3722]] for him [[H5921]] for [[H5921]] the sin [[H2403]] he has committed, [[H2398]] and he will be forgiven. [[H5545]]
