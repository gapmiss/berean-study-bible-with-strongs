And the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H1696]] to [[H413]] Moses [[H4872]] and Aaron, [[H175]]

###### 2
“Say [[H1696]] to [[H413]] the Israelites, [[H1121]] ‘When [[H3588]] any [[H376]] man [[H376]] has [[H1961]] a bodily [[H1320]] discharge, [[H2100]] the discharge [[H2101]] is unclean. [[H2931]]

###### 3
This [[H2063]] uncleanness [[H2932]] is [[H1961]] from his discharge, [[H2101]] whether his body [[H1320]] allows [[H7325]] the discharge {to flow} [[H2101]] or [[H176]] blocks it. [[H2856]] So his discharge [[H2101]] will bring about [[H1931]] uncleanness. [[H2932]]

###### 4
Any [[H3605]] bed [[H4904]] on [[H5921]] which [[H834]] the man with the discharge [[H2100]] lies [[H7901]] will be unclean, [[H2930]] and any [[H3605]] furniture [[H3627]] on [[H5921]] which [[H834]] he sits [[H3427]] will be unclean. [[H2930]]

###### 5
Anyone [[H376]] who [[H834]] touches [[H5060]] his bed [[H4904]] must wash [[H3526]] his clothes [[H899]] and bathe [[H7364]] with water, [[H4325]] and he will be unclean [[H2930]] until [[H5704]] evening. [[H6153]]

Whoever sits [[H3427]] on [[H5921]] furniture [[H3627]] on [[H5921]] which [[H834]] the man with the discharge [[H2100]] was sitting [[H3427]] must wash [[H3526]] his clothes [[H899]] and bathe [[H7364]] with water, [[H4325]] and he will be unclean [[H2930]] until [[H5704]] evening. [[H6153]]

###### 7

###### 8
If [[H3588]] the man with the discharge [[H2100]] spits [[H7556]] on one who is clean, [[H2889]] [that person] must wash [[H3526]] his clothes [[H899]] and bathe [[H7364]] with water, [[H4325]] and he will be unclean [[H2930]] until [[H5704]] evening. [[H6153]]

###### 9

[[H6153]]

###### 11
If the man with the discharge [[H2100]] touches [[H5060]] anyone [[H3605]] without [[H3808]] first rinsing [[H7857]] his hands [[H3027]] with water, [[H4325]] the one who was touched must wash [[H3526]] his clothes [[H899]] and bathe [[H7364]] with water, [[H4325]] and he will be unclean [[H2930]] until [[H5704]] evening. [[H6153]]

###### 12
Any clay [[H2789]] pot [[H3627]] that [[H834]] the man with the discharge [[H2100]] touches [[H5060]] must be broken, [[H7665]] and any [[H3605]] wooden [[H6086]] utensil [[H3627]] must be rinsed [[H7857]] with water. [[H4325]]

[[H2891]]

###### 14
On the eighth [[H8066]] day [[H3117]] he is to take [[H3947]] two [[H8147]] turtledoves [[H8449]] or [[H176]] two [[H8147]] young [[H1121]] pigeons, [[H3123]] come [[H935]] before [[H6440]] the LORD [[H3068]] at [[H413]] the entrance [[H6607]] to the Tent [[H168]] of Meeting, [[H4150]] and give [[H5414]] them to [[H413]] the priest.
