###### 1
Now Aaron’s [[H175]] sons [[H1121]] Nadab [[H5070]] and Abihu [[H30]] took [[H3947]] their censers, [[H4289]] put [[H5414]] fire [[H784]] in them, [[H2004]] placed [[H7760]] incense [[H7004]] on them, [[H5921]] and offered [[H7126]] unauthorized [[H2114]] fire [[H784]] before [[H6440]] the LORD, [[H3068]] contrary to [[H3808]] His command. [[H6680]]

###### 2
So fire [[H784]] came out [[H3318]] from the presence [[H6440]] of the LORD [[H3068]] and devoured [[H398]] them, [[H853]] and they died [[H4191]] before [[H6440]] the LORD. [[H3068]]

###### 3
Then Moses [[H4872]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Aaron, [[H175]] “This [[H1931]] is what [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] meant [[H1696]] when He said: [[H559]] ‘To those who come near Me [[H7138]] I will show My holiness, [[H6942]] and in [[H5921]] the sight of [[H6440]] all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] I will reveal My glory.’” [[H3513]] But Aaron [[H175]] remained silent. [[H1826]]

###### 4
Moses [[H4872]] summoned [[H7121]] Mishael [[H4332]] and Elzaphan, [[H469]] sons [[H1121]] of Aaron’s [[H175]] uncle [[H1730]] Uzziel, [[H5816]] and said [[H559]] to them, [[H413]] “Come here; [[H7126]] carry [[H5375]] the bodies of your cousins [[H251]] outside [[H2351]] the camp, [[H4264]] away from the front [[H6440]] of the sanctuary.” [[H6944]]

###### 5
So they came forward [[H7126]] and carried them, [[H5375]] still in their tunics, [[H3801]] outside [[H2351]] the camp, [[H4264]] as [[H834]] Moses [[H4872]] had directed. [[H1696]]

###### 6
Then Moses [[H4872]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Aaron [[H175]] and his sons [[H1121]] Eleazar [[H499]] and Ithamar, [[H385]] “Do not [[H408]] let your hair [[H7218]] become disheveled [[H6544]] and do not [[H3808]] tear [[H6533]] your garments, [[H899]] or else [[H3808]] you will die, [[H4191]] and the LORD will be angry [[H7107]] with [[H5921]] the whole [[H3605]] congregation. [[H5712]] But your brothers, [[H251]] the whole [[H3605]] house [[H1004]] of Israel, [[H3478]] may mourn [on account of] [[H1058]] the fire [[H8316]] that [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] has ignited. [[H8313]]

###### 7
You shall not [[H3808]] go outside [[H3318]] the entrance [[H6607]] to the Tent [[H168]] of Meeting, [[H4150]] or [[H6435]] you will die, [[H4191]] for [[H3588]] the LORD’s [[H3068]] anointing [[H4888]] oil [[H8081]] is on you.” [[H5921]] So they did [[H6213]] as Moses [[H4872]] instructed. [[H1697]]

###### 8
Then the LORD [[H3069]] said [[H1696]] to [[H413]] Aaron, [[H175]]

###### 9
“You [[H859]] and your sons [[H1121]] are not [[H408]] to drink [[H8354]] wine [[H3196]] or strong drink [[H7941]] when you enter [[H935]] the Tent [[H168]] of Meeting, [[H4150]] or else [[H3808]] you will die; [[H4191]] this is a perpetual [[H5769]] statute [[H2708]] for the generations to come. [[H1755]]

###### 10
You must distinguish [[H914]] between [[H996]] the holy [[H6944]] and the common, [[H2455]] between [[H996]] the clean [[H2889]] and the unclean, [[H2931]]

###### 11
so that you may teach [[H3384]] the Israelites [[H1121]] all [[H3605]] the statutes [[H2706]] that [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] has given [[H1696]] them [[H413]] through [[H3027]] Moses.” [[H4872]]

###### 12
And Moses [[H4872]] said [[H1696]] to [[H413]] Aaron [[H175]] and his remaining [[H3498]] sons, [[H1121]] Eleazar [[H499]] and Ithamar, [[H385]] “Take [[H3947]] the grain offering [[H4503]] that remains [[H3498]] from the offerings made by fire [[H801]] to the LORD [[H3068]] and eat it [[H398]] without leaven [[H4682]] beside [[H681]] the altar, [[H4196]] because [[H3588]] it [is] [[H1931]] most [[H6944]] holy. [[H6944]]

###### 13
You shall eat [[H398]] it in a holy [[H6918]] place, [[H4725]] because [[H3588]] it [[H1931]] is your share [[H2706]] and your sons’ share [[H1121]] of the offerings made by fire [[H801]] to the LORD; [[H3068]] for [[H3588]] this is what [[H3651]] I have been commanded. [[H6680]]

###### 14
And you [[H859]] and your sons [[H1121]] and daughters [[H1323]] may eat [[H398]] the breast [[H2373]] of the wave offering [[H8573]] and the thigh [[H7785]] of the contribution [[H8641]] in a clean [[H2889]] place, [[H4725]] because [[H3588]] these portions [[H2706]] have been assigned [[H5414]] to you and your children [[H1121]] from the peace offerings [[H8002]] of the sons [[H1121]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

###### 15
They are to bring [[H935]] the thigh [[H7785]] of the contribution [[H8641]] and the breast [[H2373]] of the wave offering, [[H8573]] together with [[H5921]] the fat portions [[H2459]] of the offerings made by fire, [[H801]] to wave [[H5130]] as a wave offering [[H8573]] before [[H6440]] the LORD. [[H3068]] It will belong permanently [[H5769]] to [[H1961]] you and your children, [[H1121]] as [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] has commanded.” [[H6680]]

###### 16
Later, [[H853]] Moses [[H4872]] searched [[H1875]] carefully [[H1875]] for the goat [[H8163]] of the sin offering, [[H2403]] and behold, [[H2009]] it had been burned up. [[H8313]] He was angry [[H7107]] with [[H5921]] Eleazar [[H499]] and Ithamar, [[H385]] Aaron’s [[H175]] surviving [[H3498]] sons, [[H1121]] and asked, [[H559]]

###### 17
“Why [[H4069]] did you not [[H3808]] eat [[H398]] the sin offering [[H2403]] in the holy [[H6944]] place? [[H4725]] For [[H3588]] it [[H1931]] is most [[H6944]] holy; [[H6944]] it was given [[H5414]] to you  to take away [[H5375]] the guilt [[H5771]] of the congregation [[H5712]] by making atonement [[H3722]] for them [[H5921]] before [[H6440]] the LORD. [[H3068]]

###### 18
Since [[H2005]] its blood [[H1818]] was not [[H3808]] brought [[H935]] inside [[H6441]] the holy [place], [[H6944]] you should have eaten [[H398]] it in the sanctuary area, [[H6944]] as [[H834]] I commanded.” [[H6680]]

###### 19
But Aaron [[H175]] replied [[H1696]] to [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] “Behold, [[H2005]] this very day [[H3117]] they presented [[H7126]] their sin offering [[H2403]] and their burnt offering [[H5930]] before [[H6440]] the LORD. [[H3068]] Since these things [[H428]] have happened to me, [[H7122]] if I had eaten [[H398]] the sin offering [[H2403]] today, [[H3117]] would it have been acceptable [[H3190]] in the LORD’s [[H3068]] sight?” [[H5869]]

###### 20
When Moses [[H4872]] heard this [explanation], [[H8085]] he was satisfied. [[H3190]]
