### 1
Then the LORD [[H3068]] called to [[H7121]] Moses [[H4872]] and spoke [[H1696]] to him [[H413]] from the Tent [[H168]] of Meeting, [[H4150]] saying, [[H559]]

### 2
“Speak [[H1696]] to [[H413]] the Israelites [[H1121]] and tell [[H559]] them, [[H413]] ‘When [[H3588]] any [[H120]] of [[H4480]] you brings [[H7126]] an offering [[H7133]] to the LORD, [[H3068]] you may bring [[H7126]] as your offering [[H7133]] an [[H4480]] animal [[H929]] from [[H4480]] the herd [[H1241]] or the flock. [[H6629]]

### 3
If [[H518]] [one’s] offering [[H7133]] is a burnt offering [[H5930]] from [[H4480]] the herd, [[H1241]] he is to offer [[H7126]] an unblemished [[H8549]] male. [[H2145]] He must bring [[H7126]] it to [[H413]] the entrance [[H6607]] of the Tent [[H168]] of Meeting [[H4150]] for its acceptance [[H7522]] before [[H6440]] the LORD. [[H3068]]

### 4
He is to lay [[H5564]] his hand [[H3027]] on [[H5921]] the head [[H7218]] of the burnt offering, [[H5930]] so it can be accepted [[H7521]] on his behalf  to make atonement [[H3722]] for him. [[H5921]]

### 5
And he shall slaughter [[H7819]] the bull [[H1241]] before [[H6440]] the LORD, [[H3068]] and Aaron’s [[H175]] sons [[H1121]] the priests [[H3548]] are to present [[H7126]] the blood [[H1818]] and sprinkle [[H2236]] it [[H1818]] on all sides [[H5439]] of [[H5921]] the altar [[H4196]] that [[H834]] is at the entrance [[H6607]] to the Tent [[H168]] of Meeting. [[H4150]]

### 6
Next, he is to skin [[H6584]] the burnt offering [[H5930]] and cut [[H5408]] it into pieces. [[H5409]]

### 7
The sons [[H1121]] of Aaron [[H175]] the priest [[H3548]] shall prepare [[H5414]] a fire [[H784]] on [[H5921]] the altar [[H4196]] and arrange [[H6186]] wood [[H6086]] on [[H5921]] the fire. [[H784]]

### 8
Then Aaron’s [[H175]] sons [[H1121]] the priests [[H3548]] are to arrange [[H6186]] the pieces, [[H5409]] including the head [[H7218]] and the fat, [[H6309]] atop [[H5921]] the burning [[H784]] wood [[H6086]] on [[H5921]] the altar. [[H4196]]

### 9
The entrails [[H7130]] and legs [[H3767]] must be washed [[H7364]] with water, [[H4325]] and the priest [[H3548]] shall burn [[H6999]] all of it [[H3605]] on the altar [[H4196]] as a burnt offering, [[H5930]] an offering made by fire, [[H801]] a pleasing [[H5207]] aroma [[H7381]] to the LORD. [[H3068]]

### 10
If, however, [[H518]] one’s offering [[H7133]] is a burnt offering [[H5930]] from [[H4480]] the flock— [[H6629]] from [[H4480]] the sheep [[H3775]] or [[H176]] goats— [[H5795]] he is to present [[H7126]] an unblemished [[H8549]] male. [[H2145]]

### 11
He shall slaughter [[H7819]] it on [[H5921]] the north [[H6828]] side [[H3409]] of the altar [[H4196]] before [[H6440]] the LORD, [[H3069]] and Aaron’s [[H175]] sons [[H1121]] the priests [[H3548]] shall sprinkle [[H2236]] its blood [[H1818]] against [[H5921]] the altar [[H4196]] on all sides. [[H5439]]

### 12
He is to cut [[H5408]] the animal into pieces, [[H5409]] and the priest [[H3548]] shall arrange [[H6186]] them, [[H853]] with [[H854]] its head [[H7218]] and fat, [[H6309]] atop [[H5921]] the burning [[H784]] wood [[H6086]] that [[H834]] [is] on [[H5921]] the altar. [[H4196]]

### 13
The entrails [[H7130]] and legs [[H3767]] must be washed [[H7364]] with water, [[H4325]] and the priest [[H3548]] shall bring [[H7126]] all of it [[H3605]] and burn [it] [[H6999]] on the altar; [[H4196]] it [[H1931]] is a burnt offering, [[H5930]] an offering made by fire, [[H801]] a pleasing [[H5207]] aroma [[H7381]] to the LORD. [[H3068]]

### 14
If, instead, [[H518]] one’s offering [[H7133]] to the LORD [[H3068]] is a burnt offering [[H5930]] of [[H4480]] birds, [[H5775]] he is to offer [[H7126]] a turtledove [[H8449]] or [[H176]] a young [[H1121]] pigeon. [[H3123]]

### 15
Then the priest [[H3548]] shall bring [[H7126]] it to [[H413]] the altar, [[H4196]] twist off [[H4454]] its head, [[H7218]] and burn [[H6999]] it on the altar; [[H4196]] its blood [[H1818]] should be drained out [[H4680]] on [[H5921]] the side [[H7023]] of the altar. [[H4196]]

### 16
Then [the priest] is to remove [[H5493]] the crop [[H4760]] with its contents [[H5133]] and throw [[H7993]] it [[H853]] to the east [[H6924]] side [[H681]] of the altar, [[H4196]] in [[H413]] the place [[H4725]] for ashes. [[H1880]]

### 17
He shall tear it open [[H8156]] by its wings [[H3671]] without [[H3808]] dividing the bird, [[H914]] [and] [[H3548]] burn [[H6999]] it [[H853]] on the altar, [[H4196]] atop [[H5921]] the burning [[H784]] wood. [[H6086]] It [[H1931]] is a burnt offering, [[H5930]] an offering made by fire, [[H801]] a pleasing [[H5207]] aroma [[H7381]] to the LORD. [[H3068]]
