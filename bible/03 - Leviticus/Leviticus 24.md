###### 1
Then the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H1696]] to [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]]

###### 2
“Command [[H6680]] the Israelites [[H1121]] to bring [[H3947]] you [[H413]] clear [[H2134]] oil [[H8081]] from pressed [[H3795]] olives [[H2132]] for the light, [[H3974]] that the lamp [[H5216]] may be kept burning [[H5927]] continually. [[H8548]]

###### 3
Outside [[H2351]] the veil [[H6532]] of the testimony [[H5715]] in the Tent [[H168]] of Meeting, [[H4150]] Aaron [[H175]] is to tend [[H6186]] it [[H853]] continually [[H8548]] before [[H6440]] the LORD [[H3068]] from evening [[H6153]] until [[H5704]] morning. [[H1242]] This is a permanent [[H5769]] statute [[H2708]] for the generations to come. [[H1755]]

###### 4
He shall tend [[H6186]] the lamps [[H5216]] on [[H5921]] the pure [gold] [[H2889]] lampstand [[H4501]] before [[H6440]] the LORD [[H3068]] continually. [[H8548]]

###### 5
You are also to take [[H3947]] fine flour [[H5560]] and bake [[H644]] twelve [[H8147]] loaves, [[H2471]] using [[H1961]] two-tenths of an ephah [[H8147]] for each [[H259]] loaf, [[H2471]]

###### 6
and set [[H7760]] them [[H853]] in two [[H8147]] rows— [[H4634]] six [[H8337]] per row— [[H4635]] on [[H5921]] the table [[H7979]] of pure gold [[H2889]] before [[H6440]] the LORD. [[H3068]]

###### 7
And you are to place [[H5414]] pure [[H2134]] frankincense [[H3828]] near [[H5921]] each row, [[H4635]] so that it may serve [[H1961]] as a memorial portion [[H234]] for the bread, [[H3899]] an offering made by fire [[H801]] to the LORD. [[H3068]]

###### 8
Every Sabbath day [[H3117]] the bread is to be set out [[H6186]] before [[H6440]] the LORD [[H3068]] on behalf of the Israelites [[H1121]] as a perpetual [[H5769]] covenant. [[H1285]]

###### 9
It belongs to [[H1961]] Aaron [[H175]] and his sons, [[H1121]] who are to eat [[H398]] it in a holy [[H6918]] place; [[H4725]] for [[H3588]] it [is] [[H1931]] to him  a most [[H6944]] holy [part] [[H6944]] of the offerings made by fire [[H801]] to the LORD— [[H3068]] [his] portion [[H2706]] forever.” [[H5769]]

###### 10
Now the son [[H1121]] of an Israelite [[H3482]] mother [[H802]] and an Egyptian [[H4713]] father [[H376]] went out [[H3318]] among [[H8432]] the Israelites, [[H1121]] and a fight broke out [[H5327]] in the camp [[H4264]] [between him] [[H1121]] and an Israelite. [[H3481]]

###### 11
The son [[H1121]] of the Israelite [[H3482]] woman [[H802]] blasphemed [[H5344]] the Name [[H8034]] and cursed. [[H7043]] So they brought [[H935]] him to [[H413]] Moses. [[H4872]] (His mother’s [[H517]] name [[H8034]] was Shelomith [[H8019]] daughter [[H1323]] of Dibri, [[H1704]] of the tribe [[H4294]] of Dan.) [[H1835]]

###### 12
They placed [[H3240]] him in custody [[H4929]] until the will [[H6310]] of the LORD [[H3069]] should be made clear [[H6567]] to them. [[H1992]]

###### 13
Then the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H1696]] to [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]]

###### 14
“Bring [[H3318]] the one who has cursed [[H7043]] outside [[H2351]] the camp, [[H4264]] and have all [[H3605]] who heard [[H8085]] him lay [[H5564]] their hands [[H3027]] on [[H5921]] his head; [[H7218]] then have the whole [[H3605]] assembly [[H5712]] stone [[H7275]] him. [[H853]]

###### 15
And you are to tell [[H1696]] the Israelites, [[H1121]] ‘If [[H3588]] anyone [[H376]] curses [[H7043]] his God, [[H430]] he shall bear the consequences [[H5375]] of his sin. [[H2399]]

###### 16
Whoever blasphemes [[H5344]] the name [[H8034]] of the LORD [[H3068]] must to be put to death; [[H4191]] the whole [[H3605]] assembly [[H5712]] surely must stone [[H7275]] him,  whether he is a foreign resident [[H1616]] or native; [[H249]] if he blasphemes [[H5344]] the Name, [[H8034]] he must be put to death. [[H4191]]

###### 17
And if [[H3588]] a man [[H376]] takes the life [[H5221]] of anyone else, [[H3605]] he must surely be put to death. [[H4191]]

###### 18
Whoever kills [[H5221]] an animal [[H929]] must make restitution— [[H7999]] life [[H5315]] for [[H8478]] life. [[H5315]]

###### 19
If [[H3588]] anyone [[H376]] injures [[H5414]] his neighbor, [[H5997]] whatever [[H834]] he has done [[H6213]] must be done [[H6213]] to him: 

###### 20
fracture [[H7667]] for [[H8478]] fracture, [[H7667]] eye [[H5869]] for [[H8478]] eye, [[H5869]] tooth [[H8127]] for [[H8478]] tooth. [[H8127]] Just as [[H834]] he injured [[H5414]] the other person, [[H120]] the same [[H3651]] must be inflicted [[H5414]] on him. 

###### 21
Whoever kills [[H5221]] an animal [[H929]] must make restitution, [[H7999]] but whoever kills [[H5221]] a man [[H120]] must be put to death. [[H4191]]

###### 22
You are to have [[H1961]] the same [[H259]] standard of law [[H4941]] for the foreign resident [[H1616]] and the native; [[H249]] for [[H3588]] I [[H589]] am the LORD [[H3068]] your God.’” [[H430]]

###### 23
Then Moses [[H4872]] spoke [[H1696]] to [[H413]] the Israelites, [[H1121]] and they took [[H3318]] the one who had cursed [[H7043]] outside [[H2351]] the camp [[H4264]] and stoned [[H7275]] him. [[H68]] So the Israelites [[H1121]] did [[H6213]] as [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] had commanded [[H6680]] Moses. [[H4872]]
