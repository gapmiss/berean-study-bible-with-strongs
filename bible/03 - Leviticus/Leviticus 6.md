###### 1
Then the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H1696]] to [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]]

###### 2
“If [[H3588]] someone [[H5315]] sins [[H2398]] and acts [[H4603]] unfaithfully [[H4604]] against the LORD [[H3068]] by deceiving [[H3584]] his neighbor [[H5997]] in regard to a deposit [[H6487]] or security [[H8667]] entrusted to him [[H3027]] or [[H176]] stolen, [[H1498]] or [[H176]] if he extorts [[H6231]] his neighbor [[H5997]]

###### 3
or [[H176]] finds [[H4672]] lost property [[H9]] and lies [[H3584]] about it  and swears [[H7650]] falsely, [[H8267]] or if he commits any such sin [[H2398]] that [[H834]] a man [[H120]] might commit— [[H6213]]

###### 4
once [[H3588]] he has sinned [[H2398]] and becomes guilty, [[H816]] he must return [[H7725]] what [[H834]] he has stolen [[H1497]] or [[H176]] taken by extortion, [[H6231]] or [[H176]] the deposit [[H6487]] entrusted [[H6487]] to him, [[H853]] or [[H176]] the lost property [[H9]] he found, [[H4672]]

###### 5
or [[H176]] anything [[H3605]] else about [[H5921]] which [[H834]] he has sworn [[H7650]] falsely. [[H8267]] He must make [[H7218]] restitution in full, [[H7999]] add [[H3254]] a fifth [[H2549]] of the value, [[H5921]] and pay it [[H5414]] to its owner [[H834]] on the day [[H3117]] [he presents] his guilt offering. [[H819]]

###### 6
Then he must bring [[H935]] to [[H413]] the priest [[H3548]] his guilt offering [[H817]] to the LORD: [[H3068]] an unblemished [[H8549]] ram [[H352]] of proper value [[H6187]] from [[H4480]] the flock. [[H6629]]

###### 7
In this way the priest [[H3548]] will make atonement [[H3722]] for him [[H5921]] before [[H6440]] the LORD, [[H3068]] and he will be forgiven [[H5545]] for [[H5921]] anything [[H259]] he may have done [[H6213]] to incur guilt.” [[H819]]

###### 8
Again the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H1696]] to [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]]

###### 9
“Command [[H6680]] Aaron [[H175]] and his sons, [[H1121]] ‘This [[H2063]] is the law [[H8451]] of the burnt offering: [[H5930]] The burnt offering [[H5930]] is to remain [[H5921]] on [[H5921]] the hearth [[H4169]] of the altar [[H4196]] all [[H3605]] night, [[H3915]] until [[H5704]] morning, [[H1242]] and the fire [[H784]] must be kept burning [[H3344]] on the altar. [[H4196]]

###### 10
And the priest [[H3548]] shall put on [[H3847]] his linen [[H906]] robe [[H4055]] and linen [[H906]] undergarments, [[H4370]] and he shall remove [[H7311]] from the altar [[H4196]] the ashes [[H1880]] of the burnt offering [[H5930]] that the fire [[H784]] has consumed [[H398]] and place [[H7760]] them beside [[H681]] [it]. [[H4196]]

###### 11
Then he must take off [[H6584]] his garments, [[H899]] put on [[H3847]] other [[H312]] clothes, [[H899]] and carry [[H3318]] the ashes [[H1880]] outside [[H2351]] the camp [[H4264]] to [[H413]] a ceremonially clean [[H2889]] place. [[H4725]]

###### 12
The fire [[H784]] on [[H5921]] the altar [[H4196]] shall be kept burning; [[H3344]] it must not [[H3808]] go out. [[H3518]] Every morning [[H1242]] the priest [[H3548]] is to add [[H1197]] wood [[H6086]] to the fire, [[H5921]] arrange [[H6186]] the burnt offering [[H5930]] on it, [[H5921]] and burn [[H6999]] the fat portions [[H2459]] of the peace offerings [[H8002]] on it. [[H5921]]

###### 13
The fire [[H784]] must be kept burning [[H3344]] on [[H5921]] the altar [[H4196]] continually; [[H8548]] it must not [[H3808]] be extinguished. [[H3518]]

###### 14
Now this [[H2063]] is the law [[H8451]] of the grain offering: [[H4503]] Aaron’s [[H175]] sons [[H1121]] shall present [[H7126]] it [[H853]] before [[H6440]] the LORD, [[H3068]] in [[H413]] front [[H6440]] of the altar. [[H4196]]

###### 15
The priest is to remove [[H7311]] a handful [[H7062]] of [[H4480]] fine flour [[H5560]] and olive oil, [[H8081]] together with all [[H3605]] the incense [[H3828]] from the grain offering, [[H4503]] and burn [[H6999]] the memorial portion [[H234]] on the altar [[H4196]] as a pleasing [[H5207]] aroma [[H7381]] to the LORD. [[H3068]]

###### 16
Aaron [[H175]] and his sons [[H1121]] are to eat [[H398]] the remainder. [[H3498]] It must be eaten [[H398]] as unleavened, [[H4682]] in a holy [[H6918]] place; [[H4725]] they are to eat [[H398]] it in the courtyard [[H2691]] of the Tent [[H168]] of Meeting. [[H4150]]

###### 17
It must not [[H3808]] be baked [[H644]] with yeast; [[H2557]] I have assigned [[H5414]] it as their portion [[H2506]] of My offerings made by fire. [[H801]] It [is] [[H1931]] most [[H6944]] holy, [[H6944]] like the sin offering [[H2403]] and the guilt offering. [[H817]]

###### 18
Any [[H3605]] male [[H2145]] among the sons [[H1121]] of Aaron [[H175]] may eat it. [[H398]] This is a permanent [[H5769]] portion [[H2706]] from the offerings made by fire [[H801]] to the LORD [[H3068]] for the generations to come. [[H1755]] Anything [[H3605]] that [[H834]] touches [[H5060]] them  shall become holy.” [[H6942]]

###### 19
Then the LORD [[H3069]] said [[H1696]] to [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]]

###### 20
“This [[H2088]] is the offering [[H7133]] that Aaron [[H175]] and his sons [[H1121]] must present [[H7126]] to the LORD [[H3068]] on the day [[H3117]] he is anointed: [[H4886]] a tenth [[H6224]] of an ephah [[H374]] of fine flour [[H5560]] as a regular [[H8548]] grain offering, [[H4503]] half [[H4276]] of it in the morning [[H1242]] and half [[H4276]] in the evening. [[H6153]]

###### 21
It shall be prepared [[H6213]] with oil [[H8081]] on [[H5921]] a griddle; [[H4227]] you are to bring it [[H935]] well-kneaded [[H7246]] and present it [[H7126]] as a grain offering [[H4503]] broken [[H8601]] in pieces, [[H6595]] a pleasing [[H5207]] aroma [[H7381]] to the LORD. [[H3068]]

###### 22
The priest, [[H3548]] who is one of Aaron’s sons [[H1121]] and will be anointed [[H4899]] to take his place, [[H8478]] is to prepare it. [[H6213]] As a permanent [[H5769]] portion [[H2706]] for the LORD, [[H3068]] it must be completely [[H3632]] burned. [[H6999]]

###### 23
Every [[H3605]] grain offering [[H4503]] for a priest [[H3548]] shall be burned [[H1961]] completely; [[H3632]] it is not [[H3808]] to be eaten.” [[H398]]

###### 24
And the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H1696]] to [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]]

###### 25
“Tell [[H1696]] Aaron [[H175]] and his sons, [[H1121]] ‘This [[H2063]] is the law [[H8451]] of the sin offering: [[H2403]] In the place [[H4725]] where [[H834]] the burnt offering [[H5930]] is slaughtered, [[H7819]] the sin offering [[H2403]] shall be killed [[H7819]] before [[H6440]] the LORD; [[H3068]] it [is] most [[H6944]] holy. [[H6944]]

###### 26
The priest [[H3548]] who offers [[H2398]] it [[H853]] shall eat it; [[H398]] it must be eaten [[H398]] in a holy [[H6918]] place, [[H4725]] in the courtyard [[H2691]] of the Tent [[H168]] of Meeting. [[H4150]]

###### 27
Anything [[H3605]] that [[H834]] touches [[H5060]] its flesh [[H1320]] will become holy, [[H6942]] and if [[H834]] any of the blood [[H1818]] is spattered [[H5137]] on [[H5921]] a garment, [[H899]] you must wash [[H3526]] it [[H834]] in a holy [[H6918]] place. [[H4725]]

###### 28
The clay [[H2789]] pot [[H3627]] in which [[H834]] [the sin offering] is boiled [[H1310]] must be broken; [[H7665]] if [[H518]] it is boiled [[H1310]] in a bronze [[H5178]] pot, [[H3627]] it must be scoured [[H4838]] and rinsed [[H7857]] with water. [[H4325]]

###### 29
Any [[H3605]] male [[H2145]] among the priests [[H3548]] may eat it; [[H398]] it [is] [[H1931]] most [[H6944]] holy. [[H6944]]

###### 30
But no [[H3808]] sin offering [[H2403]] may be eaten [[H398]] if its blood [[H1818]] has been brought [[H935]] into [[H413]] the Tent [[H168]] of Meeting [[H4150]] to make atonement [[H3722]] in the Holy Place; [[H6944]] it must be burned. [[H8313]]
