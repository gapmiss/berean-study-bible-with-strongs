### 1
When [[H3588]] anyone [[H5315]] brings [[H7126]] a grain offering [[H7133]] to the LORD, [[H3068]] his offering [[H7133]] must consist of fine flour. [[H5560]] He is to pour [[H3332]] olive oil [[H8081]] on it, [[H5921]] put [[H5414]] frankincense [[H3828]] on it, [[H5921]]

### 2
and bring [[H935]] it to [[H413]] Aaron’s [[H175]] sons [[H1121]] the priests. [[H3548]] The priest [[H3548]] shall take a handful [[H7061]] of the flour [[H5560]] and oil, [[H8081]] together with [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] the frankincense, [[H3828]] and burn this [[H6999]] as a memorial portion [[H234]] on the altar, [[H4196]] an offering made by fire, [[H801]] a pleasing [[H5207]] aroma [[H7381]] to the LORD. [[H3068]]

### 3
The remainder [[H3498]] of [[H4480]] the grain offering [[H4503]] will belong to Aaron [[H175]] and his sons; [[H1121]] it is a most [[H6944]] holy part [[H6944]] of the offerings made by fire [[H801]] to the LORD. [[H3068]]

### 4
Now if [[H3588]] you bring [[H7126]] an offering of grain [[H7133]] baked [[H3989]] in an oven, [[H8574]] it must consist of fine flour, [[H5560]] either unleavened [[H4682]] cakes [[H2471]] mixed [[H1101]] with oil [[H8081]] or unleavened [[H4682]] wafers [[H7550]] coated [[H4886]] with oil. [[H8081]]

### 5
If [[H518]] your offering [[H7133]] is a grain offering [[H4503]] prepared on [[H5921]] a griddle, [[H4227]] it must be [[H1961]] unleavened bread [[H4682]] made of fine flour [[H5560]] mixed [[H1101]] with oil. [[H8081]]

### 6
Crumble it [[H6626]] and pour [[H3332]] oil [[H8081]] on it; [[H5921]] it [[H1931]] is a grain offering. [[H4503]]

### 7
If [[H518]] your offering [[H7133]] is a grain offering [[H4503]] cooked in a pan, [[H4802]] it must consist [[H6213]] of fine flour [[H5560]] with oil. [[H8081]]

### 8
When you bring [[H935]] to the LORD [[H3068]] the grain offering [[H4503]] made [[H6213]] in any of these ways, [[H428]] it is to be presented [[H7126]] to [[H413]] the priest, [[H3548]] and he shall take [[H5066]] it to [[H413]] the altar. [[H4196]]

### 9
The priest [[H3548]] is to remove [[H7311]] the memorial portion [[H234]] from [[H4480]] the grain offering [[H4503]] and burn [[H6999]] it on the altar [[H4196]] as an offering made by fire, [[H801]] a pleasing [[H5207]] aroma [[H7381]] to the LORD. [[H3068]]

### 10
But the remainder [[H3498]] of [[H4480]] the grain offering [[H4503]] shall belong to Aaron [[H175]] and his sons; [[H1121]] it is a most [[H6944]] holy [[H6944]] part of the offerings made by fire [[H801]] to the LORD. [[H3069]]

### 11
No [[H3605]] grain offering [[H4503]] that [[H834]] you present [[H7126]] to the LORD [[H3068]] may be made [[H6213]] with yeast, [[H2557]] for [[H3588]] you are not [[H3808]] to burn [[H6999]] any [[H3605]] yeast [[H7603]] or honey [[H1706]] as an offering made by fire [[H801]] to the LORD. [[H3068]]

### 12
You may bring [[H7126]] them to the LORD [[H3068]] as an offering [[H7133]] of firstfruits, [[H7225]] but they are not [[H3808]] to be offered [[H5927]] on [[H413]] the altar [[H4196]] as a pleasing [[H5207]] aroma. [[H7381]]

### 13
And you shall season [[H4414]] each [[H3605]] of your grain offerings [[H7133]] with salt; [[H4417]] you must not [[H3808]] leave [[H7673]] the salt [[H4417]] of the covenant [[H1285]] of your God [[H430]] out of [[H5921]] your grain offering— [[H4503]] you are to add [[H7126]] salt [[H4417]] to [[H5921]] each [[H3605]] of your offerings. [[H7133]]

### 14
If [[H518]] you bring [[H7126]] a grain offering [[H4503]] of firstfruits [[H1061]] to the LORD, [[H3068]] you shall offer [[H7126]] crushed [[H1643]] heads of new grain [[H24]] roasted [[H7033]] on the fire. [[H784]]

### 15
And you are to put [[H5414]] oil [[H8081]] and frankincense [[H3828]] on it; [[H5921]] it [[H1931]] is a grain offering. [[H4503]]

### 16
The priest [[H3548]] shall then burn [[H6999]] the memorial portion [[H234]] of the crushed grain [[H1643]] and the oil, [[H8081]] together with [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] its incense, [[H3828]] as an offering made by fire [[H801]] to the LORD. [[H3068]]
