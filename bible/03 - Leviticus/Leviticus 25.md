###### 1
Then the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H1696]] to [[H413]] Moses [[H4872]] on Mount [[H2022]] Sinai, [[H5514]]

###### 2
“Speak [[H1696]] to [[H413]] the Israelites [[H1121]] and say, [[H559]] ‘When [[H3588]] you enter [[H935]] the land [[H776]] I [[H589]] am giving [[H5414]] you,  the land itself [[H776]] must observe [[H7673]] a Sabbath [[H7676]] to the LORD. [[H3068]]

###### 3
For six [[H8337]] years [[H8141]] you may sow [[H2232]] your field [[H7704]] and prune [[H2168]] your vineyard [[H3754]] and gather [[H622]] its crops. [[H8393]]

###### 4
But in the seventh [[H7637]] year [[H8141]] {there shall} be [[H1961]] a Sabbath [[H7676]] of complete rest [[H7677]] for the land— [[H776]] a Sabbath [[H7676]] to the LORD. [[H3068]] You are not [[H3808]] to sow [[H2232]] your field [[H7704]] or prune [[H2168]] your vineyard. [[H3754]]

###### 5
You are not [[H3808]] to reap [[H7114]] the aftergrowth [[H5599]] of your harvest [[H7105]] or gather [[H1219]] the grapes [[H6025]] of your untended vines. [[H5139]] The land [[H776]] must have [[H1961]] a year [[H8141]] of complete rest. [[H7677]]

###### 6
Whatever the land [[H776]] yields  during the Sabbath year [[H7676]] shall be [[H1961]] food for you— [[H402]] for yourself,  your manservant [[H5650]] and maidservant, [[H519]] the hired hand [[H7916]] or foreigner [[H8453]] who stays [[H1481]] with you, [[H5973]]

###### 7
and for your livestock [[H929]] and the wild animals [[H2416]] in your land. [[H776]] All [[H3605]] of its growth [[H8393]] may serve [[H1961]] as food. [[H398]]

###### 8
And you  shall count off [[H5608]] seven [[H7651]] sabbaths [[H7676]] of years— [[H8141]] seven [[H7651]] times [[H6471]] seven [[H7651]] years— [[H8141]] so that time [[H3117]] of the seven [[H7651]] sabbatical [[H7676]] years [[H8141]] amounts to forty-nine [[H705]] years. [[H8141]]

###### 9
Then you are to sound [[H5674]] the trumpet [[H7782]] far and wide [[H8643]] on the tenth day [[H6218]] of the seventh [[H7637]] month, [[H2320]] on the Day [[H3117]] of Atonement. [[H3725]] You shall sound [[H5674]] [it] [[H7782]] throughout [[H3605]] your land. [[H776]]

###### 10
So you are to consecrate [[H6942]] the fiftieth [[H2572]] year [[H8141]] and proclaim [[H7121]] liberty [[H1865]] in the land [[H776]] for all [[H3605]] its inhabitants. [[H3427]] It [[H1931]] shall be [[H1961]] your  Jubilee, [[H3104]] when each [[H376]] of you is to return [[H7725]] to [[H413]] his property [[H272]] [and] [[H376]] to [[H413]] his clan. [[H4940]]

###### 11
The fiftieth [[H2572]] year [[H8141]] will be [[H1961]] a jubilee [[H3104]] for you;  you are not [[H3808]] to sow [[H2232]] or [[H3808]] reap [[H7114]] what grows by itself [[H5599]] or harvest [[H1219]] the untended vines. [[H5139]]

###### 12
For [[H3588]] it [is] [[H1931]] a jubilee; [[H3104]] it shall be [[H1961]] holy [[H6944]] to you.  You may eat only [[H398]] the crops taken [[H8393]] directly from [[H4480]] the field. [[H7704]]

###### 13
In this [[H2063]] Year [[H8141]] of Jubilee, [[H3104]] each [[H376]] of you shall return [[H7725]] to [[H413]] his own property. [[H272]]

###### 14
If [[H3588]] you make a sale [[H4376]] to your neighbor [[H5997]] or [[H176]] a purchase [[H7069]] from [[H3027]] him, [[H5997]] you must not [[H408]] take advantage [[H3238]] of one [[H376]] another. [[H251]]

###### 15
You are to buy [[H7069]] from [[H853]] your neighbor [[H5997]] according to the number [[H4557]] of years [[H8141]] since [[H310]] the last Jubilee; [[H3104]] he is to sell [[H4376]] to you  according to the number [[H4557]] of harvest [[H8393]] years {remaining}. [[H8141]]

###### 16
In proportion [[H6310]] to a greater number [[H7230]] of years [[H8141]] you shall increase [[H7235]] the price, [[H4736]] or decrease [[H4591]] [it] [[H4736]] in proportion to [[H6310]] a lesser [[H4591]] number of years; [[H8141]] for [[H3588]] he [[H1931]] is selling [[H4376]] you  a given number of [[H4557]] harvests. [[H8393]]

###### 17
Do not [[H3808]] take advantage [[H3238]] of one [[H376]] another, [[H5997]] but fear [[H3372]] your God; [[H430]] for [[H3588]] I [[H589]] am the LORD [[H3068]] your God. [[H430]]

###### 18
You are to keep [[H6213]] My statutes [[H2708]] and [[H853]] carefully [[H8104]] observe [[H6213]] My judgments, [[H4941]] so that you may dwell [[H3427]] securely [[H983]] in [[H5921]] the land. [[H776]]

###### 19
Then the land [[H776]] will yield [[H5414]] its fruit, [[H6529]] so that you can eat [[H398]] your fill [[H7648]] and dwell [[H3427]] in safety [[H983]] in the land. [[H5921]]

###### 20
Now [[H3588]] you may wonder, [[H559]] ‘What [[H4100]] will we eat [[H398]] in the seventh [[H7637]] year [[H8141]] if [[H2005]] we do not [[H3808]] sow [[H2232]] or gather [[H622]] our produce?’ [[H8393]]

###### 21
But I will send [[H6680]] My blessing [[H1293]] upon you  in the sixth [[H8345]] year, [[H8141]] so that [the land] will yield [[H6213]] a crop [[H8393]] sufficient for three [[H7969]] years. [[H8141]]

###### 22
While you are sowing [[H2232]] in the eighth [[H8066]] year, [[H8141]] you will be eating [[H398]] from [[H4480]] the previous [[H3465]] harvest [[H8393]] until [[H5704]] the ninth [[H8671]] year, [[H8141]] when [[H5704]] its harvest [[H8393]] comes in. [[H935]]

###### 23
The land [[H776]] must not [[H3808]] be sold [[H4376]] permanently, [[H6783]] because [[H3588]] it is Mine, [[H776]] and [[H3588]] you [[H859]] are but foreigners [[H1616]] and sojourners [[H8453]] with Me. [[H5978]]

###### 24
Thus for every [[H3605]] piece of property [[H776]] you possess, [[H272]] you must provide for [[H5414]] the redemption [[H1353]] of the land. [[H776]]

###### 25
If [[H3588]] your brother [[H251]] becomes impoverished [[H4134]] and sells [[H4376]] some of his property, [[H272]] his nearest [[H7138]] of kin [[H1350]] may come [[H935]] and redeem [[H1350]] what his brother [[H251]] has sold. [[H4465]]

###### 26
Or if [[H3588]] a man [[H376]] has [[H1961]] no one [[H3808]] to redeem it [[H1350]] for him,  but he prospers [[H5381]] and acquires [[H4672]] enough [[H1767]] to redeem his land, [[H1353]]

###### 27
he shall calculate [[H2803]] the years [[H8141]] since its sale, [[H4465]] repay [[H7725]] the balance [[H5736]] to the man [[H376]] to  whom [[H834]] he sold it, [[H4376]] and return [[H7725]] to his property. [[H272]]

###### 28
But if [[H518]] he cannot [[H3808]] obtain [[H4672]] enough [[H1767]] to repay [[H7725]] him,  what he sold [[H4465]] will remain [[H1961]] in possession [[H3027]] of the buyer [[H7069]] until [[H5704]] the Year [[H8141]] of Jubilee. [[H3104]] In the Jubilee, [[H3104]] however, it is to be released, [[H3318]] so that he may return [[H7725]] to his property. [[H272]]

###### 29
If [[H3588]] a man [[H376]] sells [[H4376]] a house [[H1004]] in a walled [[H2346]] city, [[H5892]] he retains [[H1961]] his right of redemption [[H1353]] until [[H5704]] a full [[H8537]] year [[H8141]] after its sale; [[H4465]] during that year [[H3117]] it may be [[H1961]] redeemed. [[H1353]]

###### 30
If [[H518]] it is not [[H3808]] redeemed [[H1350]] by the end [[H5704]] of a full [[H8549]] year, [[H8141]] then the house [[H1004]] in the walled [[H2346]] city [[H5892]] is permanently [[H6783]] transferred to its buyer [[H7069]] and his descendants. [[H1755]] It is not [[H3808]] to be released [[H3318]] in the Jubilee. [[H3104]]

###### 31
But houses [[H1004]] in villages [[H2691]] with [[H834]] no [[H369]] walls [[H2346]] around them [[H5439]] are considered [[H2803]] as open fields. [[H7704]] They may be redeemed, [[H1353]] and they shall be [[H1961]] released [[H3318]] in the Jubilee. [[H3104]]

###### 32
As for the cities [[H5892]] of the Levites, [[H3881]] the Levites [[H3881]] always [[H5769]] have [[H1961]] the right to redeem [[H1353]] their houses [[H1004]] in the cities [[H5892]] they possess. [[H272]]

###### 33
So whatever [[H834]] belongs to [[H4480]] the Levites [[H3881]] may be redeemed— [[H1350]] a house [[H1004]] sold [[H4465]] in a city [[H5892]] they possess— [[H272]] and must be released [[H3318]] in the Jubilee, [[H3104]] because [[H3588]] the houses [[H1004]] in the cities [[H5892]] of the Levites [[H3881]] are their possession [[H272]] among [[H8432]] the Israelites. [[H1121]]

###### 34
But the open fields [[H7704]] around their cities [[H5892]] may not [[H3808]] be sold, [[H4376]] for [[H3588]] this [[H1931]] is their permanent [[H5769]] possession. [[H272]]

###### 35
Now if [[H3588]] your countryman [[H251]] becomes destitute [[H4134]] and cannot support [[H4131]] himself among you, [[H5973]] you are to help [[H2388]] him  like a foreigner [[H1616]] or temporary resident, [[H8453]] so that he can continue to live [[H2421]] among you. [[H5973]]

###### 36
Do not [[H408]] take [[H3947]] any interest [[H5392]] or profit [[H8635]] from him, [[H853]] but fear [[H3372]] your God, [[H430]] that your countryman [[H251]] may live [[H2421]] among you. [[H5973]]

###### 37
You must not [[H3808]] lend [[H5414]] him [[H853]] your silver [[H3701]] with interest [[H5392]] or [[H3808]] sell [[H5414]] him your food [[H400]] for profit. [[H4768]]

###### 38
I [[H589]] am the LORD [[H3068]] your God, [[H430]] who [[H834]] brought you out [[H3318]] of Egypt [[H4714]] to give [[H5414]] you the land [[H776]] of Canaan [[H3667]] and to be [[H1961]] your God. [[H430]]

###### 39
If [[H3588]] a countryman [[H251]] among you [[H5973]] becomes destitute [[H4134]] and sells himself [[H4376]] to you,  you must not [[H3808]] force [[H5647]] him into  slave [[H5650]] labor. [[H5656]]

###### 40
Let him stay [[H1961]] with you [[H5973]] as a hired worker [[H7916]] or temporary resident; [[H8453]] he is to work [[H5647]] for [[H5973]] you until [[H5704]] the Year [[H8141]] of Jubilee. [[H3104]]

###### 41
Then he [[H1931]] and his children [[H1121]] are to be released, [[H3318]] and he may return [[H7725]] to [[H413]] his clan [[H4940]] and to [[H413]] the property [[H272]] of his fathers. [[H1]]

###### 42
Because [[H3588]] [the Israelites are] [[H1992]] My servants, [[H5650]] whom [[H834]] I brought out [[H3318]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] they are not [[H3808]] to be sold [[H4376]] as slaves. [[H5650]]

###### 43
You are not [[H3808]] to rule [[H7287]] over them harshly, [[H6531]] but you shall fear [[H3372]] your God. [[H430]]

###### 44
Your male [[H5650]] and female slaves [[H519]] shall come [[H1961]] from [[H853]] the nations [[H1471]] around you; [[H5439]] from them [[H1992]] you may purchase [[H7069]] slaves. [[H5650]]

###### 45
You may also [[H1571]] purchase them [[H7069]] from the [[H1121]] foreigners [[H8453]] residing [[H1481]] among you [[H5973]] or their clans [[H4940]] living among you [[H5973]] who [[H834]] are born [[H3205]] in your land. [[H776]] These may become [[H1961]] your  property. [[H272]]

###### 46
You may leave [[H5157]] them [[H853]] to your sons [[H1121]] after [[H310]] you to inherit [[H3423]] as property; [[H272]] you can make them slaves [[H5647]] for life. [[H5769]] But as for your brothers, [[H251]] the Israelites, [[H1121]] no [[H3808]] man [[H376]] may rule [[H7287]] harshly [[H6531]] over his brother. [[H251]]

###### 47
If [[H3588]] a foreigner [[H1616]] or temporary resident [[H8453]] living among [[H5973]] you prospers, [[H5381]] but your brother [[H251]] dwelling near him [[H5973]] becomes poor [[H4134]] and sells himself [[H4376]] to the foreigner [[H1616]] or [[H176]] to a member [[H6133]] of [his] [[H1616]] clan, [[H4940]]

###### 48
he retains [[H1961]] the right of redemption [[H1353]] after [[H310]] he has sold himself. [[H4376]] One [[H259]] of his brothers [[H251]] may redeem him: [[H1350]]

###### 49
either [[H176]] his uncle [[H1730]] or [[H176]] cousin, [[H1121]] or [[H176]] any close relative [[H7607]] from his clan, [[H4940]] may redeem him. [[H1350]] Or if [[H176]] he prospers, [[H5381]] he may redeem himself. [[H1350]]

###### 50
He and [[H5973]] his purchaser [[H7069]] will then count the time [[H2803]] from the year [[H8141]] he sold [[H4376]] himself  up to [[H5704]] the Year [[H8141]] of Jubilee. [[H3104]] The price [[H3701]] of his sale [[H4465]] will be [[H1961]] determined by the number [[H4557]] of years, [[H8141]] based on [[H1961]] the daily [[H3117]] wages of a hired hand. [[H7916]]

###### 51
If [[H518]] many [[H7227]] years [[H8141]] remain, [[H5750]] he must pay [[H7725]] for his redemption [[H1353]] in proportion to [[H6310]] his purchase [[H4736]] price. [[H3701]]

###### 52
If [[H518]] only a few [[H4592]] years [[H8141]] remain [[H7604]] until [[H5704]] the Year [[H8141]] of Jubilee, [[H3104]] he is to calculate [[H2803]] and pay [[H7725]] his redemption [[H1353]] according to [[H6310]] his remaining years. [[H8141]]

###### 53
Like a man hired [[H7916]] from year [[H8141]] to year, [[H8141]] he will stay [[H1961]] with him, [[H5973]] but a foreign owner must not [[H3808]] rule [[H7287]] over him harshly [[H6531]] in your sight. [[H5869]]

###### 54
Even if [[H518]] he is not [[H3808]] redeemed [[H1350]] in any of these ways, [[H428]] he [[H1931]] and his children [[H1121]] shall be released [[H3318]] in the Year [[H8141]] of Jubilee. [[H3104]]

###### 55
For [[H3588]] the Israelites [[H1121]] are My servants. [[H5650]] They [[H1992]] are My servants, [[H5650]] whom [[H834]] I brought out [[H3318]] of Egypt. [[H4714]] I [[H589]] am the LORD [[H3068]] your God. [[H430]]
