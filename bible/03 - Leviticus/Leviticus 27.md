### 1
Then the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H1696]] to [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]]

### 2
“Speak [[H1696]] to [[H413]] the Israelites [[H1121]] and say [[H559]] to them, [[H413]] ‘When [[H3588]] someone [[H376]] makes a special [[H6381]] vow [[H5088]] to the LORD [[H3068]] involving the value [[H6187]] of persons, [[H5315]]

### 3
if the valuation [[H6187]] concerns [[H1961]] a male [[H2145]] from twenty [[H6242]] to [[H5704]] sixty [[H8346]] years of age, [[H8141]] then your valuation [[H6187]] shall be [[H1961]] fifty [[H2572]] silver [[H3701]] shekels, [[H8255]] according to the sanctuary [[H6944]] shekel. [[H8255]]

### 4
Or if [[H518]] it [[H1931]] is a female, [[H5347]] then your valuation [[H6187]] shall be [[H1961]] thirty [[H7970]] shekels. [[H8255]]

### 5
And if [the person is] [[H518]] from five [[H2568]] to [[H5704]] twenty [[H6242]] years of age, [[H1121]] then your valuation [[H6187]] for the male [[H2145]] shall be [[H1961]] twenty [[H6242]] shekels, [[H8255]] and for the female [[H5347]] ten [[H6235]] shekels. [[H8255]]

### 6
Now if [the person is] [[H518]] one month [[H2320]] to [[H5704]] five [[H2568]] years of age, [[H8141]] then your valuation [[H6187]] for the male [[H2145]] shall be [[H1961]] five [[H2568]] shekels [[H8255]] of silver, [[H3701]] and for the female [[H5347]] three [[H7969]] shekels [[H8255]] of silver. [[H3701]]

### 7
And if [the person is] [[H518]] sixty [[H8346]] years of age [[H8141]] or older, [[H4605]] then your valuation [[H6187]] shall be [[H1961]] fifteen [[H2568]] shekels [[H8255]] for the male [[H2145]] and ten [[H6235]] shekels [[H8255]] and for the female. [[H5347]]

### 8
But if [[H518]] he [[H1931]] is poorer [[H4134]] than your valuation, [[H6187]] he is to present [[H5975]] the person before [[H6440]] the priest, [[H3548]] and the priest [[H3548]] shall set a value [[H6186]] for him. [[H853]] The priest [[H3548]] will set a value [[H6186]] according to [[H5921]] what [[H834]] the one making the vow [[H5087]] can afford. [[H5381]]

### 9
If [he vows] [[H518]] an [[H4480]] animal [[H929]] that [[H834]] may be brought [[H7126]] as an offering [[H7133]] to the LORD, [[H3068]] any [[H3605]] of these [[H4480]] that [[H834]] he gives [[H5414]] to the LORD [[H3068]] will be [[H1961]] holy. [[H6944]]

### 10
He must not [[H3808]] replace it [[H2498]] or exchange it, [[H4171]] either good [[H2896]] for bad [[H7451]] or [[H176]] bad [[H7451]] for good. [[H2896]] But if [[H518]] he does substitute [[H4171]] one animal [[H929]] for another, [[H929]] both that animal [[H1931]] and its substitute [[H8545]] will be [[H1961]] holy. [[H6944]]

### 11
But if [[H518]] the vow involves any [[H3605]] of the unclean [[H2931]] animals [[H929]] that [[H834]] may not [[H3808]] be brought [[H7126]] as an offering [[H7133]] to the LORD, [[H3068]] the animal [[H929]] must be presented [[H5975]] before [[H6440]] the priest. [[H3548]]

### 12
The priest [[H3548]] shall set its value, [[H6186]] whether high [[H2896]] or low; [[H7451]] as the priest [[H3548]] values it, [[H6187]] the price [[H3651]] will be set. [[H1961]]

### 13
But if [the owner] [[H518]] ever decides to redeem [the animal], [[H1350]] he must add [[H3254]] a fifth [[H2549]] to [[H5921]] the value. [[H6187]]

### 14
Now if [[H3588]] a man [[H376]] consecrates [[H6942]] his house [[H1004]] as holy [[H6944]] to the LORD, [[H3068]] then the priest [[H3548]] shall value it [[H6186]] either as [[H996]] good [[H2896]] or [[H996]] bad. [[H7451]] The price will stand [[H6965]] just as [[H834]] the priest [[H3548]] values [[H6186]] it. [[H853]]

### 15
But if [[H518]] he who consecrated [[H6942]] his house [[H1004]] redeems [[H1350]] it, [[H853]] he must add [[H3254]] a fifth [[H2549]] to [[H5921]] the assessed [[H6187]] value, [[H3701]] and it will belong [[H1961]] to him. 

### 16
If [[H518]] a man [[H376]] consecrates [[H6942]] to the LORD [[H3068]] a parcel [[H7704]] of his land, [[H272]] then your valuation [[H6187]] shall be [[H1961]] proportionate [[H6310]] to the seed required for it— [[H2233]] fifty [[H2572]] shekels [[H8255]] of silver [[H3701]] for every homer [[H2563]] of barley [[H8184]] seed. [[H2233]]

### 17
If [[H518]] he consecrates [[H6942]] his field [[H7704]] during the Year [[H8141]] of Jubilee, [[H3104]] the price will stand [[H6965]] according to your valuation. [[H6187]]

### 18
But if [[H518]] he consecrates [[H6942]] his field [[H7704]] after [[H310]] the Jubilee, [[H3104]] the priest [[H3548]] is to calculate [[H2803]] the price [[H3701]] in proportion to [[H5921]] the years [[H8141]] left [[H3498]] until [[H5704]] the next Year [[H8141]] of Jubilee, [[H3104]] so that your valuation [[H6187]] will be reduced. [[H1639]]

### 19
And if [[H518]] the one who consecrated [[H6942]] the field [[H7704]] decides to redeem [[H1350]] it, [[H1350]] he must add [[H3254]] a fifth [[H2549]] to [[H5921]] the assessed [[H6187]] value, [[H3701]] and it shall belong [[H6965]] to him. 

### 20
If, however, [[H518]] he does not [[H3808]] redeem [[H1350]] the field, [[H7704]] or if [[H518]] he has sold [[H4376]] it [[H7704]] to another [[H312]] man, [[H376]] it may no [[H3808]] longer [[H5750]] be redeemed. [[H1350]]

### 21
When the field [[H7704]] is released [[H3318]] in the Jubilee, [[H3104]] it will become [[H1961]] holy, [[H6944]] like a field [[H7704]] devoted [[H2764]] to the LORD; [[H3068]] it becomes [[H1961]] the property [[H272]] of the priests. [[H3548]]

### 22
Now if [[H518]] he consecrates [[H6942]] to the LORD [[H3068]] a field [[H7704]] he has purchased, [[H4736]] which [[H834]] is not [[H3808]] a part [[H7704]] of his own property, [[H272]]

### 23
then the priest [[H3548]] shall calculate [[H2803]] for him the value [[H4373]] up to [[H5704]] the Year [[H8141]] of Jubilee, [[H3104]] and [the man] shall pay [[H5414]] the assessed value [[H6187]] on that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] as a sacred offering [[H6944]] to the LORD. [[H3068]]

### 24
In the Year [[H8141]] of Jubilee [[H3104]] the field [[H7704]] shall return [[H7725]] to the one from whom [[H834]] it was bought— [[H7069]] the original owner [[H272]] of the land. [[H776]]

### 25
Every [[H3605]] valuation [[H6187]] will be [[H1961]] according to the sanctuary [[H6944]] shekel, [[H8255]] twenty [[H6242]] gerahs [[H1626]] to the shekel. [[H8255]]

### 26
But [[H389]] no [[H3808]] one [[H376]] may consecrate [[H6942]] a firstborn [[H1060]] of the livestock, [[H929]] because [[H834]] a firstborn [[H1069]] belongs to the LORD. [[H3068]] Whether [[H518]] an animal from the herd [[H7794]] or [[H518]] flock, [[H7716]] it [is] [[H1931]] the LORD’s. [[H3068]]

### 27
But if [[H518]] [it is] among the unclean [[H2931]] animals, [[H929]] then he may redeem [[H6299]] it according to your valuation [[H6187]] and add [[H3254]] a fifth [[H2549]] of its value. [[H5921]] If [[H518]] it is not [[H3808]] redeemed, [[H1350]] then it shall be sold [[H4376]] according to your valuation. [[H6187]]

### 28
Nothing [[H3605]] that [[H834]] a man [[H376]] sets apart [[H2764]] to the LORD [[H3069]] from all he owns— [[H3605]] whether a man, [[H120]] an animal, [[H929]] or his inherited land— [[H7704]] can be sold [[H4376]] or redeemed; [[H1350]] everything [[H3605]] so devoted [[H2764]] [is] most [[H6944]] holy [[H6944]] to the LORD. [[H3069]]

### 29
No [[H3605]] person [[H120]] set apart for destruction [[H2763]] may be ransomed; [[H6299]] he must surely [[H4191]] be put to death. [[H4191]]

### 30
Thus any [[H3605]] the tithe [[H4643]] from the land, [[H776]] [whether] from the seed [[H2233]] of the land [[H776]] or the fruit [[H6529]] of the trees, [[H6086]] belongs to the LORD; [[H3068]] it [[H1931]] is holy [[H6944]] to the LORD. [[H3068]]

### 31
If [[H518]] a man [[H376]] wishes [[H1350]] to redeem [[H1350]] part of his tithe, [[H4643]] he must add [[H3254]] a fifth [[H2549]] to its value. [[H5921]]

### 32
Every [[H3605]] tenth [[H4643]] animal from the herd [[H1241]] or flock [[H6629]] that [[H834]] passes [[H5674]] under [[H8478]] the shepherd’s rod [[H7626]] will be [[H1961]] holy [[H6944]] to the LORD. [[H3068]]

### 33
He must not [[H3808]] inspect [[H1239]] whether it is good [[H2896]] or [[H996]] bad, [[H7451]] and he shall not [[H3808]] make any substitution. [[H4171]] But if [[H518]] he does make a substitution, [[H4171]] both the animal [[H1931]] and its substitute [[H8545]] shall become [[H1961]] holy; [[H6944]] they cannot [[H3808]] be redeemed.’” [[H1350]]

### 34
These [[H428]] are the commandments [[H4687]] that [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] gave [[H6680]] to Moses [[H4872]] for [[H413]] the Israelites [[H1121]] on Mount [[H2022]] Sinai. [[H5514]]
