[[Leviticus 4|←]] • [[Leviticus 6|→]]

---

### 1
If [[H3588]] someone [[H5315]] sins [[H2398]] by failing [[H3808]] to testify [[H5046]] when he hears [[H8085]] a public [[H6963]] charge [[H423]] about something he [[H1931]] has witnessed, [[H5707]] whether [[H176]] he has seen it [[H7200]] or [[H176]] learned of it, [[H3045]] he shall bear [[H5375]] the iniquity. [[H5771]]

### 2
Or [[H176]] if a person [[H5315]] touches [[H5060]] anything [[H3605]] unclean— [[H2931]] whether the carcass [[H5038]] of an unclean [[H2931]] wild animal [[H2416]] or [[H176]] livestock [[H929]] or [[H176]] crawling creature— [[H8318]] even if he is unaware [[H5956]] of it, [[H4480]] he [[H1931]] is unclean [[H2931]] and guilty. [[H816]]

### 3
Or [[H176]] if [[H3588]] he touches [[H5060]] human [[H120]] uncleanness— [[H2932]] anything [[H3605]] by which [[H834]] one becomes unclean— [[H2930]] even if he is unaware [[H5956]] of it, [[H4480]] when he realizes it, [[H3045]] he is guilty. [[H816]]

### 4
Or [[H176]] if [[H3588]] someone [[H5315]] swears [[H7650]] thoughtlessly [[H981]] with his lips [[H8193]] to do anything good [[H3190]] or [[H176]] evil— [[H7489]] in [[H3605]] whatever matter [[H834]] a man [[H120]] may rashly pronounce [[H981]] an oath— [[H7621]] even if he is unaware [[H5956]] of it, [[H4480]] when he [[H1931]] later realizes it, [[H3045]] he will be guilty. [[H816]]

### 5
If [[H3588]] someone incurs guilt [[H816]] in one [[H259]] of these ways, [[H428]] he must confess [[H3034]] the sin he has committed, [[H2398]]

### 6
and he must bring [[H935]] his guilt offering [[H817]] to the LORD [[H3068]] for [[H5921]] the sin [[H2403]] he has committed: [[H2398]] a female [[H5347]] lamb [[H3776]] or [[H176]] goat [[H8166]] from [[H4480]] the flock [[H6629]] as a sin offering. [[H2403]] And the priest [[H3548]] will make atonement [[H3722]] for him [[H5921]] concerning his sin. [[H2403]]

### 7
If, however, [[H518]] he cannot [[H3808]] afford [[H5060]] a lamb, [[H7716]] he may bring [[H935]] to the LORD [[H3068]] as restitution [[H817]] for his sin [[H2398]] two [[H8147]] turtledoves [[H8449]] or [[H176]] two [[H8147]] young [[H1121]] pigeons— [[H3123]] one [[H259]] as a sin offering [[H2403]] and the other [[H259]] as a burnt offering. [[H5930]]

### 8
He is to bring [[H935]] them to [[H413]] the priest, [[H3548]] who shall first [[H7223]] present [[H7126]] the one [[H834]] for the sin offering. [[H2403]] He is to twist [[H4454]] its head [[H7218]] at the front [[H4136]] of its neck [[H6203]] without [[H3808]] severing it; [[H914]]

### 9
then he is to sprinkle [[H5137]] some of the blood [[H1818]] of the sin offering [[H2403]] on [[H5921]] the side [[H7023]] of the altar, [[H4196]] while the rest [[H7604]] of the blood [[H1818]] is drained out [[H4680]] at [[H413]] the base [[H3247]] of the altar. [[H4196]] It [is] [[H1931]] a sin offering. [[H2403]]

### 10
And [[H853]] [the priest] must prepare [[H6213]] the second [bird] [[H8145]] as a burnt offering [[H5930]] according to the ordinance. [[H4941]] In this way the priest [[H3548]] will make atonement [[H3722]] for him [[H5921]] for the sin [[H2403]] he has committed, [[H2398]] and he will be forgiven. [[H5545]]

### 11
But if [[H518]] he cannot [[H3808]] afford [[H5381]] two [[H8147]] turtledoves [[H8449]] or [[H176]] two [[H8147]] young [[H1121]] pigeons, [[H3123]] he may bring [[H935]] a tenth [[H6224]] of an ephah [[H374]] of fine flour [[H5560]] as an offering for his sin. [[H2403]] He must not [[H3808]] put [[H7760]] olive oil [[H8081]] or frankincense [[H3828]] on it, [[H5921]] because [[H3588]] it [[H1931]] is a sin offering. [[H2403]]

### 12
He is to bring [[H935]] it to [[H413]] the priest, [[H3548]] who shall take [[H7061]] a handful [[H4393]] from it [[H4480]] as a memorial portion [[H234]] and burn [it] [[H6999]] on the altar [[H4196]] atop [[H5921]] the offerings made by fire [[H801]] to the LORD; [[H3068]] it [[H1931]] is a sin offering. [[H2403]]

### 13
In this way the priest [[H3548]] will make atonement [[H3722]] for him [[H5921]] for [[H5921]] any [[H259]] of these [[H428]] sins [[H2403]] he has committed, [[H2398]] and he will be forgiven. [[H5545]] The remainder will belong to [[H1961]] the priest, [[H3548]] like the grain offering.” [[H4503]]

### 14
Then the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H1696]] to [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]]

### 15
“If [[H3588]] someone [[H5315]] acts [[H4603]] unfaithfully [[H4604]] and sins [[H2398]] unintentionally [[H7684]] against [[H4480]] any of the LORD’s [[H3068]] holy things, [[H6944]] he must bring [[H935]] his guilt offering [[H817]] to the LORD: [[H3068]] an unblemished [[H8549]] ram [[H352]] from the flock, [[H6629]] of proper value [[H6187]] in silver [[H3701]] shekels [[H8255]] according to the sanctuary [[H6944]] shekel; [[H8255]] it is a guilt offering. [[H817]]

### 16
Regarding any holy thing [[H6944]] he has harmed, [[H2398]] he must make restitution [[H7999]] by adding [[H3254]] a fifth [[H2549]] of its value to it [[H5921]] and giving [[H5414]] it to the priest, [[H3548]] [who] [[H3548]] will make atonement [[H3722]] on his behalf [[H5921]] with the ram [[H352]] as a guilt offering, [[H817]] and he will be forgiven. [[H5545]]

### 17
If [[H518]] someone [[H5315]] sins [[H2398]] and violates [[H6213]] any [[H259]] of the LORD’s [[H3069]] commandments [[H4687]] even though he was [[H3808]] unaware, [[H3045]] he is still guilty [[H816]] and shall bear [[H5375]] his punishment. [[H5771]]

### 18
He must bring [[H935]] to [[H413]] the priest [[H3548]] an unblemished [[H8549]] ram [[H352]] of proper value [[H6187]] from [[H4480]] the flock [[H6629]] as a guilt offering. [[H817]] Then the priest [[H3548]] will make atonement [[H3722]] on his behalf [[H5921]] for [[H5921]] the wrong [[H7684]] he has committed [[H7683]] unintentionally, [[H3808]] and he will be forgiven. [[H5545]]

### 19
It [[H1931]] is a guilt offering; [[H817]] he was certainly guilty [[H816]] before the LORD.” [[H3068]]
