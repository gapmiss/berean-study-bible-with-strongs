###### 1
On the eighth [[H8066]] day [[H3117]] Moses [[H4872]] summoned [[H7121]] Aaron [[H175]] and his sons [[H1121]] and the elders [[H2205]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

###### 2
He said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Aaron, [[H175]] “Take [[H3947]] for yourself  a bull calf [[H5695]] for a sin offering [[H2403]] and a ram [[H352]] for a burnt offering, [[H5930]] both without blemish, [[H8549]] and present [[H7126]] them before [[H6440]] the LORD. [[H3068]]

###### 3
Then speak [[H1696]] to [[H413]] the Israelites [[H1121]] [and] say, [[H559]] ‘Take [[H3947]] a male goat [[H8163]] for a sin offering, [[H2403]] a calf [[H5695]] and a lamb, [[H3532]] both a year old [[H1121]] [and] without blemish, [[H8549]] for a burnt offering, [[H5930]]

###### 4
an ox [[H7794]] and a ram [[H352]] for a peace offering [[H8002]] to sacrifice [[H2076]] before [[H6440]] the LORD, [[H3068]] and a grain offering [[H4503]] mixed [[H1101]] with oil. [[H8081]] For [[H3588]] today [[H3117]] the LORD [[H3068]] will appear [[H7200]] to you.’” [[H413]]

###### 5
So they took [[H3947]] what [[H834]] Moses [[H4872]] had commanded [[H6680]] to [[H413]] the front [[H6440]] of the Tent [[H168]] of Meeting, [[H4150]] and the whole [[H3605]] congregation [[H5712]] drew near [[H7126]] and stood [[H5975]] before [[H6440]] the LORD. [[H3068]]

###### 6
And Moses [[H4872]] said, [[H559]] “This [[H2088]] is what [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] has commanded [[H6680]] you to do, [[H6213]] so that the glory [[H3519]] of the LORD [[H3068]] may appear [[H7200]] to you.” [[H413]]

###### 7
Then Moses [[H4872]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Aaron, [[H175]] “Approach [[H7126]] the altar [[H4196]] and sacrifice [[H6213]] your sin offering [[H2403]] and your burnt offering [[H5930]] to make atonement [[H3722]] for yourself [[H1157]] and for the people. [[H5971]] And sacrifice [[H6213]] the people’s [[H5971]] offering [[H7133]] to make atonement [[H3722]] for them, [[H1157]] as [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] has commanded. [[H6680]]

###### 8
So Aaron [[H175]] approached [[H7126]] the altar [[H4196]] and slaughtered [[H7819]] the calf [[H5695]] as a sin offering [[H2403]] for himself. 

###### 9
The sons [[H1121]] of Aaron [[H175]] brought [[H7126]] the blood [[H1818]] to him, [[H413]] and he dipped [[H2881]] his finger [[H676]] in the blood [[H1818]] and applied [[H5414]] it to [[H5921]] the horns [[H7161]] of the altar. [[H4196]] And [[H853]] he poured out [[H3332]] the rest of the blood [[H1818]] at [[H413]] the base [[H3247]] of the altar. [[H4196]]

###### 10
On the altar [[H4196]] he burned [[H6999]] the fat, [[H2459]] the kidneys, [[H3629]] and [[H853]] the lobe [[H3508]] of [[H4480]] the liver [[H3516]] from [[H4480]] the sin offering, [[H2403]] as [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] had commanded [[H6680]] Moses. [[H4872]]

###### 11
But [[H853]] he burned up [[H8313]] the flesh [[H1320]] and the hide [[H5785]] outside [[H2351]] the camp. [[H4264]]

###### 12
Then [Aaron] slaughtered [[H7819]] the burnt offering [[H5930]] and [his] [[H175]] sons [[H1121]] brought [[H4672]] him the blood, [[H1818]] and he sprinkled [[H2236]] it on [[H5921]] all sides [[H5439]] of the altar. [[H4196]]

###### 13
They brought [[H4672]] him [[H413]] the burnt offering [[H5930]] piece by piece, [[H5409]] including [[H853]] the head, [[H7218]] and he burned [[H6999]] them on [[H5921]] the altar. [[H4196]]

###### 14
He washed [[H7364]] the entrails [[H7130]] and the legs [[H3767]] and burned [them] [[H6999]] atop [[H5921]] the burnt offering [[H5930]] on the altar. [[H4196]]

###### 15
Aaron then presented [[H7126]] the people’s [[H5971]] offering. [[H7133]] He took [[H3947]] the male goat [[H8163]] for the people’s [[H5971]] sin offering, [[H2403]] slaughtered it, [[H7819]] and offered it for sin [[H2398]] like the first one. [[H7223]]

###### 16
He presented [[H7126]] the burnt offering [[H5930]] and offered it [[H6213]] according to the ordinance. [[H4941]]

###### 17
Next, he presented [[H7126]] the grain offering, [[H4503]] took [[H4390]] a handful [[H3709]] of it, [[H4480]] and burned [[H6999]] it on [[H5921]] the altar [[H4196]] in addition to [[H905]] the morning’s [[H1242]] burnt offering. [[H5930]]

###### 18
Then he slaughtered [[H7819]] the ox [[H7794]] and the ram [[H352]] as the people’s [[H5971]] peace offering. [[H8002]] [His] [[H175]] sons [[H1121]] brought [[H4672]] him the blood, [[H1818]] and he sprinkled [[H2236]] it on [[H5921]] all sides [[H5439]] of the altar. [[H4196]]

###### 19
They also brought the fat portions [[H2459]] from [[H4480]] the ox [[H7794]] and the ram— [[H352]] the fat tail, [[H451]] the fat [[H4374]] surrounding the entrails, the kidneys, [[H3629]] and the lobe [[H3508]] of the liver— [[H3516]]

###### 20
and placed [[H7760]] these [[H2459]] on [[H5921]] the breasts. [[H2373]] Aaron burned [[H6999]] the fat portions [[H2459]] on the altar, [[H4196]]

###### 21
but he [[H175]] waved [[H5130]] the breasts [[H2373]] and the right [[H3225]] thigh [[H7785]] as a wave offering [[H8573]] before [[H6440]] the LORD, [[H3069]] as [[H834]] Moses [[H4872]] had commanded. [[H6680]]

###### 22
Aaron [[H175]] lifted up [[H5375]] his hands [[H3027]] toward [[H413]] the people [[H5971]] and blessed them. [[H1288]] And having made [[H6213]] the sin offering, [[H2403]] the burnt offering, [[H5930]] and the peace offering, [[H8002]] he stepped down. [[H3381]]

###### 23
Moses [[H4872]] and Aaron [[H175]] then entered [[H935]] the Tent [[H168]] of Meeting. [[H4150]] When they came out, [[H3318]] they blessed [[H1288]] the people, [[H5971]] and the glory [[H3519]] of the LORD [[H3068]] appeared [[H7200]] to [[H413]] all [[H3605]] the people. [[H5971]]

###### 24
Fire [[H784]] came [[H3318]] out from the presence [[H6440]] of the LORD [[H3068]] and consumed [[H398]] the burnt offering [[H5930]] and the fat portions [[H2459]] on [[H5921]] the altar. [[H4196]] And when all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] saw it, [[H7200]] they shouted for joy [[H7442]] and fell [[H5307]] facedown. [[H5921]]
