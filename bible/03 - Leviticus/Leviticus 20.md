### 1
The LORD [[H3068]] said [[H1696]] to [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]]

### 2
“Tell [[H559]] the Israelites, [[H1121]] ‘Any [[H376]] Israelite [[H1121]] or foreigner [[H1616]] living [[H1481]] in Israel [[H3478]] who [[H834]] gives [[H5414]] any of [[H4480]] his children [[H2233]] to Molech [[H4432]] must be put to death. [[H4191]] The people [[H5971]] of the land [[H776]] are to stone [[H7275]] him. [[H68]]

### 3
And I [[H589]] will set [[H5414]] My face [[H6440]] against that [[H1931]] man [[H376]] and cut him off [[H3772]] from [[H7130]] his people, [[H5971]] because [[H3588]] by giving [[H5414]] his offspring [[H2233]] to Molech, [[H4432]] he has defiled [[H2930]] My sanctuary [[H4720]] and profaned [[H2490]] My holy [[H6944]] name. [[H8034]]

### 4
And if [[H518]] the people [[H5971]] of the land [[H776]] ever hide [[H5956]] their eyes [[H5869]] and fail [[H1115]] to put to death [[H4191]] the man [[H376]] who gives [[H5414]] one of [[H4480]] his children [[H2233]] to Molech, [[H4432]]

### 5
then I [[H589]] will set [[H7760]] My face [[H6440]] against that [[H1931]] man [[H376]] and his family [[H4940]] and cut off [[H3772]] from [[H7130]] their people [[H5971]] both him and all [[H3605]] who follow [[H310]] him in prostituting [[H2181]] themselves with [[H310]] Molech. [[H4432]]

### 6
Whoever [[H5315]] turns [[H6437]] to [[H413]] mediums [[H178]] or spiritists [[H3049]] to prostitute [[H2181]] himself with them, [[H310]] I will also set [[H5414]] My face [[H6440]] against that person [[H5315]] and cut him off [[H3772]] from [[H7130]] his people. [[H5971]]

### 7
Consecrate yourselves, [[H6942]] therefore, and be [[H1961]] holy, [[H6918]] for [[H3588]] I [[H589]] am the LORD [[H3069]] your God. [[H430]]

### 8
And you shall keep [[H8104]] My statutes [[H2708]] and practice them. [[H6213]] I [[H589]] am the LORD [[H3068]] who sanctifies you. [[H6942]]

### 9
If [[H3588]] anyone [[H376]] curses [[H7043]] his father [[H1]] or mother, [[H517]] he must be put to death. [[H4191]] He has cursed [[H7043]] his father [[H1]] or mother; [[H517]] his blood [[H1818]] [shall be] upon him. 

### 10
If a man [[H376]] commits adultery [[H5003]] with [[H854]] [another] man’s [[H376]] wife— [[H802]] with [[H854]] the wife [[H802]] of his neighbor— [[H7453]] both the adulterer [[H5003]] and the adulteress [[H5003]] must surely [[H4191]] be put to death. [[H4191]]

### 11
If a man [[H376]] lies [[H7901]] with [[H854]] his father’s [[H1]] wife, [[H802]] he has uncovered [[H1540]] his father’s [[H1]] nakedness. [[H6172]] Both [[H8147]] must surely [[H4191]] be put to death; [[H4191]] their blood [[H1818]] [is] upon them. 

### 12
If a man [[H376]] lies [[H7901]] with [[H854]] his daughter-in-law, [[H3618]] both [[H8147]] must surely [[H4191]] be put to death. [[H4191]] They have acted [[H6213]] perversely; [[H8397]] their blood [[H1818]] [is] upon them. 

### 13
If a man [[H376]] lies [[H7901]] with [[H854]] a man [[H2145]] as with a woman, [[H802]] they have both [[H8147]] committed [[H6213]] an abomination. [[H8441]] They must surely [[H4191]] be put to death; [[H4191]] their blood [[H1818]] [is] upon them. 

### 14
If a man [[H376]] marries [[H3947]] both a woman [[H802]] and her mother, [[H517]] it [[H1931]] is depraved. [[H2154]] Both he [[H853]] and they [[H853]] must be burned [[H8313]] in the fire, [[H784]] so that there will be [[H1961]] no [[H3808]] depravity [[H2154]] among you. [[H8432]]

### 15
If a man [[H376]] has sexual relations [[H5414]] with an animal, [[H929]] he must be put to death. [[H4191]] And [[H853]] you are also to kill [[H2026]] the animal. [[H929]]

### 16
If a woman [[H802]] approaches [[H7126]] any [[H3605]] animal [[H929]] to mate [[H7250]] with it, [[H854]] you must kill [[H2026]] both [[H853]] the woman [[H802]] and [[H853]] the animal. [[H929]] They must surely [[H4191]] be put to death; [[H4191]] their blood [[H1818]] [is] upon them. 

### 17
If a man [[H376]] marries [[H3947]] his sister, [[H269]] whether the daughter [[H1323]] of his father [[H1]] or [[H176]] his mother, [[H517]] and they have sexual relations, [[H7200]] it [[H1931]] is a disgrace. [[H2617]] They must be cut off [[H3772]] in the sight [[H5869]] of [[H1121]] their people. [[H5971]] He has uncovered [[H1540]] the nakedness [[H6172]] of his sister; [[H269]] he shall bear [[H5375]] his iniquity. [[H5771]]

### 18
If a man [[H376]] lies [[H7901]] with [[H854]] a menstruating [[H1739]] woman [[H802]] and has sexual relations with [[H1540]] her, [[H6172]] he has exposed [[H6168]] the source of her flow, [[H4726]] and she [[H1931]] has uncovered [[H1540]] the source [[H4726]] of her blood. [[H1818]] Both [[H8147]] of them must be cut off [[H3772]] from [[H7130]] their people. [[H5971]]

### 19
You must not [[H3808]] have sexual relations with [[H6172]] the sister [[H269]] of your mother [[H517]] or your father, [[H1]] for [[H3588]] it is exposing [[H6168]] one’s own kin; [[H7607]] both shall bear [[H5375]] their iniquity. [[H5771]]

### 20
If a man [[H376]] lies [[H7901]] with [[H854]] his uncle’s wife, [[H1733]] he has uncovered [[H1540]] the nakedness [[H6172]] of his uncle. [[H1730]] They will bear [[H5375]] their sin; [[H2399]] they shall die [[H4191]] childless. [[H6185]]

### 21
If a man [[H376]] marries [[H3947]] his brother’s [[H251]] wife, [[H802]] it [[H1931]] is an act of impurity. [[H5079]] He has uncovered [[H1540]] the nakedness [[H6172]] of his brother; [[H251]] they shall be [[H1961]] childless. [[H6185]]

### 22
You are therefore to keep [[H8104]] all [[H3605]] My statutes [[H2708]] and [[H3605]] ordinances, [[H4941]] so that the land [[H776]] where [[H834]] I [[H589]] am bringing [[H935]] you to live [[H3427]] will not [[H3808]] vomit you out. [[H6958]]

### 23
You must not [[H3808]] follow [[H1980]] the statutes [[H2708]] of the nations [[H1471]] I [[H589]] am driving out [[H7971]] before you, [[H6440]] for [[H3588]] they did [[H6213]] all [[H3605]] these things, [[H428]] and I abhorred them. [[H6973]]

### 24
But I have said [[H559]] to you,  “You [[H859]] will inherit [[H3423]] their land, [[H127]] since I [[H589]] will give [[H5414]] it to you  as an inheritance, [[H3423]] a land [[H776]] flowing [[H2100]] with milk [[H2461]] and honey.” [[H1706]] I [[H589]] am the LORD [[H3068]] your God, [[H430]] who [[H834]] has set you apart [[H914]] from [[H4480]] the peoples. [[H5971]]

### 25
You are therefore to distinguish [[H914]] between [[H996]] clean [[H2889]] and unclean [[H2931]] animals [[H929]] and [[H996]] birds. [[H5775]] Do not [[H3808]] become contaminated [[H8262]] by any animal [[H929]] or bird, [[H5775]] or by anything [[H3605]] that [[H834]] crawls [[H7430]] on the ground; [[H127]] I have set these [[H834]] apart [[H914]] as unclean [[H2930]] for you. 

### 26
You are to be [[H1961]] holy [[H6918]] to Me  because [[H3588]] I, [[H589]] the LORD, [[H3068]] am holy, [[H6918]] and I have set you apart [[H914]] from [[H4480]] the nations [[H5971]] that you should be [[H1961]] My own. 

### 27
A man [[H376]] or [[H176]] a woman [[H802]] who is [[H1961]] a medium [[H178]] or [[H176]] a spiritist [[H3049]] must surely [[H4191]] be put to death. [[H4191]] They shall be stoned; [[H7275]] their blood [[H1818]] [is] upon them.’”
