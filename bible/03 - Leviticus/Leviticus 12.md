### 1
Then the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H1696]] to [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]]

### 2
“Say [[H1696]] to [[H413]] the Israelites, [[H1121]] ‘A woman who [[H802]] becomes pregnant [[H2232]] and gives birth to [[H3205]] a son [[H2145]] will be unclean [[H2930]] for seven [[H7651]] days, [[H3117]] as she is during the days [[H3117]] of her menstruation. [[H5079]]

### 3
And on the eighth [[H8066]] day [[H3117]] the flesh [[H1320]] of [the boy’s] foreskin [[H6190]] is to be circumcised. [[H4135]]

### 4
The woman shall continue [[H3427]] in purification [[H2893]] from her bleeding [[H1818]] for thirty-three [[H7970]] days. [[H3117]] She must not [[H3808]] touch [[H5060]] anything [[H3605]] sacred [[H6944]] or go [[H935]] into [[H413]] the sanctuary [[H4720]] until [[H5704]] the days [[H3117]] of her purification [[H2893]] are complete. [[H4390]]

### 5
if, however, [[H518]] she gives birth to [[H3205]] a daughter, [[H5347]] [the woman] will be unclean [[H2930]] for two weeks [[H7620]] as she is during menstruation. [[H5079]] Then she must continue [[H3427]] in [[H5921]] purification [[H2893]] from her bleeding [[H1818]] for sixty-six [[H8346]] days. [[H3117]]

### 6
When the days [[H3117]] of her purification [[H2893]] are complete, [[H4390]] whether for a son [[H1121]] or [[H176]] daughter, [[H1323]] she is to bring [[H935]] to [[H413]] the priest [[H3548]] at [[H413]] the entrance [[H6607]] to the Tent [[H168]] of Meeting [[H4150]] a year-old [[H1121]] lamb [[H3532]] for a burnt offering [[H5930]] and a young [[H1121]] pigeon [[H3123]] or [[H176]] a turtledove [[H8449]] for a sin offering. [[H2403]]

### 7
And [the priest] will present them [[H7126]] before [[H6440]] the LORD [[H3069]] and make atonement [[H3722]] for her; [[H5921]] and she shall be cleansed [[H2891]] from her flow [[H4726]] of blood. [[H1818]] This [[H2063]] is the law [[H8451]] for a woman giving birth, [[H3205]] whether to a male [[H2145]] or [[H176]] female. [[H5347]]

### 8
But if [[H518]] she cannot [[H3808]] afford [[H4672]] a lamb, [[H7716]] she shall bring [[H3947]] two [[H8147]] turtledoves [[H8449]] or [[H176]] two [[H8147]] young [[H1121]] pigeons, [[H3123]] one [[H259]] for a burnt offering [[H5930]] and the other [[H259]] for a sin offering. [[H2403]] Then the priest [[H3548]] will make atonement [[H3722]] for her, [[H5921]] and she will be clean.’” [[H2891]]
