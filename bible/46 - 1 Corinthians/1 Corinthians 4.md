###### 1
So then, [[G3779]] men [[G444]] ought to regard [[G3049]] us [[G1473]] as [[G5613]] servants [[G5257]] of Christ [[G5547]] and [[G2532]] stewards [[G3623]] of the mysteries [[G3466]] of God. [[G2316]]

###### 2
Now [[G5602]] it is required [[G2212]] of stewards [[G3623]] that [[G2443]] they be found [[G2147]] faithful. [[G4103]]

###### 3
I [[G1473]] care very little, [[G1510]] however, [[G1161]] if [[G2443]] I am judged [[G350]] by [[G5259]] you [[G4771]] or [[G2228]] by [[G5259]] any human [[G442]] court. [[G2250]] In fact, [[G235]] I do not even judge [[G350]] myself. [[G1683]]

###### 4
My conscience is clear, [[G4894]] but [[G235]] that [[G3778]] does not vindicate me. [[G1344]] It is [[G1510]] [the] Lord [[G2962]] who [[G3588]] judges [[G350]] me. [[G1473]]

###### 5
Therefore [[G5620]] judge [[G2919]] nothing [[G5100]] before [[G4253]] [the] proper time; [[G2540]] [wait] until [[G2193]] the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] comes. [[G2064]] [He] [[G3739]] will bring to light [[G5461]] what is [[G3588]] hidden [[G2927]] in darkness [[G4655]] and [[G2532]] will expose [[G5319]] the [[G3588]] motives [[G1012]] of [ men’s ] [[G3588]] hearts. [[G2588]] At that time [[G5119]] each [[G1538]] will receive [[G1096]] [his] [[G3588]] praise [[G1868]] from [[G575]] God. [[G2316]]

###### 6
Brothers, [[G80]] I have applied [[G3345]] these things [[G3778]] to [[G1519]] myself [[G1683]] and [[G2532]] Apollos [[G625]] for your benefit, [[G1223]] so that [[G2443]] you may learn [[G3129]] from [[G1722]] us [[G1473]] not [[G3361]] [to go] beyond [[G5228]] what [[G3739]] is written. [[G1125]] Then [[G2443]] you will not take pride [[G5448]] in [[G5228]] one [man] [[G1520]] over [[G2596]] another. [[G2087]]

###### 7
For [[G1063]] who [[G5101]] makes you so superior? [[G1252]] What [[G5101]] do you have [[G2192]] that [[G3739]] you did not receive? [[G2983]] And [[G1161]] if [[G1487]] you did receive [it], [[G2983]] why [[G5101]] do you boast [[G2744]] as though [[G5613]] [you did not]? [[G2983]]

###### 8
Already [[G2235]] you have all you want. [[G2880]] Already [[G2235]] you have become rich. [[G4147]] Without [[G5565]] us, [[G1473]] you have become kings. [[G936]] How I wish [[G3785]] you really were kings, [[G936]] so that [[G2443]] we [[G1473]] might be kings with [[G4821]] you. [[G4771]]

###### 9
For [[G1063]] it seems to me [[G1380]] that [[G3588]] God [[G2316]] has displayed [[G584]] us [[G1473]] apostles [[G652]] at the end [ of the procession ], [[G2078]] like [[G5613]] [ prisoners ] appointed for death. [[G1935]] We have become [[G1096]] a spectacle [[G2302]] to the [[G3588]] whole world, [[G2889]] to angels [[G32]] as well as [[G2532]] to men. [[G444]]

###### 10
We [[G1473]] [are] fools [[G3474]] for [[G1223]] Christ, [[G5547]] but [[G1161]] you [[G4771]] [are] wise [[G5429]] in [[G1722]] Christ. [[G5547]] We [[G1473]] [are] weak, [[G772]] but [[G1161]] you [[G4771]] [are] strong. [[G2478]] You [[G4771]] [are] honored, [[G1741]] but [[G1161]] we [[G1473]] [are] dishonored. [[G820]]

###### 11
To [[G891]] [this] [[G3588]] very [[G737]] hour [[G5610]] we are hungry [[G3983]] and [[G2532]] thirsty, [[G1372]] we are poorly clothed, [[G1130]] we are brutally treated, [[G2852]] we are homeless. [[G790]]

###### 12
We work hard [[G2872]] with [our] [[G3588]] own [[G2398]] hands. [[G5495]] When we are vilified, [[G3058]] we bless; [[G2127]] when we are persecuted, [[G1377]] we endure [it]; [[G430]]

###### 13
when we are slandered, [[G1426]] we answer gently. [[G3870]] Up to [[G2193]] this moment [[G737]] we have become [[G1096]] [the] scum [[G4027]] of the [[G3588]] earth, [[G2889]] [the] refuse [[G4067]] of [the world]. [[G3956]]

###### 14
I am not writing [[G1125]] this [[G3778]] to shame [[G1788]] you, [[G4771]] but [[G235]] to warn you [[G3560]] as [[G5613]] my [[G1473]] beloved [[G27]] children. [[G5043]]

###### 15
Even [[G1063]] if [[G1437]] you have [[G2192]] ten thousand [[G3463]] guardians [[G3807]] in [[G1722]] Christ, [[G5547]] [you do] not [[G3756]] [have] many [[G4183]] fathers; [[G3962]] for [[G1063]] in [[G1722]] Christ [[G5547]] Jesus [[G2424]] I [[G1473]] became your father [[G1080]] through [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] gospel. [[G2098]]

###### 16
Therefore [[G3767]] I urge [[G3870]] you [[G4771]] to imitate [[G3402]] me. [[G1473]]

###### 17
That is why [[G1223]] I have sent [[G3992]] you [[G4771]] Timothy, [[G5095]] my [[G1473]] beloved [[G27]] and [[G2532]] faithful [[G4103]] child [[G5043]] in [[G1722]] [the] Lord. [[G2962]] [He] [[G3739]] will remind [[G363]] you [[G4771]] of my [[G1473]] way of life [[G3598]] in [[G1722]] Christ [[G5547]] Jesus, [[G2424]] which is exactly what [[G2531]] I teach [[G1321]] everywhere [[G3837]] in [[G1722]] every [[G3956]] church. [[G1577]]

###### 18
Some [of you] [[G5100]] have become arrogant, [[G5448]] as if [[G5613]] I [[G1473]] were not coming [[G2064]] to [[G4314]] you. [[G4771]]

###### 19
But [[G1161]] I will come [[G2064]] to [[G4314]] you [[G4771]] shortly, [[G5030]] if [[G1437]] the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] is willing, [[G2309]] and [then] [[G2532]] I will find out [[G1097]] not [only] [[G3756]] what [[G3588]] these [[G3588]] arrogant [people] [[G5448]] are saying, [[G3056]] but [[G235]] what [[G3588]] power [they have]. [[G1411]]

###### 20
For [[G1063]] the [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] of God [is] [[G2316]] not [[G3756]] a matter of [[G1722]] talk [[G3056]] but [[G235]] of [[G1722]] power. [[G1411]]

###### 21
Which [[G5101]] do you prefer? [[G2309]] Shall I come [[G2064]] to [[G4314]] you [[G4771]] with [[G1722]] a rod, [[G4464]] or [[G2228]] in [[G1722]] love [[G26]] and [with] [[G5037]] a gentle [[G4240]] spirit? [[G4151]]
