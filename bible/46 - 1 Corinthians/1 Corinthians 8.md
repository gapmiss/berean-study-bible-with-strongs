###### 1
Now [[G1161]] about [[G4012]] [food] [[G3588]] sacrificed to idols: [[G1494]] We know [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] we all have [[G2192]] knowledge. [[G1108]] Knowledge [[G1108]] puffs up, [[G5448]] but [[G1161]] love [[G26]] builds up. [[G3618]]

###### 2
The one who [[G5100]] thinks [[G1380]] he knows [[G1097]] something [[G5100]] does not yet know [[G1097]] as [[G2531]] he ought [[G1163]] to know. [[G1097]]

###### 3
But [[G1161]] the one who [[G5100]] loves [[G25]] God [[G2316]] is known [[G1097]] by [[G5259]] [God]. [[G846]]

###### 4
So [[G3767]] about [[G4012]] eating [[G1035]] food sacrificed to idols: [[G1494]] We know [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] an idol [[G1497]] [is] nothing at all [[G3762]] in [[G1722]] [the] world, [[G2889]] and [[G2532]] that [[G3754]] [there is] no [[G3762]] God [[G2316]] but [[G1487]] one. [[G1520]]

###### 5
For [[G1063]] even [[G2532]] if [[G1512]] there are [[G1510]] so-called [[G3004]] gods, [[G2316]] whether [[G1535]] in [[G1722]] heaven [[G3772]] or [[G1535]] on [[G1909]] earth [[G1093]] (as [[G5618]] there are [[G1510]] many [ so-called ] [[G4183]] gods [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] lords), [[G2962]]

###### 6
yet [[G235]] for us [[G1473]] [ there is but ] one [[G1520]] God, [[G2316]] the [[G3588]] Father, [[G3962]] from [[G1537]] whom [[G3739]] all [[G3956]] things [came] [[G3588]] and [[G2532]] for [[G1519]] [whom] [[G846]] we [exist]. [[G1473]] And [ there is but ] [[G2532]] one [[G1520]] Lord, [[G2962]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ, [[G5547]] through [[G1223]] whom [[G3739]] all [[G3956]] things [came] [[G3588]] and [[G2532]] through [[G1223]] [whom] [[G846]] we [exist]. [[G1473]]

###### 7
But [[G235]] not [[G3756]] everyone [[G3956]] [has] [[G1722]] this [[G3588]] knowledge. [[G1108]] Some [[G5100]] [people] [[G3588]] are still so accustomed [[G4914]] to idols [[G1497]] [that] they eat [such food] [[G2068]] as if [[G5613]] it were sacrificed to an idol. [[G1494]] And [[G2532]] [since] their [[G846]] conscience [[G4893]] is [[G1510]] weak, [[G772]] it is defiled. [[G3435]]

###### 8
But [[G1161]] food [[G1033]] does not bring us closer [[G3936]] to [[G3588]] God: [[G2316]] We are no worse [[G5302]] if [[G1437]] we do not eat, [[G5315]] [and] [[G3777]] no [[G3361]] [better] [[G4052]] if [[G1437]] we do. [[G5315]]

###### 9
Be careful, [[G991]] however, [[G1161]] [that] [[G3778]] your [[G4771]] freedom [[G1849]] does not become [[G1096]] a stumbling block [[G4348]] to the [[G3588]] weak. [[G772]]

###### 10
For [[G1063]] if [[G1437]] someone [[G5100]] [with] [[G846]] a weak [[G772]] conscience [[G4893]] sees [[G3708]] you [[G4771]] who [[G3588]] are well informed [[G1108]] eating [[G2621]] in [[G1722]] an idol’s temple, [[G1493]] {will he} not [[G3780]] be [[G1510]] encouraged [[G3618]] to [[G1519]] eat [[G2068]] [food] [[G3588]] sacrificed to idols? [[G1494]]

###### 11
[So] [[G1063]] [this] [[G3588]] weak [[G770]] brother, [[G80]] for [[G1223]] whom [[G3739]] Christ [[G5547]] died, [[G599]] is destroyed [[G622]] by [[G1722]] your [[G4674]] knowledge. [[G1108]]

###### 12
By sinning [[G264]] against [[G1519]] [your] [[G3588]] brothers [[G80]] in this way [[G3779]] and [[G2532]] wounding [[G5180]] their [[G846]] weak [[G770]] conscience, [[G4893]] you sin [[G264]] against [[G1519]] Christ. [[G5547]]

###### 13
Therefore, [[G1355]] if [[G1487]] [what I eat] [[G1033]] causes [[G4624]] my [[G1473]] brother {to stumble}, [[G80]] I will never eat [[G5315]] meat [[G2907]] [again], [[G165]] so that [[G2443]] I will not cause [[G4624]] [him] {to stumble}. [[G80]]
