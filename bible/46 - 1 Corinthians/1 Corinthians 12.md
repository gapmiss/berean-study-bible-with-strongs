###### 1
Now [[G1161]] about [[G4012]] spiritual [gifts], [[G4152]] brothers, [[G80]] I do not want [[G2309]] you [[G4771]] to be uninformed. [[G50]]

###### 2
You know [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] when [[G3753]] you were [[G1510]] pagans, [[G1484]] you were influenced [[G71]] [and] led astray [[G520]] to [[G4314]] mute [[G880]] idols. [[G1497]]

###### 3
Therefore [[G1352]] I inform [[G1107]] you [[G4771]] that [[G3754]] no one [[G3762]] who is speaking [[G2980]] by [[G1722]] [the] Spirit [[G4151]] of God [[G2316]] says, [[G3004]] “Jesus [[G2424]] [be] cursed,” [[G331]] and [[G2532]] no one [[G3762]] can [[G1410]] say, [[G2036]] “Jesus [[G2424]] [is] Lord,” [[G2962]] except [[G1487]] by [[G1722]] [the] Holy [[G40]] Spirit. [[G4151]]

###### 4
There are [[G1510]] different [[G1243]] gifts, [[G5486]] but [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] same [[G846]] Spirit. [[G4151]]

###### 5
There are [[G1510]] different [[G1243]] ministries, [[G1248]] but [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] same [[G846]] Lord. [[G2962]]

###### 6
There are [[G1510]] different ways [[G1243]] of working, [[G1755]] but [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] same [[G846]] God [[G2316]] works [[G1754]] all things [[G3956]] in [[G1722]] all men. [[G3956]]

###### 7
Now [[G1161]] to each one [[G1538]] the [[G3588]] manifestation [[G5321]] of the [[G3588]] Spirit [[G4151]] is given [[G1325]] for [[G4314]] the [[G3588]] common good. [[G4851]]

###### 8
To one [[G3739]] there is given [[G1325]] through [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] Spirit [[G4151]] [the] message [[G3056]] of wisdom, [[G4678]] to another [[G243]] [the] message [[G3056]] of knowledge [[G1108]] by [[G2596]] the [[G3588]] same [[G846]] Spirit, [[G4151]]

###### 9
to another [[G2087]] faith [[G4102]] by [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] same [[G846]] Spirit, [[G4151]] to another [[G243]] gifts [[G5486]] of healing [[G2386]] by [[G1722]] that [[G3588]] one [[G1520]] Spirit, [[G4151]]

###### 10
to another [[G243]] [the] working [[G1755]] of miracles, [[G1411]] to another [[G243]] prophecy, [[G4394]] to another [[G243]] distinguishing [[G1253]] between spirits, [[G4151]] to another [[G2087]] speaking in various tongues, [[G1100]] and [[G1161]] to [still] another [[G243]] [the] interpretation [[G2058]] of tongues. [[G1100]]

###### 11
All [[G3956]] these [[G3778]] are the work [[G1754]] of one [[G1520]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] same [[G846]] Spirit, [[G4151]] who apportions [them] [[G1244]] to each [[G1538]] one [[G2398]] as [[G2531]] He determines. [[G1014]]

###### 12
The [[G3588]] body [[G4983]] is [[G1510]] a unit, [[G1520]] though [[G2532]] it is comprised [[G2192]] of many [[G4183]] parts. [[G3196]] And [although] [[G1161]] [its] [[G3588]] parts [[G3196]] are [[G1510]] many, [[G4183]] they all [[G3956]] form [[G1510]] one [[G1520]] body. [[G4983]] So [[G3779]] [it is] [[G2532]] with Christ. [[G5547]]

###### 13
For [[G1063]] in [[G1722]] one [[G1520]] Spirit [[G4151]] we [[G1473]] were all baptized [[G907]] into [[G1519]] one [[G1520]] body, [[G4983]] whether [[G1535]] Jews [[G2453]] or [[G1535]] Greeks, [[G1672]] slave [[G1401]] or [[G1535]] free, [[G1658]] and [[G2532]] we were all given [[G4222]] one [[G1520]] Spirit {to drink}. [[G4151]]

###### 14
For [[G1063]] the [[G3588]] body [[G4983]] does not consist [[G1510]] of one [[G1520]] part, [[G3196]] but [[G235]] of many. [[G4183]]

###### 15
If [[G1437]] the [[G3588]] foot [[G4228]] should say, [[G2036]] “Because [[G3754]] I am [[G1510]] not [[G3756]] a hand, [[G5495]] I do [[G1510]] not [[G3756]] belong [[G1537]] to the [[G3588]] body,” [[G4983]] that [[G3844]] would [[G1510]] not [[G3756]] [ make it any less ] [[G3756]] a part of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] body. [[G4983]]

###### 16
And [[G2532]] if [[G1437]] the [[G3588]] ear [[G3775]] should say, [[G2036]] “Because [[G3754]] I am [[G1510]] not [[G3756]] an eye, [[G3788]] I do [[G1510]] not [[G3756]] belong [[G1537]] to the [[G3588]] body,” [[G4983]] that [[G3844]] would [[G1510]] not [[G3756]] [ make it any less ] [[G3756]] a part of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] body. [[G4983]]

###### 17
If [[G1487]] the [[G3588]] whole [[G3650]] body [were] [[G4983]] an eye, [[G3788]] where [[G4226]] [would] the [[G3588]] sense of hearing [be]? [[G189]] If [[G1487]] [the] whole [body] [[G3650]] [were] an ear, [[G189]] where [[G4226]] [would] the [[G3588]] sense of smell [be]? [[G3750]]

###### 18
But [[G1161]] in fact, [[G3570]] God [[G2316]] has arranged [[G5087]] the [[G3588]] members [[G3196]] of [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] body, [[G4983]] every [[G1538]] one [[G1520]] of them, [[G846]] according to [[G2531]] His design. [[G2309]]

###### 19
If [[G1487]] they were [[G1510]] all [[G3956]] one [[G1520]] part, [[G3196]] where [[G4226]] [would] the [[G3588]] body [be]? [[G4983]]

###### 20
As it is, [[G3568]] [there are] many [[G4183]] parts, [[G3196]] but [[G1161]] one [[G1520]] body. [[G4983]]

###### 21
The [[G3588]] eye [[G3788]] cannot [[G1410]] say [[G2036]] to the [[G3588]] hand, [[G5495]] “I do [[G2192]] not [[G3756]] need [[G5532]] you.” [[G4771]] [Nor can] [[G2228]] the [[G3588]] head [say] [[G2776]] to the [[G3588]] feet, [[G4228]] “I do [[G2192]] not [[G3756]] need [[G5532]] you.” [[G4771]]

###### 22
On the contrary, [[G235]] the [[G3588]] parts [[G3196]] of the [[G3588]] body [[G4983]] that seem [[G1380]] to be [[G5225]] weaker [[G772]] are [[G1510]] indispensable, [[G316]]

###### 23
and [[G2532]] the [[G3739]] [parts] [[G4983]] we consider [[G1380]] less honorable, [[G820]] we treat [[G4060]] with greater [[G4053]] honor. [[G5092]] And [[G2532]] our [[G1473]] unpresentable [parts] [[G809]] are treated with [[G2192]] special [[G4053]] modesty, [[G2157]]

###### 24
whereas [[G1161]] our [[G1473]] presentable [parts] [[G2158]] have [[G2192]] no [such] [[G3756]] need. [[G5532]] But [[G235]] God [[G2316]] has composed [[G4786]] the [[G3588]] body [[G4983]] [and] has given [[G1325]] greater [[G4053]] honor [[G5092]] to the [parts] [[G3588]] that lacked it, [[G5302]]

###### 25
so that [[G2443]] there should be [[G1510]] no [[G3361]] division [[G4978]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] body, [[G4983]] but that [[G235]] [its] [[G3588]] members [[G3196]] {should have} [[G3588]] mutual [[G846]] concern [[G3309]] for [[G5228]] one another. [[G240]]

###### 26
If [[G1535]] one [[G1520]] part [[G3196]] suffers, [[G3958]] every [[G3956]] part [[G3196]] suffers with [it]; [[G4841]] if [[G1535]] one [[G1520]] part [[G3196]] is honored, [[G1392]] every [[G3956]] part [[G3196]] rejoices with [it]. [[G4796]]

###### 27
Now [[G1161]] you [[G4771]] are [[G1510]] [the] body [[G4983]] of Christ, [[G5547]] and [[G2532]] each of you [is] [[G1537]] a member [of it]. [[G3196]]

###### 28
And [[G2532]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] church [[G1577]] God [[G2316]] has appointed [[G5087]] first of all [[G4412]] apostles, [[G652]] second [[G1208]] prophets, [[G4396]] third [[G5154]] teachers, [[G1320]] then [[G1899]] [workers of] miracles, [[G1411]] [and] [[G1899]] [those with] gifts [[G5486]] of healing, [[G2386]] helping, [[G484]] administration, [[G2941]] [and] various [[G1085]] tongues. [[G1100]]

###### 29
[Are] [[G3361]] all [[G3956]] apostles? [[G652]] [Are] [[G3361]] all [[G3956]] prophets? [[G4396]] [Are] [[G3361]] all [[G3956]] teachers? [[G1320]] [Do] [[G3361]] all [work] [[G3956]] miracles? [[G1411]]

###### 30
[Do] [[G3361]] all [[G3956]] have [[G2192]] gifts [[G5486]] of healing? [[G2386]] [Do] [[G3361]] all [[G3956]] speak [[G2980]] in tongues? [[G1100]] [Do] [[G3361]] all [[G3956]] interpret? [[G1329]]

###### 31
But [[G1161]] eagerly desire [[G2206]] the [[G3588]] greater [[G3173]] gifts. [[G5486]] And [[G2532]] now [[G2089]] I will show [[G1166]] you [[G4771]] a way [[G3598]] that is beyond comparison. [[G5236]]
