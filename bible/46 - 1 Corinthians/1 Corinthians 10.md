### 1
I do not want [[G2309]] you [[G4771]] to be unaware, [[G50]] brothers, [[G80]] that [[G3754]] our [[G1473]] forefathers [[G3962]] were [[G1510]] all [[G3956]] under [[G5259]] the [[G3588]] cloud, [[G3507]] and [that] [[G2532]] they all [[G3956]] passed [[G1330]] through [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] sea. [[G2281]]

### 2
They were all baptized [[G907]] into [[G1519]] Moses [[G3475]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] cloud [[G3507]] and [[G2532]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] sea. [[G2281]]

### 3
They all [[G3956]] ate [[G5315]] the [[G3588]] same [[G846]] spiritual [[G4152]] food [[G1033]]

### 4
and [[G2532]] drank [[G4095]] the [[G3588]] same [[G846]] spiritual [[G4152]] drink; [[G4188]] for [[G1063]] they drank [[G4095]] from [[G1537]] [the] spiritual [[G4152]] rock [[G4073]] that accompanied them, [[G190]] and [[G1161]] [that] [[G3588]] rock [[G4073]] was [[G1510]] Christ. [[G5547]]

### 5
Nevertheless, [[G235]] God [[G2316]] was not pleased [[G2106]] with [[G1722]] most [[G4119]] of them, [[G846]] for [[G1063]] they were struck down [[G2693]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] wilderness. [[G2048]]

### 6
These things [[G3778]] took place [[G1096]] as examples [[G5179]] to keep [[G1519]] us [[G1473]] from craving [[G1938]] evil things [[G2556]] as [[G2531]] they [[G2548]] [did]. [[G1937]]

### 7
Do not be [[G1096]] idolaters, [[G1496]] as [[G2531]] some [[G5100]] of them [were]. [[G846]] As [[G5618]] it is written: [[G1125]] “The [[G3588]] people [[G2992]] sat down [[G2523]] to eat [[G5315]] and [[G2532]] to drink, [[G4095]] and [[G2532]] got up [[G450]] to indulge in revelry.” [[G3815]]

### 8
We should not commit sexual immorality, [[G4203]] as [[G2531]] some [[G5100]] of them [[G846]] [did], [[G4203]] and [[G2532]] in one [[G1520]] day [[G2250]] twenty-three [[G1501]] thousand [of them] [[G5505]] died. [[G4098]]

### 9
We should not test [[G1598]] Christ, [[G5547]] as [[G2531]] some [[G5100]] of them [[G846]] [did], [[G3985]] and [[G2532]] were killed [[G622]] by [[G5259]] snakes. [[G3789]]

### 10
And do not complain, [[G1111]] as [[G2509]] some [[G5100]] of them [[G846]] [did], [[G1111]] and [[G2532]] were killed [[G622]] by [[G5259]] the [[G3588]] destroying angel. [[G3644]]

### 11
Now [[G1161]] these things [[G3778]] happened [[G4819]] to them [[G1565]] [as] examples [[G5179]] and [[G1161]] were written down [[G1125]] as warnings [[G3559]] for [[G4314]] us, [[G1473]] on [[G1519]] whom [[G3739]] the [[G3588]] fulfillment [[G5056]] of the [[G3588]] ages [[G165]] has come. [[G2658]]

### 12
So [[G5620]] the [one who] [[G3588]] thinks [[G1380]] he is standing firm [[G2476]] should be careful [[G991]] not [[G3361]] to fall. [[G4098]]

### 13
No [[G3756]] temptation [[G3986]] has seized [[G2983]] you [[G4771]] except [[G1487]] what is common to man. [[G442]] And [[G1161]] God [[G2316]] [is] faithful; [[G4103]] [He] [[G3739]] will not let [[G1439]] you [[G4771]] be tempted [[G3985]] beyond [[G5228]] what [[G3739]] you can bear. [[G1410]] But [[G235]] when [[G4862]] [you are] tempted, [[G3986]] He will also provide [[G4160]] an escape, [[G1545]] so that you can [[G1410]] stand up under [it]. [[G5297]]

### 14
Therefore, [[G1355]] my [[G1473]] beloved, [[G27]] flee [[G5343]] from [[G575]] idolatry. [[G1495]]

### 15
I speak [[G3004]] to reasonable [people]; [[G5429]] judge [[G2919]] for yourselves [[G4771]] what [[G3739]] I say. [[G5346]]

### 16
Is [[G1510]] not [[G3780]] the [[G3588]] cup [[G4221]] of blessing [[G2129]] that [[G3739]] we bless [[G2127]] a participation [[G2842]] in the [[G3588]] blood [[G129]] of Christ? [[G5547]] [And] is [[G1510]] not [[G3780]] the [[G3588]] bread [[G740]] that [[G3739]] we break [[G2806]] a participation [[G2842]] in the [[G3588]] body [[G4983]] of Christ? [[G5547]]

### 17
Because [there is] [[G3754]] one [[G1520]] loaf, [[G740]] [we who are] [[G3588]] many [[G4183]] are [[G1510]] one [[G1520]] body; [[G4983]] for [[G1063]] we all partake [[G3348]] of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] one [[G1520]] loaf. [[G740]]

### 18
Consider [[G991]] the people [[G4561]] of Israel: [[G2474]] Are [[G1510]] not [[G3756]] those who [[G3588]] eat [[G2068]] the [[G3588]] sacrifices [[G2378]] fellow partakers [[G2844]] in the [[G3588]] altar? [[G2379]]

### 19
Am I suggesting, [[G5346]] then, [[G3767]] that [[G3754]] food sacrificed to an idol [[G1494]] is [[G1510]] anything, [[G5100]] or [[G2228]] that [[G3754]] an idol [[G1497]] is [[G1510]] anything? [[G5100]]

### 20
No, [[G235]] [but] [[G3754]] [the] [[G3739]] sacrifices [[G2380]] of pagans [[G1484]] are offered [[G2380]] to demons, [[G1140]] not [[G3756]] to God. [[G2316]] And [[G1161]] I do not want [[G2309]] you [[G4771]] to be [[G1096]] participants [[G2844]] with demons. [[G1140]]

### 21
You cannot [[G1410]] drink [[G4095]] [the] cup [[G4221]] of [the] Lord [[G2962]] and [[G2532]] [the] cup [[G4221]] of demons [too]; [[G1140]] you cannot [[G1410]] partake [[G3348]] in [the] table [[G5132]] of [the] Lord [[G2962]] and [[G2532]] [the] table [[G5132]] of demons {too}. [[G1140]]

### 22
Are we trying to provoke [[G3863]] the [[G3588]] Lord {to jealousy}? [[G2962]] Are we [[G1510]] stronger [[G2478]] than He? [[G846]]

### 23
“Everything [[G3956]] is permissible,” [[G1832]] but [[G235]] not [[G3756]] everything [[G3956]] is beneficial. [[G4851]] “Everything [[G3956]] is permissible,” [[G1832]] but [[G235]] not [[G3756]] everything [[G3956]] is edifying. [[G3618]]

### 24
No one [[G3367]] should seek [[G2212]] his own [[G1438]] [good], [[G3588]] but [[G235]] [the good] [[G3588]] of others. [[G2087]]

### 25
Eat [[G2068]] anything [[G3956]] sold [[G4453]] in [[G1722]] [the] meat market [[G3111]] without [[G3367]] raising questions [[G350]] of [[G1223]] conscience, [[G4893]]

### 26
for, [[G1063]] “The [[G3588]] earth [[G1093]] [is] the [[G3588]] Lord’s, [[G2962]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] fullness [[G4138]] thereof.” [[G846]]

### 27
If [[G1487]] an [[G5100]] unbeliever [[G571]] invites [[G2564]] you {to a meal} [[G4771]] and [[G2532]] you want [[G2309]] to go, [[G4198]] eat [[G2068]] anything [[G3956]] set before [[G3908]] you [[G4771]] without [[G3367]] raising questions [[G350]] of [[G1223]] conscience. [[G4893]]

### 28
But [[G1161]] if [[G1437]] someone [[G5100]] tells [[G2036]] you, [[G4771]] “This [food] [[G3778]] was [[G1510]] offered to idols,” [[G1494]] {then do} not [[G3361]] eat [it], [[G2068]] for the sake of [[G1223]] the one [[G1565]] who [[G3588]] told [you] [[G3377]] and [[G2532]] for the sake of conscience— [[G4893]]

### 29
the [[G3588]] other [one’s] [[G2087]] [ conscience ], [[G3588]] I mean, [[G3004]] not [[G3780]] your own. [[G1438]] For [[G1063]] why [[G2443]] {should} my [[G1473]] freedom [[G1657]] be determined [[G2919]] by [[G5259]] someone else’s [[G243]] conscience? [[G4893]]

### 30
If [[G1487]] I [[G1473]] partake [in the meal] [[G3348]] with thankfulness, [[G5485]] why [[G5101]] am I denounced [[G987]] because of [[G5228]] that for which [[G3739]] I [[G1473]] give thanks? [[G2168]]

### 31
So [[G3767]] whether [[G1535]] you eat [[G2068]] or [[G1535]] drink [[G4095]] or [[G1535]] whatever [[G5100]] you do, [[G4160]] do [[G4160]] it all [[G3956]] to the [[G1519]] glory [[G1391]] of God. [[G2316]]

### 32
Do not become a stumbling block, [[G1096]] whether [[G2532]] to Jews [[G2453]] [or] [[G2532]] Greeks [[G1672]] [or] [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] church [[G1577]] of God, [[G2316]]

### 33
just as I [[G2531]] [try to] please [[G700]] everyone [[G3956]] in all [I do]. [[G3956]] [For] I am not seeking [[G2212]] my [own] [[G1683]] good, [[G4851]] but [[G235]] [the good] [[G3588]] of many, [[G4183]] that [[G2443]] they may be saved. [[G4982]]
