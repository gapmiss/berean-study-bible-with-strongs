###### 1
Paul, [[G3972]] called [to be] [[G2822]] an apostle [[G652]] of Christ [[G5547]] Jesus [[G2424]] by [[G1223]] [the] will [[G2307]] of God, [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] [our] [[G3588]] brother [[G80]] Sosthenes, [[G4988]]

###### 2
To the [[G3588]] church [[G1577]] of God [[G2316]] in [[G1722]] Corinth, [[G2882]] [to those] sanctified [[G37]] in [[G1722]] Christ [[G5547]] Jesus [[G2424]] [and] called [[G2822]] [to be] holy, [[G40]] together with [[G4862]] all [[G3956]] those [[G3588]] everywhere [[G5117]] [who] call on [[G1941]] the [[G3588]] name [[G3686]] of our [[G1473]] Lord [[G2962]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ, [[G5547]] their [Lord] [[G846]] and [[G2532]] ours: [[G1473]]

###### 3
Grace [[G5485]] and [[G2532]] peace [[G1515]] to you [[G4771]] from [[G575]] God [[G2316]] our [[G1473]] Father [[G3962]] and [[G2532]] [the] Lord [[G2962]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ. [[G5547]]

###### 4
I always thank [[G2168]] my [[G1473]] God [[G2316]] for [[G4012]] you [[G4771]] because of [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] grace [[G5485]] [He] [[G2316]] has given [[G1325]] you [[G4771]] in [[G1722]] Christ [[G5547]] Jesus. [[G2424]]

###### 5
For [[G3754]] in [[G1722]] Him [[G846]] you have been enriched [[G4148]] in [[G1722]] every way, [[G3956]] in [[G1722]] all [[G3956]] speech [[G3056]] and [[G2532]] all [[G3956]] knowledge, [[G1108]]

###### 6
because [[G2531]] [our] [[G3588]] testimony [[G3142]] about [[G3588]] Christ [[G5547]] was confirmed [[G950]] in [[G1722]] you. [[G4771]]

###### 7
Therefore [[G5620]] you [[G4771]] do not lack [[G5302]] [any] [[G3367]] spiritual gift [[G5486]] as you eagerly await [[G553]] the [[G3588]] revelation [[G602]] of our [[G1473]] Lord [[G2962]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ. [[G5547]]

###### 8
[He] [[G3739]] will sustain [[G950]] you [[G4771]] to [[G2193]] [the] end, [[G5056]] [so that you will be] blameless [[G410]] on [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] day [[G2250]] of our [[G1473]] Lord [[G2962]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ. [[G5547]]

###### 9
God, [[G2316]] who [[G3739]] has called you [[G2564]] into [[G1519]] fellowship [[G2842]] with His [[G846]] Son [[G5207]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ [[G5547]] our [[G1473]] Lord, [[G2962]] [is] faithful. [[G4103]]

###### 10
I appeal [[G3870]] to you, [[G4771]] brothers, [[G80]] in [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] name [[G3686]] of our [[G1473]] Lord [[G2962]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ, [[G5547]] that [[G2443]] all of [[G3956]] you agree together, [[G3004]] [so that] [[G2532]] there may be [[G1510]] no [[G3361]] divisions [[G4978]] among [[G1722]] you [[G4771]] and [that] [[G1161]] you may be [[G1510]] united [[G2675]] in [[G1722]] mind [[G3563]] and [[G2532]] conviction. [[G1106]]

###### 11
My [[G1473]] brothers, [[G80]] some [[G3588]] from Chloe’s household [[G5514]] have informed [[G1213]] me [[G1473]] that [[G3754]] there are [[G1510]] quarrels [[G2054]] among [[G1722]] you. [[G4771]]

###### 12
What I mean [[G3004]] [is] this: [[G3778]] Individuals [[G1538]] among you [[G4771]] are saying, [[G3004]] “I [[G1473]] [follow] [[G1510]] Paul,” [[G3972]] “I [[G1473]] [follow] Apollos,” [[G625]] “I [[G1473]] [follow] Cephas,” [[G2786]] [or] [[G1161]] “I [[G1473]] [follow] Christ.” [[G5547]]

###### 13
{Is} Christ [[G5547]] divided? [[G3307]] {Was} Paul [[G3972]] crucified [[G4717]] for [[G5228]] you? [[G4771]] Were you baptized [[G907]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] name [[G3686]] of Paul? [[G3972]]

###### 14
I thank [[G2168]] God [[G2316]] that [[G3754]] I did not baptize any [[G907]] of you [[G4771]] except [[G1487]] Crispus [[G2921]] and [[G2532]] Gaius, [[G1050]]

###### 15
so [[G2443]] no [[G3361]] one [[G5100]] can say [[G2036]] that [[G3754]] you were baptized [[G907]] into [[G1519]] my [[G1699]] name. [[G3686]]

###### 16
Yes, [[G1161]] I also baptized [[G907]] the [[G3588]] household [[G3624]] of Stephanas; [[G4734]] beyond that [[G3063]] I do not remember [[G1492]] baptizing [[G907]] anyone [[G5100]] else. [[G243]]

###### 17
For [[G1063]] Christ [[G5547]] {did} not [[G3756]] send [[G649]] me [[G1473]] to baptize, [[G907]] but [[G235]] to preach the gospel, [[G2097]] not [[G3756]] with [[G1722]] eloquent words [[G3056]] of wisdom, [[G4678]] lest [[G2443]] the [[G3588]] cross [[G4716]] of [[G3588]] Christ [[G5547]] be emptied of [its] power. [[G2758]]

###### 18
For [[G1063]] the [[G3588]] message [[G3056]] of the [[G3588]] cross [[G4716]] is [[G1510]] foolishness [[G3472]] to those who [[G3588]] are perishing, [[G622]] but [[G1161]] to us who [[G1473]] are being saved [[G4982]] it is [[G1510]] [the] power [[G1411]] of God. [[G2316]]

###### 19
For [[G1063]] it is written: [[G1125]] “I will destroy [[G622]] the [[G3588]] wisdom [[G4678]] of the [[G3588]] wise; [[G4680]] the [[G3588]] intelligence [[G4907]] of the [[G3588]] intelligent [[G4908]] I will frustrate.” [[G114]]

###### 20
Where [is the] [[G4226]] wise [man]? [[G4680]] Where [is] [[G4226]] [the] scribe? [[G1122]] Where [is] [[G4226]] [the] philosopher [[G4804]] of this [[G3778]] age? [[G165]] {Has} not [[G3780]] God [[G2316]] made foolish [[G3471]] the [[G3588]] wisdom [[G4678]] of the [[G3588]] world? [[G2889]]

###### 21
For [[G1063]] since [[G1894]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] wisdom [[G4678]] of God, [[G2316]] the [[G3588]] world [[G2889]] through [[G1223]] [its] [[G3588]] wisdom [[G4678]] {did} not [[G3756]] know [[G1097]] [Him], [[G2316]] God [[G2316]] was pleased [[G2106]] through [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] foolishness [[G3472]] of what [[G3588]] was preached [[G2782]] to save [[G4982]] those who [[G3588]] believe. [[G4100]]

###### 22
Jews [[G2453]] demand [[G154]] signs [[G4592]] and [[G2532]] Greeks [[G1672]] search for [[G2212]] wisdom, [[G4678]]

###### 23
but [[G1161]] we [[G1473]] preach [[G2784]] Christ [[G5547]] crucified, [[G4717]] a stumbling block [[G4625]] to Jews [[G2453]] and [[G1161]] foolishness [[G3472]] to Gentiles, [[G1484]]

###### 24
but [[G1161]] to those [[G846]] who [[G3588]] are called, [[G2822]] both [[G5037]] Jews [[G2453]] and [[G2532]] Greeks, [[G1672]] Christ [[G5547]] [the] power [[G1411]] of God [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] [the] wisdom [[G4678]] of God. [[G2316]]

###### 25
For [[G3754]] the [[G3588]] foolishness [[G3474]] of God [[G2316]] is [[G1510]] wiser [[G4680]] than man’s [wisdom], [[G444]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] weakness [[G772]] of God [[G2316]] [is] stronger [[G2478]] than man’s [strength]. [[G444]]

###### 26
Brothers, [[G80]] consider [[G991]] [ the time of ] your [[G4771]] calling: [[G2821]] Not [[G3756]] many [of you] [[G4183]] [were] wise [[G4680]] by human standards; [[G2596]] not [[G3756]] many [were] [[G4183]] powerful; [[G1415]] not [[G3756]] many [were] [[G4183]] of noble birth. [[G2104]]

###### 27
But [[G235]] God [[G2316]] chose [[G1586]] the [[G3588]] foolish things [[G3474]] of the [[G3588]] world [[G2889]] to [[G2443]] shame [[G2617]] the [[G3588]] wise; [[G4680]] God [[G2316]] chose [[G1586]] the [[G3588]] weak things [[G772]] of the [[G3588]] world [[G2889]] to [[G2443]] shame [[G2617]] the [[G3588]] strong. [[G2478]]

###### 28
[He] [[G2316]] chose [[G1586]] the [[G3588]] lowly [[G36]] and [[G2532]] despised [[G1848]] things [[G3588]] of the [[G3588]] world, [[G2889]] and [[G2532]] the things that [[G3588]] are [[G1510]] not, [[G3361]] to [[G2443]] nullify [[G2673]] the things that [[G3588]] are, [[G1510]]

###### 29
so that [[G3704]] no [[G3361]] [one] [[G4561]] may boast [[G2744]] in [His] presence. [[G1799]]

###### 30
[It is] [[G1161]] because of [[G1537]] Him [that] [[G846]] you [[G4771]] are [[G1510]] in [[G1722]] Christ [[G5547]] Jesus, [[G2424]] who [[G3739]] has become [[G1096]] for us [[G1473]] wisdom [[G4678]] from [[G575]] God: [[G2316]] [our] righteousness, [[G1343]] holiness, [[G38]] and [[G2532]] redemption. [[G629]]

###### 31
Therefore, [[G2443]] as [[G2531]] it is written: [[G1125]] “{Let} him who [[G3588]] boasts [[G2744]] boast [[G2744]] in [[G1722]] [the] Lord.” [[G2962]]
