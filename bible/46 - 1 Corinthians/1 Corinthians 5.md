###### 1
{It is} actually [[G3654]] reported [that there is] [[G191]] sexual immorality [[G4202]] among [[G1722]] you, [[G4771]] and [[G2532]] [of a kind] [[G4202]] that is [[G5108]] intolerable even [[G3761]] among [[G1722]] pagans: [[G1484]] A man [[G5100]] has [[G2192]] [his] [[G3588]] father’s [[G3962]] wife. [[G1135]]

###### 2
And [[G2532]] you [[G4771]] are [[G1510]] proud! [[G5448]] Shouldn’t you [[G3780]] rather [[G3123]] have been stricken with grief [[G3996]] [and] [[G2443]] removed [[G142]] from [[G1537]] your [[G4771]] [fellowship] [[G3319]] the [man who] [[G3588]] did [[G4238]] this? [[G3778]]

###### 3
Although [[G1063]] I [[G1473]] am absent [ from you ] [[G548]] in body, [[G4983]] I am present [with you ] [[G3918]] in spirit, [[G4151]] and I have already pronounced judgment [[G2919]] on the [one] [[G3588]] [who] [[G3779]] did [[G2716]] this, [[G3778]] just as if [[G5613]] I were present. [[G3918]]

###### 4
[When] you [[G4771]] are gathered [[G4863]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] name [[G3686]] of [[G3588]] our [[G1473]] Lord [[G2962]] Jesus [[G2424]] and [[G2532]] I [am with you] [[G1699]] in spirit, [[G4151]] along with [[G4862]] the [[G3588]] power [[G1411]] of the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] Jesus, [[G2424]]

###### 5
hand [[G3860]] this man {over} [[G5108]] to Satan [[G4567]] for [[G1519]] [the] destruction [[G3639]] of the [[G3588]] flesh, [[G4561]] so that [[G2443]] [his] [[G3588]] spirit [[G4151]] may be saved [[G4982]] on [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] day [[G2250]] of the [[G3588]] Lord. [[G2962]]

###### 6
Your [[G4771]] boasting [[G2745]] [is] not [[G3756]] good. [[G2570]] Do you not know [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] a little [[G3398]] yeast [[G2219]] leavens [[G2220]] the [[G3588]] whole [[G3650]] batch [of dough]? [[G5445]]

###### 7
Get rid of [[G1571]] the [[G3588]] old [[G3820]] yeast, [[G2219]] that [[G2443]] you may be [[G1510]] a new [[G3501]] unleavened [[G106]] batch, [[G5445]] as [[G2531]] you really are. [[G1510]] For [[G1063]] Christ, [[G5547]] our [[G1473]] Passover lamb, [[G3957]] has been sacrificed. [[G2380]]

###### 8
Therefore [[G5620]] let us keep the feast, [[G1858]] not [[G3361]] with [[G1722]] [the] old [[G3820]] bread, leavened [[G2219]] with malice [[G2549]] and [[G2532]] wickedness, [[G4189]] but [[G235]] with [[G1722]] [the] unleavened [bread] [[G106]] of sincerity [[G1505]] and [[G2532]] of truth. [[G225]]

###### 9
I wrote [[G1125]] you [[G4771]] in [[G1722]] [my] [[G3588]] letter [[G1992]] not [[G3361]] to associate with [[G4874]] sexually immoral [people]. [[G4205]]

###### 10
I was not [[G3756]] [including ] [[G3843]] the [[G3588]] sexually immoral [[G4205]] of this [[G3778]] world, [[G2889]] or [[G2228]] the [[G3588]] greedy [[G4123]] and [[G2532]] swindlers, [[G727]] or [[G2228]] idolaters. [[G1496]] In that case [[G686]] you would have [[G3784]] to leave [[G1831]] [this] [[G3588]] world. [[G2889]]

###### 11
But [[G1161]] now [[G3568]] I am writing [[G1125]] you [[G4771]] not [[G3361]] to associate with [[G4874]] anyone [[G5100]] who claims to be [[G3687]] a brother [[G80]] [but] [[G1437]] is [[G1510]] sexually immoral [[G4205]] or [[G2228]] greedy, [[G4123]] an idolater [[G1496]] or [[G2228]] a verbal abuser, [[G3060]] a drunkard [[G3183]] or [[G2228]] a swindler. [[G727]] With [[G3588]] such a man [[G5108]] {do} not even [[G3366]] eat. [[G4906]]

###### 12
What [[G5101]] business of mine [is it] [[G1473]] to judge [[G2919]] those [[G3588]] outside [the church ]? [[G1854]] {Are} you [[G4771]] not [[G3780]] to judge [[G2919]] those [[G3588]] inside? [[G2080]]

###### 13
God [[G2316]] will judge [[G2919]] those [[G3588]] outside. [[G1854]] “Expel [[G1808]] the [[G3588]] wicked [man] [[G4190]] from [[G1537]] among you.” [[G4771]]
