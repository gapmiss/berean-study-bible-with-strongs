### 1
[If] any [[G5100]] of you [[G4771]] has [[G2192]] a grievance [[G4229]] against [[G4314]] another, [[G2087]] how dare [[G5111]] he go to law [[G2919]] before [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] unrighteous [[G94]] [instead of] [[G2532]] before [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] saints! [[G40]]

### 2
Do you not know [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] the [[G3588]] saints [[G40]] will judge [[G2919]] the [[G3588]] world? [[G2889]] And [[G2532]] if [[G1487]] you [[G4771]] are to judge [[G2919]] the [[G3588]] world, [[G2889]] are you not competent [[G370]] [ to judge ] trivial [[G1646]] cases? [[G2922]]

### 3
Do you not know [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] we will judge [[G2919]] angels? [[G32]] How much more [[G3386]] the things of this life! [[G982]]

### 4
So [[G3767]] if [[G1437]] you need [[G2192]] to settle [[G2922]] everyday matters, [[G982]] do you appoint [as judges] [[G2523]] those [[G3778]] of no standing [[G1848]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] church? [[G1577]]

### 5
I say this [[G3004]] to your [[G4771]] shame. [[G1791]] Is there [[G1762]] really [[G3779]] no [[G3756]] one [[G3762]] among [[G1722]] you [[G4771]] wise [enough] [[G4680]] to arbitrate [[G1252]] between [[G3319]] his [[G846]] brothers? [[G80]]

### 6
Instead, [[G235]] [one] brother [[G80]] goes to law [[G2919]] against [[G3326]] [another], [[G80]] and [[G2532]] this [[G3778]] in front of [[G1909]] unbelievers! [[G571]]

### 7
The very fact that [[G3754]] you have [[G2192]] lawsuits [[G2917]] among [[G3326]] you [[G1438]] means [[G1510]] you [[G4771]] {are} thoroughly [[G3654]] defeated [[G2275]] already. [[G2235]] Why [[G1223]] not [[G3780]] rather [[G3123]] be wronged? [[G91]] Why [[G1223]] not [[G3780]] rather [[G3123]] be cheated? [[G650]]

### 8
Instead, [[G235]] you yourselves [[G4771]] cheat [[G650]] and [[G2532]] do wrong, [[G91]] even [[G2532]] [against your own] [[G3778]] brothers! [[G80]]

### 9
Do you not know [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] [the] wicked [[G94]] will not inherit [[G2816]] [the] kingdom [[G932]] of God? [[G2316]] {Do} not [[G3361]] be deceived: [[G4105]] Neither [[G3777]] the sexually immoral, [[G4205]] nor [[G3777]] idolaters, [[G1496]] nor [[G3777]] adulterers, [[G3432]] nor [[G3777]] men who submit to [[G3120]] or [[G3777]] perform homosexual acts, [[G733]]

### 10
nor [[G3777]] thieves, [[G2812]] nor [[G3777]] the greedy, [[G4123]] nor [[G3756]] drunkards, [[G3183]] nor [[G3756]] verbal abusers, [[G3060]] nor [[G3756]] swindlers, [[G727]] will inherit [[G2816]] [the] kingdom [[G932]] of God. [[G2316]]

### 11
And [[G2532]] that [is what] [[G3778]] some [of] [[G5100]] you were. [[G1510]] But [[G235]] you were washed, [[G628]] you were sanctified, [[G37]] you were justified, [[G1344]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] name [[G3686]] of the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ [[G5547]] and [[G2532]] by [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] Spirit [[G4151]] of [[G3588]] our [[G1473]] God. [[G2316]]

### 12
“Everything [[G3956]] is permissible [[G1832]] for me,” [[G1473]] but [[G235]] not [[G3756]] everything [[G3956]] is beneficial. [[G4851]] “Everything [[G3956]] is permissible [[G1832]] for me,” [[G1473]] but [[G235]] I [[G1473]] will not be mastered [[G1850]] by [[G5259]] anything. [[G5100]]

### 13
“Food [[G1033]] for the [[G3588]] stomach [[G2836]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] stomach [[G2836]] for food,” [[G1033]] but [[G1161]] God [[G2316]] will destroy [[G2673]] them [[G3778]] both. [[G2532]] The [[G3588]] body [is] [[G4983]] not [intended] [[G3756]] for sexual immorality, [[G4202]] but [[G235]] for the [[G3588]] Lord, [[G2962]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] for the [[G3588]] body. [[G4983]]

### 14
By [[G1223]] His [[G846]] power [[G1411]] God [[G2316]] raised [[G1453]] the [[G3588]] Lord {from the dead}, [[G2962]] and [[G2532]] He will raise us [also]. [[G1825]]

### 15
Do you not know [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] your [[G4771]] bodies [[G4983]] are [[G1510]] members [[G3196]] of Christ? [[G5547]] Shall I then take [[G142]] the [[G3588]] members [[G3196]] of Christ [[G5547]] and unite [them] [[G4160]] with a prostitute? [[G4204]] Never! [[G1096]]

### 16
Or [[G2228]] don’t you know [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] he who [[G3588]] unites himself [[G2853]] with a prostitute [[G4204]] is [[G1510]] one [with her] [[G1520]] in body? [[G4983]] For [[G1063]] it is said, [[G5346]] “The [[G3588]] two [[G1417]] will become [[G1510]] one [[G1520]] flesh.” [[G4561]]

### 17
But [[G1161]] he who [[G3588]] unites himself [[G2853]] with the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] is [[G1510]] one [with Him] [[G1520]] [in] spirit. [[G4151]]

### 18
Flee from [[G5343]] sexual immorality. [[G4202]] Every [other] [[G3956]] sin [[G265]] a man [[G444]] can commit [[G4160]] is [[G1510]] outside [[G1622]] [his] [[G3588]] body, [[G4983]] but [[G1161]] he who [[G3588]] sins sexually [[G4203]] sins [[G264]] against [[G1519]] [his] [[G3588]] own [[G2398]] body. [[G4983]]

### 19
Do you not know [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] your [[G4771]] body [[G4983]] is [[G1510]] a temple [[G3485]] of the [[G3588]] Holy [[G40]] Spirit [[G4151]] [who is] in [[G1722]] you, [[G4771]] whom [[G3739]] you have [received] [[G2192]] from [[G575]] God? [[G2316]] You are [[G1510]] not [[G3756]] your own; [[G1438]]

### 20
you were bought [[G59]] at a price. [[G5092]] Therefore [[G1211]] glorify [[G1392]] God [[G2316]] with [[G1722]] your [[G4771]] body. [[G4983]]
