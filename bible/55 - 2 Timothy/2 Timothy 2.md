[[2 Timothy 1|←]] • [[2 Timothy 3|→]]

### 1
You [[G4771]] therefore, [[G3767]] my [[G1473]] child, [[G5043]] be strong [[G1743]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] grace [[G5485]] that [is] [[G3588]] in [[G1722]] Christ [[G5547]] Jesus. [[G2424]]

### 2
And [[G2532]] the things that [[G3739]] you have heard [[G191]] me [say] [[G1473]] among [[G1223]] many [[G4183]] witnesses, [[G3144]] entrust [[G3908]] these [[G3778]] to faithful [[G4103]] men [[G444]] who [[G3748]] will be [[G1510]] qualified [[G2425]] to teach [[G1321]] others [[G2087]] as well. [[G2532]]

### 3
Join me in suffering, [[G4777]] like [[G5613]] [a] good [[G2570]] soldier [[G4757]] of Christ [[G5547]] Jesus. [[G2424]]

### 4
A soldier [[G4754]] refrains from [[G3762]] entangling himself [[G1707]] in [[G3588]] [civilian] [[G979]] affairs, [[G4230]] in order [[G2443]] to please [[G700]] the [one who] [[G3588]] enlisted him. [[G4758]]

### 5
Likewise, [[G1161]] a [[G5100]] contender [[G118]] does not receive the crown [[G4737]] unless [[G1437]] he competes [[G118]] according to the rules. [[G3545]]

### 6
The [[G3588]] hardworking [[G2872]] farmer [[G1092]] should be [[G1163]] the first [[G4412]] to receive his share [[G3335]] of the [[G3588]] crops. [[G2590]]

### 7
Consider [[G3539]] what [[G3739]] I am saying, [[G3004]] for [[G1063]] the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] will give [[G1325]] you [[G4771]] insight [[G4907]] into [[G1722]] all things. [[G3956]]

### 8
Remember [[G3421]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ, [[G5547]] raised [[G1453]] from [[G1537]] [the] dead, [[G3498]] descended [[G4690]] from David, [[G1138]] as proclaimed by [[G2596]] my [[G1473]] gospel, [[G2098]]

### 9
for [[G1722]] which [[G3739]] I suffer [[G2553]] to the extent of [[G3360]] being chained [[G1199]] like [[G5613]] a criminal. [[G2557]] But [[G235]] the [[G3588]] word [[G3056]] of God [[G2316]] cannot be chained! [[G1210]]

### 10
For this reason [[G1223]] I endure [[G5278]] all things [[G3956]] for the sake of [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] elect, [[G1588]] so that [[G2443]] they [[G846]] too [[G2532]] may obtain [[G5177]] [the] salvation [[G4991]] that [is] [[G3588]] in [[G1722]] Christ [[G5547]] Jesus, [[G2424]] with [[G3326]] eternal [[G166]] glory. [[G1391]]

### 11
[This is a] trustworthy [[G4103]] saying: [[G3056]] If [[G1487]] we died [with Him], [[G4880]] we will also live [with Him]; [[G4800]]

### 12
if [[G1487]] we endure, [[G5278]] we will also reign [with Him]; [[G4821]] if [[G1487]] we deny [Him], [[G720]] He will also deny [[G720]] us; [[G1473]]

### 13
if [[G1487]] we are faithless, [[G569]] He [[G1565]] remains [[G3306]] faithful, [[G4103]] for [[G1063]] He cannot [[G1410]] deny [[G720]] Himself. [[G1438]]

### 14
Remind [ the believers ] [[G5279]] of these things, [[G3778]] charging [them] [[G1263]] before [[G1799]] God [[G2316]] to avoid [[G3361]] quarreling over words; [[G3054]] [this is] [[G1909]] in no way [[G3762]] profitable, [[G5539]] [and leads] [[G1909]] [its] [[G3588]] listeners [[G191]] to ruin. [[G2692]]

### 15
Make every effort [[G4704]] to present [[G3936]] yourself [[G4572]] approved [[G1384]] to God, [[G2316]] [an] unashamed [[G422]] workman [[G2040]] who accurately handles [[G3718]] the [[G3588]] word [[G3056]] of truth. [[G225]]

### 16
But [[G1161]] avoid [[G4026]] irreverent [[G952]] [and] empty chatter, [[G2757]] [which] [[G1063]] will [only] lead [[G4298]] to [[G1909]] more [[G4119]] ungodliness, [[G763]]

### 17
and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] talk [[G3056]] of [such men] [[G846]] will [[G2192]] spread [[G3542]] like [[G5613]] gangrene. [[G1044]] Among [them] [[G3739]] are [[G1510]] Hymenaeus [[G5211]] and [[G2532]] Philetus, [[G5372]]

### 18
who [[G3748]] have deviated [[G795]] from [[G4012]] the [[G3588]] truth. [[G225]] They say that [[G3004]] the [[G3588]] resurrection [[G386]] has already occurred, [[G1096]] and [[G2532]] they undermine [[G396]] the [[G3588]] faith [[G4102]] of some. [[G5100]]

### 19
Nevertheless, [[G3305]] God’s [[G2316]] firm [[G4731]] foundation [[G2310]] stands, [[G2476]] bearing [[G2192]] this [[G3778]] seal: [[G4973]] “[The] Lord [[G2962]] knows [[G1097]] those who [[G3588]] are [[G1510]] His,” [[G846]] and, [[G2532]] “Everyone [[G3956]] who [[G3588]] calls on [[G3687]] the [[G3588]] name [[G3686]] of the Lord [[G2962]] must turn away [[G868]] from [[G575]] iniquity.” [[G93]]

### 20
A large [[G3173]] house [[G3614]] contains [[G1510]] not [[G3756]] only [[G3440]] vessels [[G4632]] of gold [[G5552]] and [[G2532]] silver, [[G693]] but [[G235]] also [[G2532]] of wood [[G3585]] and [[G2532]] clay. [[G3749]] Some [[G3739]] indeed [[G3303]] [are] for [[G1519]] honorable [use], [[G5092]] but [[G1161]] others [[G3739]] [are] for [[G1519]] common [use]. [[G819]]

### 21
So [[G3767]] if [[G1437]] anyone [[G5100]] cleanses [[G1571]] himself [[G1438]] of [[G575]] what is unfit, [[G3778]] he will be [[G1510]] a vessel [[G4632]] for [[G1519]] honor: [[G5092]] sanctified, [[G37]] useful [[G2173]] to the [[G3588]] Master, [[G1203]] [and] prepared [[G2090]] for [[G1519]] every [[G3956]] good [[G18]] work. [[G2041]]

### 22
Flee from [[G5343]] youthful [[G3512]] passions [[G1939]] and [[G1161]] pursue [[G1377]] righteousness, [[G1343]] faith, [[G4102]] love, [[G26]] [and] peace, [[G1515]] along with [[G3326]] those who [[G3588]] call on [[G1941]] the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] out of [[G1537]] a pure [[G2513]] heart. [[G2588]]

### 23
But [[G1161]] reject [[G3868]] foolish [[G3474]] and [[G2532]] ignorant [[G521]] speculation, [[G2214]] for you know [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] it breeds [[G1080]] quarreling. [[G3163]]

### 24
And [[G1161]] a servant [[G1401]] of [the] Lord [[G2962]] must [[G1163]] not [[G3756]] be quarrelsome, [[G3164]] but [[G235]] he must be [[G1510]] kind [[G2261]] to [[G4314]] everyone, [[G3956]] able to teach, [[G1317]] [and] forbearing. [[G420]]

### 25
[He must] gently [[G4240]] reprove [[G3811]] those who [[G3588]] oppose [him], [[G475]] in the hope that [[G3361]] God [[G2316]] may grant [[G1325]] them [[G846]] repentance [[G3341]] leading to [[G1519]] a knowledge [[G1922]] of [the] truth. [[G225]]

### 26
Then [[G2532]] they will come to their senses [[G366]] [and escape] [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] snare [[G3803]] of the [[G3588]] devil, [[G1228]] [who] [[G846]] has taken them captive [[G2221]] to [[G1519]] his [[G1565]] will. [[G2307]]
