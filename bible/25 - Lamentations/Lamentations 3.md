###### 1
I [[H589]] am the man [[H1397]] who has seen [[H7200]] affliction [[H6040]] under the rod [[H7626]] of [God’s] wrath. [[H5678]]

###### 2
He has driven me away [[H5090]] and made me walk [[H1980]] in darkness [[H2822]] instead of [[H3808]] light. [[H216]]

###### 3
Indeed, [[H389]] He keeps turning [[H7725]] His hand [[H3027]] [against me] all day long. [[H3605]]

###### 4
He has worn away [[H1086]] my flesh [[H1320]] and skin; [[H5785]] He has shattered [[H7665]] my bones. [[H6106]]

###### 5
He has besieged [[H1129]] me [[H5921]] and surrounded me [[H5362]] with bitterness [[H7219]] and hardship. [[H8513]]

###### 6
He has made me dwell [[H3427]] in darkness [[H4285]] like those dead [[H4191]] for ages. [[H5769]]

###### 7
He has walled me in [[H1443]] so I cannot [[H3808]] escape; [[H3318]] He has weighed me down [[H3513]] with chains. [[H5178]]

###### 8
Even [[H1571]] when [[H3588]] I cry out [[H2199]] and plead for help, [[H7768]] He shuts out [[H5640]] my prayer. [[H8605]]

###### 9
He has barred [[H1443]] my ways [[H1870]] with cut stones; [[H1496]] He has made my paths [[H5410]] crooked. [[H5753]]

###### 10
He [[H1931]] is a bear [[H1677]] lying in wait, [[H693]] a lion [[H738]] in hiding. [[H4565]]

###### 11
He forced me off [[H5493]] my path [[H1870]] and tore me to pieces; [[H6582]] He left me [[H7760]] without help. [[H8076]]

###### 12
He bent [[H1869]] His bow [[H7198]] and set me [[H5324]] as the target [[H4307]] for His arrow. [[H2671]]

###### 13
He pierced [[H935]] my kidneys [[H3629]] with His arrows. [[H1121]]

###### 14
I am [[H1961]] a laughingstock [[H7814]] to all [[H3605]] my people; [[H5971]] they mock me in song [[H5058]] all day long. [[H3605]]

###### 15
He has filled [[H7646]] me with bitterness; [[H4844]] He has intoxicated me [[H7301]] with wormwood. [[H3939]]

###### 16
He has ground [[H1638]] my teeth [[H8127]] with gravel [[H2687]] and trampled me [[H3728]] in the dust. [[H665]]

###### 17
My soul [[H5315]] has been deprived [[H2186]] of peace; [[H7965]] I have forgotten [[H5382]] what prosperity is. [[H2896]]

###### 18
So I say, [[H559]] “My strength [[H5331]] has perished [[H6]] along with my hope [[H8431]] from the LORD.” [[H3068]]

###### 19
Remember [[H2142]] my affliction [[H6040]] and wandering, [[H4788]] the wormwood [[H3939]] and the gall. [[H7219]]

###### 20
Surely [[H2142]] my soul [[H5315]] remembers [[H2142]] and is humbled [[H7743]] within me. [[H5921]]

###### 21
Yet I call [[H7725]] this [[H2063]] to [[H413]] mind, [[H3820]] and therefore [[H5921]] I have hope: [[H3176]]

###### 22
Because of [[H3588]] the LORD’s [[H3068]] loving devotion [[H2617]] we are not [[H3808]] consumed, [[H8552]] for [[H3588]] His compassions [[H7356]] never [[H3808]] fail. [[H3615]]

###### 23
They are new every morning; [[H2319]] great [[H7227]] is Your faithfulness! [[H530]]

###### 24
“The LORD [[H3068]] is my portion,” [[H2506]] says [[H559]] my soul, [[H5315]] “therefore [[H5921]] I will hope [[H3176]] in Him.” 

###### 25
The LORD [[H3068]] is good [[H2896]] to those who wait for Him, [[H6960]] to the soul [[H5315]] who seeks Him. [[H1875]]

###### 26
It is good [[H2896]] to wait [[H2342]] quietly [[H1748]] for the salvation [[H8668]] of the LORD. [[H3068]]

###### 27
It is good [[H2896]] for a man [[H1397]] to bear [[H5375]] the yoke [[H5923]] while he is still young. [[H5271]]

###### 28
Let him sit [[H3427]] alone [[H910]] in silence, [[H1826]] for [[H3588]] God has disciplined [[H5190]] him. [[H5921]]

###### 29
Let him bury [[H5414]] his face [[H6310]] in the dust— [[H6083]] perhaps [[H194]] there is [[H3426]] still hope. [[H8615]]

###### 30
Let him offer [[H5414]] his cheek [[H3895]] to the one who would strike him; [[H5221]] let him be filled [[H7646]] with reproach. [[H2781]]

###### 31
For [[H3588]] the Lord [[H136]] will not [[H3808]] cast us off [[H2186]] forever. [[H5769]]

###### 32
Even [[H3588]] if [[H518]] He causes grief, [[H3013]] He will show compassion [[H7355]] according to His abundant [[H7230]] loving devotion. [[H2617]]

###### 33
For [[H3588]] He does not [[H3808]] willingly [[H3820]] afflict [[H6031]] or grieve [[H3013]] the sons [[H1121]] of men. [[H376]]

###### 34
To crush [[H1792]] underfoot [[H8478]] all [[H3605]] the prisoners [[H615]] of the land, [[H776]]

###### 35
to deny [[H5186]] a man [[H1397]] justice [[H4941]] before [[H5048]] the Most High, [[H5945]]

###### 36
to subvert [[H5791]] a man [[H120]] in his lawsuit— [[H7379]] of these the Lord [[H136]] does not [[H3808]] approve. [[H7200]]

###### 37
Who [[H4310]] has spoken [[H559]] and it came to pass, [[H1961]] unless [[H3808]] the Lord [[H136]] has ordained it? [[H6680]]

###### 38
Do not [[H3808]] both adversity [[H7451]] and good [[H2896]] come [[H3318]] from the mouth [[H6310]] of the Most High? [[H5945]]

###### 39
Why [[H4100]] should any mortal [[H2416]] man [[H120]] complain, [[H596]] in view of [[H5921]] [his] [[H1397]] sins? [[H2399]]

###### 40
Let us examine [[H2664]] and test [[H2713]] our ways, [[H1870]] and turn back [[H7725]] to [[H5704]] the LORD. [[H3068]]

###### 41
Let us lift up [[H5375]] our hearts [[H3824]] and hands [[H3709]] to [[H413]] God [[H410]] in heaven: [[H8064]]

###### 42
“We [[H5168]] have sinned [[H6586]] and rebelled; [[H4784]] You [[H859]] have not [[H3808]] forgiven.” [[H5545]]

###### 43
You have covered [[H5526]] Yourself in anger [[H639]] and pursued us; [[H7291]] You have killed [[H2026]] without [[H3808]] pity. [[H2550]]

###### 44
You have covered Yourself [[H5526]] with a cloud [[H6051]] that no prayer [[H8605]] can pass through. [[H5674]]

###### 45
You have made us [[H7760]] scum [[H5501]] and refuse [[H3973]] among [[H7130]] the nations. [[H5971]]

###### 46
All [[H3605]] our enemies [[H341]] open [[H6475]] their mouths [[H6310]] against us. [[H5921]]

###### 47
Panic [[H6343]] and pitfall [[H6354]] have come upon us— [[H1961]] devastation [[H7612]] and destruction. [[H7667]]

###### 48
Streams [[H6388]] of tears [[H4325]] flow [[H3381]] from my eyes [[H5869]] over [[H5921]] the destruction [[H7667]] of the daughter [[H1323]] of my people. [[H5971]]

###### 49
My eyes [[H5869]] overflow [[H5064]] unceasingly, [[H3808]] without [[H369]] relief, [[H2014]]

###### 50
until [[H5704]] the LORD [[H3068]] looks down [[H8259]] from heaven [[H8064]] and sees. [[H7200]]

###### 51
My eyes [[H5869]] bring grief [[H5953]] to my soul [[H5315]] because of all [[H3605]] the daughters [[H1323]] of my city. [[H5892]]

###### 52
Without cause [[H2600]] my enemies [[H341]] hunted [[H6679]] me like a bird. [[H6833]]

###### 53
They dropped [[H6789]] me alive [[H2416]] into a pit [[H953]] and cast [[H3034]] stones [[H68]] at me. 

###### 54
The waters [[H4325]] flowed [[H6687]] over [[H5921]] my head, [[H7218]] and I thought [[H559]] I was going to die. [[H1504]]

###### 55
I called on [[H7121]] Your name, [[H8034]] O LORD, [[H3068]] out of the depths [[H8482]] of the Pit. [[H953]]

###### 56
You heard [[H8085]] my plea: [[H6963]] “Do not [[H408]] ignore [[H5956]] my cry [[H7775]] for relief.” [[H7309]]

###### 57
You drew near [[H7126]] when [[H3117]] I called on You; [[H7121]] You said, [[H559]] “Do not [[H408]] be afraid.” [[H3372]]

###### 58
You defend [[H7378]] my [[H5315]] cause, [[H7379]] O Lord; [[H136]] You redeem [[H1350]] my life. [[H2416]]

###### 59
You have seen, [[H7200]] O LORD, [[H3068]] the wrong done to me; [[H5792]] uphold [[H8199]] my cause. [[H4941]]

###### 60
You see [[H7200]] all [[H3605]] their malice, [[H5360]] all [[H3605]] their plots against me. [[H4284]]

###### 61
O LORD, [[H3068]] You have heard [[H8085]] their insults, [[H2781]] all [[H3605]] their plots [[H4284]] against me— [[H5921]]

###### 62
the slander [[H8193]] and murmuring [[H1902]] of my opponents [[H6965]] against me [[H5921]] all day long. [[H3605]]

###### 63
When they sit [[H3427]] and when they rise, [[H7012]] see how [[H5027]] they mock me in song. [[H4485]]

###### 64
You will pay them back [[H7725]] what they deserve, [[H1576]] O LORD, [[H3068]] according to the work [[H4639]] of their hands. [[H3027]]

###### 65
You will give [[H5414]] them [[H1992]] hardness [[H4044]] of heart; [[H3820]] may Your curse be [[H8381]] upon them! [[H1992]]

###### 66
You will pursue them [[H7291]] in anger [[H639]] and exterminate them [[H8045]] from under [[H8478]] the heavens [[H8064]] of the LORD. [[H3068]]
