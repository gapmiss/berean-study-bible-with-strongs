### 1
How [[H349]] the Lord [[H136]] has covered [[H5743]] the Daughter [[H1323]] of Zion [[H6726]] with His cloud of anger! [[H639]] He has cast [[H7993]] the glory [[H8597]] of Israel [[H3478]] from heaven [[H8064]] to earth. [[H776]] He has abandoned [[H3808]] His footstool [[H1916]] in the day [[H3117]] of His anger. [[H639]]

### 2
Without [[H3808]] pity [[H2550]] the Lord [[H136]] has swallowed up [[H1104]] all [[H3605]] the dwellings [[H4999]] of Jacob. [[H3290]] In His wrath [[H5678]] He has demolished [[H2040]] the fortified cities [[H4013]] of the Daughter [[H1323]] of Judah. [[H3063]] He brought [[H5060]] to the ground [[H776]] and defiled [[H2490]] her kingdom [[H4467]] and its princes. [[H8269]]

### 3
He has cut off [[H1438]] every [[H3605]] horn [[H7161]] of Israel [[H3478]] in [His] fierce [[H2750]] anger [[H639]] and withdrawn [[H7725]] His right hand [[H3225]] at the approach [[H6440]] of the enemy. [[H341]] He has burned [[H1197]] in Jacob [[H3290]] like a flaming [[H3852]] fire [[H784]] that consumes [[H398]] all around it. [[H5439]]

### 4
He has bent [[H1869]] His bow [[H7198]] like an enemy; [[H341]] His right hand [[H3225]] is positioned. [[H5324]] Like a foe [[H6862]] He has killed [[H2026]] all [[H3605]] who were pleasing [[H4261]] to the eye; [[H5869]] He has poured out [[H8210]] His wrath [[H2534]] like fire [[H784]] on the tent [[H168]] of the Daughter [[H1323]] of Zion. [[H6726]]

### 5
The Lord [[H136]] is [[H1961]] like an enemy; [[H341]] He has swallowed up [[H1104]] Israel. [[H3478]] He swallowed up [[H1104]] all [[H3605]] her palaces [[H759]] and destroyed [[H7843]] her strongholds. [[H4013]] He has multiplied [[H7235]] mourning [[H8386]] and lamentation [[H592]] in the Daughter [[H1323]] of Judah. [[H3063]]

### 6
He has laid waste [[H2554]] to His tabernacle [[H7900]] like a garden booth; [[H1588]] He has destroyed [[H7843]] His place of meeting. [[H4150]] The LORD [[H3068]] has made Zion forget [[H7911]] her appointed feasts [[H4150]] and Sabbaths. [[H7676]] In His fierce anger [[H2195]] He has despised [[H5006]] [both] king [[H4428]] and priest. [[H3548]]

### 7
The Lord [[H136]] has rejected [[H2186]] His altar; [[H4196]] He has abandoned [[H5010]] His sanctuary; [[H4720]] He has handed the walls [[H2346]] of her palaces [[H759]] over to [[H5462]] the enemy. [[H341]] They have raised [[H5414]] a shout [[H6963]] in the house [[H1004]] of the LORD [[H3068]] as on the day [[H3117]] of an appointed feast. [[H4150]]

### 8
The LORD [[H3068]] determined [[H2803]] to destroy [[H7843]] the wall [[H2346]] of the Daughter [[H1323]] of Zion. [[H6726]] He stretched out [[H5186]] a measuring line [[H6957]] and did not [[H3808]] withdraw [[H7725]] His hand [[H3027]] from destroying. [[H1104]] He made the ramparts [[H2426]] and walls [[H2346]] lament; [[H56]] together [[H3162]] they waste away. [[H535]]

### 9
Her gates [[H8179]] have sunk [[H2883]] into the ground; [[H776]] He has destroyed [[H6]] and shattered [[H7665]] their bars. [[H1280]] Her king [[H4428]] and her princes [[H8269]] are [exiled] among the nations, [[H1471]] the law [[H8451]] is no more, [[H369]] and even [[H1571]] her prophets [[H5030]] find [[H4672]] no [[H3808]] vision [[H2377]] from the LORD. [[H3068]]

### 10
The elders [[H2205]] of the Daughter [[H1323]] of Zion [[H6726]] sit [[H3427]] on the ground [[H776]] in silence. [[H1826]] They have thrown [[H5927]] dust [[H6083]] on [[H5921]] their heads [[H7218]] and put on [[H2296]] sackcloth. [[H8242]] The young women [[H1330]] of Jerusalem [[H3389]] have bowed [[H3381]] their heads [[H7218]] to the ground. [[H776]]

### 11
My eyes [[H5869]] fail [[H3615]] from weeping; [[H1832]] I am churning [[H2560]] within. [[H4578]] My heart [[H3516]] is poured out [[H8210]] in grief [[H776]] over [[H5921]] the destruction [[H7667]] of the daughter [[H1323]] of my people, [[H5971]] because children [[H5768]] and infants [[H3243]] faint [[H5848]] in the streets [[H7339]] of the city. [[H7151]]

### 12
They cry out [[H559]] to their mothers: [[H517]] “Where [[H346]] is the grain [[H1715]] and wine?” [[H3196]] as they faint [[H5848]] like the wounded [[H2491]] in the streets [[H7339]] of the city, [[H5892]] as their lives [[H5315]] fade away [[H8210]] in [[H413]] the arms [[H2436]] of their mothers. [[H517]]

### 13
What [[H4100]] can I say for you? [[H5749]] To  what [[H4100]] can I compare you, [[H1819]] O daughter [[H1323]] of Jerusalem? [[H3389]] To  what [[H4100]] can I liken you, [[H7737]] that I may console you, [[H5162]] O virgin [[H1330]] Daughter [[H1323]] of Zion? [[H6726]] For [[H3588]] your wound [[H7667]] is as deep [[H1419]] as the sea. [[H3220]] Who [[H4310]] can ever heal you? [[H7495]]

### 14
The visions [[H2372]] of your prophets [[H5030]] were empty [[H7723]] and deceptive; [[H8602]] they did not [[H3808]] expose [[H1540]] your guilt [[H5771]] to ward off [[H7725]] your captivity. [[H7622]] The oracles [[H4864]] they saw [[H2372]] for you  were empty [[H7723]] and misleading. [[H4065]]

### 15
All [[H3605]] who pass by [[H5674]] clap [[H5606]] their hands [[H3709]] at you [in scorn]. [[H5921]] They hiss [[H8319]] and shake [[H5128]] their heads [[H7218]] at [[H5921]] the Daughter [[H1323]] of Jerusalem: [[H3389]] “Is this [[H2063]] the city [[H5892]] that was called [[H559]] the perfection [[H3632]] of beauty, [[H3308]] the joy [[H4885]] of the whole [[H3605]] earth?” [[H776]]

### 16
All [[H3605]] your enemies [[H341]] open [[H6475]] their mouths [[H6310]] against you. [[H5921]] They hiss [[H8319]] and gnash [[H2786]] their teeth, [[H8127]] saying, [[H559]] “We have swallowed her up. [[H1104]] This [[H2088]] is the day [[H3117]] for which we have waited. [[H6960]] We have lived [[H4672]] to see it!” [[H7200]]

### 17
The LORD [[H3068]] has done [[H6213]] what [[H834]] He planned; [[H2161]] He has accomplished [[H1214]] His decree, [[H565]] which [[H834]] He ordained [[H6680]] in days [[H3117]] of old. [[H6924]] He has overthrown you [[H2040]] without [[H3808]] pity; [[H2550]] He has let the enemy [[H341]] gloat [[H8055]] over you [[H5921]] and exalted [[H7311]] the horn [[H7161]] of your foes. [[H6862]]

### 18
The hearts [of the people] [[H3820]] cry out [[H6817]] to [[H413]] the Lord. [[H136]] O wall [[H2346]] of the Daughter [[H1323]] of Zion, [[H6726]] let your tears [[H1832]] run down [[H3381]] like a river [[H5158]] day [[H3119]] and night. [[H3915]] Give [[H5414]] yourself no [[H408]] relief, [[H6314]] and your eyes [[H5869]] no [[H408]] rest. [[H1826]]

### 19
Arise, [[H6965]] cry out [[H7442]] in the night [[H3915]] from the first [[H7218]] watch of the night. [[H821]] Pour out [[H8210]] your heart [[H3820]] like water [[H4325]] in [[H5227]] the presence [[H6440]] of the Lord. [[H136]] Lift up [[H5375]] your hands [[H3709]] to Him [[H413]] for [[H5921]] the lives [[H5315]] of your children [[H5768]] who are fainting [[H5848]] from hunger [[H7458]] on the corner [[H7218]] of every [[H3605]] street. [[H2351]]

### 20
Look, [[H7200]] O LORD, [[H3068]] and consider: [[H5027]] Whom [[H4310]] have You [ever] treated [[H5953]] like this? [[H3541]] Should women [[H802]] eat [[H398]] their offspring, [[H6529]] the infants [[H5768]] they have nurtured? [[H2949]] Should priests [[H3548]] and prophets [[H5030]] be killed [[H2026]] in the sanctuary [[H4720]] of the Lord? [[H136]]

### 21
Both young [[H5288]] and old [[H2205]] lie together [[H7901]] in the dust [[H776]] of the streets. [[H2351]] My young men [[H970]] and maidens [[H1330]] have fallen [[H5307]] by the sword. [[H2719]] You have slain [them] [[H2026]] in the day [[H3117]] of Your anger; [[H639]] You have slaughtered [them] [[H2873]] without [[H3808]] compassion. [[H2550]]

### 22
You summoned [[H7121]] my attackers [[H4032]] on every side, [[H5439]] as for an appointed feast [[H4150]] day. [[H3117]] In the Day [[H3117]] of the LORD’s [[H3068]] anger [[H639]] no [[H3808]] one escaped [[H6412]] or survived. [[H8300]] My enemy [[H341]] has destroyed [[H3615]] those [[H834]] I nurtured [[H2946]] and reared. [[H7235]]
