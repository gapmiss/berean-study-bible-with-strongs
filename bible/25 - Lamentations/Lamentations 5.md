# Lamentations 5

[[Lamentations 4|←]] • [[Ezekiel 1|→]]

---

###### 1
Remember, [[H2142]] O LORD, [[H3068]] what [[H4100]] has happened to us. [[H1961]] Look [[H5027]] and see [[H7200]] our disgrace! [[H2781]]

###### 2
Our inheritance [[H5159]] has been turned over [[H2015]] to strangers, [[H2114]] our houses [[H1004]] to foreigners. [[H5237]]

###### 3
We have become [[H1961]] fatherless [[H369]] orphans; [[H3490]] our mothers [[H517]] are widows. [[H490]]

###### 4
We must buy [[H3701]] the water [[H4325]] we drink; [[H8354]] our wood [[H6086]] comes [[H935]] at a price. [[H4242]]

###### 5
We are closely [[H5921]] pursued; [[H7291]] we are weary [[H3021]] [and find] no [[H3808]] rest. [[H5117]]

###### 6
We submitted [[H5414]] to Egypt [[H4713]] [and] Assyria, [[H804]] to get enough [[H7646]] food. [[H3899]]

###### 7
Our fathers [[H1]] sinned [[H2398]] [and are] no more, [[H369]] but we [[H587]] bear [[H5445]] their punishment. [[H5771]]

###### 8
Slaves [[H5650]] rule over us; [[H4910]] [there is] no one [[H369]] to deliver us [[H6561]] from their hands. [[H3027]]

###### 9
We get [[H935]] our bread [[H3899]] at the risk of our lives [[H5315]] because of [[H6440]] the sword [[H2719]] in the wilderness. [[H4057]]

###### 10
Our skin [[H5785]] is as hot [[H3648]] as an oven [[H8574]] because of [[H6440]] the burning [[H2152]] of famine. [[H7458]]

###### 11
Women [[H802]] have been ravished [[H6031]] in Zion, [[H6726]] virgins [[H1330]] in the cities [[H5892]] of Judah. [[H3063]]

###### 12
Princes [[H8269]] have been hung up [[H8518]] by their hands; [[H3027]] elders [[H2205]] receive no [[H3808]] respect. [[H6440]]

###### 13
Young men [[H970]] toil [[H5375]] at millstones; [[H2911]] boys [[H5288]] stagger [[H3782]] under loads of wood. [[H6086]]

###### 14
The elders [[H2205]] have left [[H7673]] the city gate; [[H8179]] the young men [[H970]] [have stopped] their music. [[H5058]]

###### 15
Joy [[H4885]] has left [[H7673]] our hearts; [[H3820]] our dancing [[H4234]] has turned [[H2015]] to mourning. [[H60]]

###### 16
The crown [[H5850]] has fallen [[H5307]] from our head. [[H7218]] Woe to us, [[H188]] for [[H3588]] we have sinned! [[H2398]]

###### 17
Because of [[H5921]] this, [[H2088]] our hearts [[H3820]] are [[H1961]] faint; [[H1739]] because of [[H5921]] these, [[H428]] our eyes [[H5869]] grow dim: [[H2821]]

###### 18
because of [[H5921]] Mount [[H2022]] Zion, [[H6726]] which lies desolate, [[H8074]] haunted [[H1980]] by the jackals. [[H7776]]

###### 19
You, [[H859]] O LORD, [[H3069]] reign [[H3427]] forever; [[H5769]] Your throne [[H3678]] endures from generation [[H1755]] to generation. [[H1755]]

###### 20
Why [[H4100]] have You forgotten us [[H7911]] forever? [[H5331]] Why have You forsaken us [[H5800]] for so long? [[H753]]

###### 21
Restore [[H7725]] us to Yourself, [[H413]] O LORD, [[H3068]] so we may return; [[H7725]] renew [[H2318]] our days [[H3117]] as of old, [[H6924]]

###### 22
unless [[H3588]] You have utterly rejected us [[H3988]] and remain angry [[H7107]] with us [[H5921]] beyond measure. [[H5704]]
