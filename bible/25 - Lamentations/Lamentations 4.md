[[Lamentations 3|←]] • [[Lamentations 5|→]]

###### 1
How [[H349]] the gold [[H2091]] has become tarnished, [[H6004]] the pure [[H2896]] gold [[H3800]] has become dull! [[H8132]] The gems [[H68]] of the temple [[H6944]] lie scattered [[H8210]] on every [[H3605]] street [[H2351]] corner. [[H7218]]

###### 2
How [[H349]] the precious [[H3368]] sons [[H1121]] of Zion, [[H6726]] once worth their weight [[H5537]] in pure gold, [[H6337]] are now esteemed [[H2803]] as clay [[H2789]] jars, [[H5035]] the work [[H4639]] of a potter’s [[H3335]] hands! [[H3027]]

###### 3
Even [[H1571]] jackals [[H8568]] offer [[H2502]] their breasts [[H7699]] to nurse [[H3243]] their young, [[H1482]] [but] the daughter [[H1323]] of my people [[H5971]] has become cruel, [[H393]] like an ostrich [[H3283]] in the wilderness. [[H4057]]

###### 4
The nursing infant’s [[H3243]] tongue [[H3956]] clings [[H1692]] in thirst [[H6772]] to [[H413]] the roof of his mouth. [[H2441]] Little children [[H5768]] beg for [[H7592]] bread, [[H3899]] but no [[H369]] one gives them any. [[H6566]]

###### 5
Those who once ate [[H398]] delicacies [[H4574]] are destitute [[H8074]] in the streets; [[H2351]] those brought up [[H539]] in [[H5921]] purple [[H8438]] huddle [[H2263]] in ash heaps. [[H830]]

###### 6
The punishment [[H5771]] of the daughter [[H1323]] of my people [[H5971]] is greater [[H1431]] than [that] [[H2403]] of Sodom, [[H5467]] which was overthrown [[H2015]] in [[H3644]] an instant [[H7281]] without [[H3808]] a hand [[H3027]] turned toward her. [[H2342]]

###### 7
Her dignitaries [[H5139]] were brighter [[H2141]] than snow, [[H7950]] whiter [[H6705]] than milk; [[H2461]] their bodies [[H6106]] were more ruddy [[H119]] than rubies, [[H6443]] their appearance [[H1508]] like sapphires. [[H5601]]

###### 8
But now their appearance [[H8389]] is blacker [[H2821]] than soot; [[H7815]] they are not [[H3808]] recognized [[H5234]] in the streets. [[H2351]] Their skin [[H5785]] has shriveled [[H6821]] on [[H5921]] their bones; [[H6106]] it has become [[H1961]] as dry [[H3001]] as a stick. [[H6086]]

###### 9
Those slain [[H2491]] by the sword [[H2719]] are [[H1961]] better off [[H2896]] than those who die [[H2491]] of hunger, [[H7458]] who [[H1992]] waste away, [[H2100]] pierced with pain [[H1856]] because the fields [[H7704]] lack produce. [[H8570]]

###### 10
The hands [[H3027]] of compassionate [[H7362]] women [[H802]] have cooked [[H1310]] their own children, [[H3206]] who became [[H1961]] their food [[H1262]] in the destruction [[H7667]] of the daughter [[H1323]] of my people. [[H5971]]

###### 11
The LORD [[H3068]] has exhausted [[H3615]] His wrath; [[H2534]] He has poured out [[H8210]] His fierce [[H2740]] anger; [[H639]] He has kindled [[H3341]] a fire [[H784]] in Zion, [[H6726]] and it has consumed [[H398]] her foundations. [[H3247]]

###### 12
The kings [[H4428]] of the earth [[H776]] did not [[H3808]] believe, [[H539]] nor any [[H3605]] people [[H3427]] of the world, [[H8398]] that [[H3588]] an enemy [[H6862]] or a foe [[H341]] could enter [[H935]] the gates [[H8179]] of Jerusalem. [[H3389]]

###### 13
[But this was] for the sins [[H2403]] of her prophets [[H5030]] and the guilt [[H5771]] of her priests, [[H3548]] who shed [[H8210]] the blood [[H1818]] of the righteous [[H6662]] in her midst. [[H7130]]

###### 14
They wandered [[H5128]] blind [[H5787]] in the streets, [[H2351]] defiled [[H1351]] by this blood, [[H1818]] so that no [[H3808]] one dared [[H3201]] to touch [[H5060]] their garments. [[H3830]]

###### 15
“Go away! [[H5493]] Unclean!” [[H2931]] men shouted at them. [[H7121]] “Away, [[H5493]] away! [[H5493]] Do not [[H408]] touch us!” [[H5060]] So [[H3588]] they fled [[H5132]] and [[H1571]] wandered. [[H5128]] Among the nations [[H1471]] it was said, [[H559]] “They can stay [[H1481]] here no [[H3808]] longer.” [[H3254]]

###### 16
The LORD Himself [[H6440]] has scattered them; [[H2505]] He regards [[H5027]] them no [[H3808]] more. [[H3254]] The priests [[H3548]] are shown no honor, [[H5375]] the elders [[H2205]] find no [[H3808]] favor. [[H2603]]

###### 17
All the while [[H5751]] our eyes [[H5869]] were failing [[H3615]] as we looked in vain [[H1892]] for [[H413]] help. [[H5833]] We watched [[H6822]] from our towers [[H6822]] for [[H413]] a nation [[H1471]] [that] could not [[H3808]] save us. [[H3467]]

###### 18
They stalked [[H6679]] our every step, [[H6806]] so that we could not walk [[H1980]] in our streets. [[H7339]] Our end [[H7093]] drew near, [[H7126]] our time [[H3117]] ran out, [[H4390]] for our end [[H7093]] had come! [[H935]]

###### 19
Those who chased us [[H7291]] were [[H1961]] swifter [[H7031]] than the eagles [[H5404]] in the sky; [[H8064]] they pursued us [[H1814]] over [[H5921]] the mountains [[H2022]] and ambushed us [[H693]] in the wilderness. [[H4057]]

###### 20
The LORD’s [[H3068]] anointed, [[H4899]] the breath [[H7307]] of our life, [[H639]] was captured [[H3920]] in their pits. [[H7825]] We had said [[H559]] of him, [[H834]] “Under his shadow [[H6738]] we will live [[H2421]] among the nations.” [[H1471]]

###### 21
So rejoice [[H7797]] and be glad, [[H8056]] O daughter [[H1323]] of Edom, [[H123]] who dwells [[H3427]] in the land [[H776]] of Uz. [[H5780]] Yet the cup [[H3563]] will pass [[H5674]] to [[H5921]] you as well; [[H1571]] you will get drunk [[H7937]] and expose yourself. [[H6168]]

###### 22
O Daughter [[H1323]] of Zion, [[H6726]] your punishment [[H5771]] is complete; [[H8552]] He will not [[H3808]] prolong [[H3254]] your exile. [[H1540]] But He will punish [[H6485]] your iniquity, [[H5771]] O Daughter [[H1323]] of Edom; [[H123]] He will expose [[H1540]] your sins. [[H2403]]
