###### 1
“Come, [[H1945]] all of you [[H3605]] who thirst, [[H6771]] come [[H1980]] to the waters; [[H4325]] and you [[H834]] without [[H369]] money, [[H3701]] come, [[H1980]] buy, [[H7666]] and eat! [[H398]] Come, [[H1980]] buy [[H7666]] wine [[H3196]] and milk, [[H2461]] without [[H3808]] money [[H3701]] and without [[H3808]] cost! [[H4242]]

###### 2
Why [[H4100]] spend [[H8254]] money [[H3701]] on that which is not [[H3808]] bread, [[H3899]] and your labor [[H3018]] on that which does not [[H3808]] satisfy? [[H7654]] Listen [[H8085]] carefully [[H8085]] to Me, [[H413]] and eat [[H398]] what is good, [[H2896]] and your soul [[H5315]] will delight [[H6026]] in the richest of foods. [[H1880]]

###### 3
Incline [[H5186]] your ear [[H241]] and come [[H1980]] to Me; [[H413]] listen, [[H8085]] so that your soul [[H5315]] may live. [[H2421]] I will make [[H3772]] an everlasting [[H5769]] covenant with you, [[H1285]] my loving devotion [[H2617]] assured [[H539]] to David. [[H1732]]

###### 4
Behold, [[H2005]] I have made him [[H5414]] a witness [[H5707]] to the nations, [[H3816]] a leader [[H5057]] and commander [[H6680]] of the peoples. [[H3816]]

###### 5
Surely [[H2005]] you will summon [[H7121]] a nation [[H1471]] you do not [[H3808]] know, [[H3045]] and nations [[H1471]] who do not [[H3808]] know you [[H3045]] will run [[H7323]] to you. [[H413]] For [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God, [[H430]] the Holy [[H6918]] One of Israel, [[H3478]] has bestowed glory on you.” [[H6286]]

###### 6
Seek [[H1875]] the LORD [[H3068]] while He may be found; [[H4672]] call on Him [[H7121]] while He is [[H1961]] near. [[H7138]]

###### 7
Let the wicked man [[H7563]] forsake [[H5800]] his own way [[H1870]] and the unrighteous [[H205]] man [[H376]] his own thoughts; [[H4284]] let him return [[H7725]] to [[H413]] the LORD, [[H3069]] that He may have compassion, [[H7355]] and to [[H413]] our God, [[H430]] for [[H3588]] He will freely [[H7235]] pardon. [[H5545]]

###### 8
“For [[H3588]] My thoughts [[H4284]] are not [[H3808]] your thoughts, [[H4284]] neither are [[H3808]] your ways [[H1870]] My ways,” [[H1870]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD. [[H3068]]

###### 9
“For [[H3588]] [as] the heavens [[H8064]] are higher [[H1361]] than the earth, [[H776]] so [[H3651]] My ways [[H1870]] are higher [[H1361]] than your ways [[H1870]] and My thoughts [[H4284]] than your thoughts. [[H4284]]

###### 10
For [[H3588]] just as [[H834]] rain [[H1653]] and snow [[H7950]] fall [[H3381]] from [[H4480]] heaven [[H8064]] and do not [[H3808]] return [[H7725]] without [[H3588]] watering [[H7301]] the earth, [[H776]] making it bud [[H3205]] and sprout, [[H6779]] and providing [[H5414]] seed [[H2233]] to sow [[H2232]] and food [[H3899]] to eat, [[H398]]

###### 11
so [[H3651]] My word [[H1697]] that [[H834]] proceeds [[H3318]] from My mouth [[H6310]] will not [[H3808]] return [[H7725]] to Me [[H413]] empty, [[H7387]] but [[H3588]] it will accomplish [[H6213]] what [[H834]] I please, [[H2654]] and it will prosper [[H6743]] where [[H834]] I send it. [[H7971]]

###### 12
You will indeed [[H3588]] go out [[H3318]] with joy [[H8057]] and be led forth [[H2986]] in peace; [[H7965]] the mountains [[H2022]] and hills [[H1389]] will burst [[H6476]] into song [[H7440]] before you, [[H6440]] and all [[H3605]] the trees [[H6086]] of the field [[H7704]] will clap [[H4222]] their hands. [[H3709]]

###### 13
Instead of [[H8478]] the thornbush, [[H5285]] a cypress [[H1265]] will grow, [[H5927]] and instead of [[H8478]] the brier, [[H5636]] a myrtle [[H1918]] will spring up; [[H5927]] they will make [[H1961]] a name [[H8034]] for the LORD [[H3068]] as an everlasting [[H5769]] sign, [[H226]] never [[H3808]] to be destroyed.” [[H3772]]
