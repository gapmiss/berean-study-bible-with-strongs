[[Isaiah 44|←]] • [[Isaiah 46|→]]

### 1
This is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] says [[H559]] to Cyrus [[H3566]] His anointed, [[H4899]] whose right hand [[H3225]] I have grasped [[H2388]] to subdue [[H7286]] nations [[H1471]] before him, [[H6440]] to disarm [[H6605]] kings, [[H4428]] to open [[H6605]] the doors [[H1817]] before him, [[H6440]] so that the gates [[H8179]] will not [[H3808]] be shut: [[H5462]]

### 2
“I [[H589]] will go [[H1980]] before you [[H6440]] and level [[H3474]] the mountains; [[H1921]] I will break down [[H7665]] the gates [[H1817]] of bronze [[H5154]] and cut through [[H1438]] the bars [[H1280]] of iron. [[H1270]]

### 3
I will give [[H5414]] you the treasures [[H214]] of darkness [[H2822]] and the hidden riches [[H4301]] of secret places, [[H4565]] so that [[H4616]] you may know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I [am] [[H589]] the LORD, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] who calls [[H7121]] you by name. [[H8034]]

### 4
For the sake [[H4616]] of Jacob [[H3290]] My servant [[H5650]] and Israel [[H3478]] My chosen one, [[H972]] I call [[H7121]] you by name; [[H8034]] I have given you a title of honor, [[H3655]] though you have not [[H3808]] known Me. [[H3045]]

### 5
I [[H589]] am the LORD, [[H3068]] and there is no [[H369]] other; [[H5750]] there is no [[H369]] God [[H430]] but Me. [[H2108]] I will equip you for battle, [[H247]] though you have not [[H3808]] known Me, [[H3045]]

### 6
so that [[H4616]] all may know, [[H3045]] from the rising [[H4217]] of the sun [[H8121]] to the place of its setting, [[H4628]] that [[H3588]] there is none [[H657]] but Me. [[H1107]] I [[H589]] am the LORD, [[H3068]] and there is no [[H369]] other. [[H5750]]

### 7
I form [[H3335]] light [[H216]] and create [[H1254]] darkness; [[H2822]] I bring [[H6213]] prosperity [[H7965]] and create [[H1254]] calamity. [[H7451]] I, [[H589]] the LORD, [[H3068]] do [[H6213]] all [[H3605]] these things. [[H428]]

### 8
Drip down, [[H7491]] O heavens, [[H8064]] from above, [[H4605]] and let the skies [[H7834]] pour down [[H5140]] righteousness. [[H6664]] Let the earth [[H776]] open up [[H6605]] that salvation [[H3468]] may sprout [[H6509]] and righteousness [[H6666]] spring up [[H6779]] with it; [[H3162]] I, [[H589]] the LORD, [[H3068]] have created it. [[H1254]]

### 9
Woe [[H1945]] to him who quarrels [[H7378]] with his Maker— [[H3335]] one clay pot [[H2789]] among many. [[H2789]] Does the clay [[H2563]] ask [[H559]] the potter, [[H3335]] ‘What [[H4100]] are you making?’ [[H6213]] Does your work say, [[H6467]] ‘He has no [[H369]] hands’? [[H3027]]

### 10
Woe [[H1945]] to him who says [[H559]] to his father, [[H1]] ‘What [[H4100]] have you begotten?’ [[H3205]] or to his mother, [[H802]] ‘What [[H4100]] have you brought forth?’ [[H2342]]

### 11
Thus [[H3541]] says [[H559]] the LORD, [[H3068]] the Holy [[H6918]] One of Israel, [[H3478]] and its Maker: [[H3335]] “How dare you [[H857]] question Me [[H7592]] concerning [[H5921]] My sons, [[H1121]] or instruct [[H6680]] Me about [[H5921]] the work [[H6467]] of My hands? [[H3027]]

### 12
It is I [[H595]] who made [[H6213]] the earth, [[H776]] and created [[H1254]] man [[H120]] upon it. [[H5921]] It was My hands [[H3027]] that stretched out [[H5186]] the heavens, [[H8064]] and I ordained [[H6680]] all [[H3605]] their host. [[H6635]]

### 13
I [[H595]] will raise up [Cyrus] [[H5782]] in righteousness, [[H6664]] and I will make [[H3474]] all [[H3605]] his ways [straight]. [[H1870]] He [[H1931]] will rebuild [[H1129]] My city [[H5892]] and set My exiles [[H1546]] free, [[H7971]] but not [[H3808]] for payment [[H4242]] [or] [[H3808]] reward,” [[H7810]] says [[H559]] the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts. [[H6635]]

### 14
This is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3069]] says: [[H559]] “The products [[H3018]] of Egypt [[H4714]] and the merchandise [[H5505]] of Cush, [[H3568]] along with the Sabeans, [[H5436]] men [[H376]] of stature, [[H4060]] will come over [[H5674]] to you [[H5921]] and will be yours; [[H1961]] they will trudge behind [[H310]] you; [[H1980]] they will come over [[H5674]] in chains [[H2131]] and bow down [[H7812]] to you. [[H413]] They will confess [[H6419]] to you: [[H413]] God [[H410]] is indeed with you, [[H389]] and there is no [[H369]] other; [[H5750]] there is no [[H657]] other God. [[H430]]

### 15
Truly [[H403]] You [[H859]] are a God [[H410]] who hides Himself, [[H5641]] O God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] the Savior. [[H3467]]

### 16
They will all [[H3605]] be put to shame [[H954]] and [[H1571]] humiliated; [[H3637]] the makers [[H2796]] of idols [[H6736]] will go away [[H1980]] together [[H3162]] in disgrace. [[H3639]]

### 17
[But] Israel [[H3478]] will be saved [[H3467]] by the LORD [[H3068]] with an everlasting [[H5769]] salvation; [[H8668]] you will not [[H3808]] be put to shame [[H954]] or humiliated, [[H3637]] to [[H5704]] ages [[H5769]] everlasting. [[H5703]]

### 18
For [[H3588]] thus [[H3541]] says [[H559]] the LORD— [[H3068]] He who created [[H1254]] the heavens; [[H8064]] He [[H1931]] [is] God; [[H430]] He formed [[H3335]] the earth [[H776]] and fashioned it; [[H6213]] He [[H1931]] established it; [[H3559]] He did not [[H3808]] create [[H1254]] it to be empty, [[H8414]] but formed [[H3335]] it to be inhabited— [[H3427]] “I [[H589]] am the LORD, [[H3068]] and there is no [[H369]] other. [[H5750]]

### 19
I have not [[H3808]] spoken [[H1696]] in secret, [[H5643]] from a place [[H4725]] in a land [[H776]] of darkness. [[H2822]] I did not [[H3808]] say [[H559]] to the descendants [[H2233]] of Jacob: [[H3290]] ‘Seek [[H1245]] Me in a wasteland.’ [[H8414]] I, [[H589]] the LORD, [[H3068]] speak [[H1696]] the truth; [[H6664]] I say [[H5046]] what is right. [[H4339]]

### 20
Come, [[H935]] gather together, [[H6908]] and draw near, [[H5066]] you fugitives [[H6412]] of the nations. [[H1471]] Ignorant [are] [[H3045]] those who carry [[H5375]] idols [[H6459]] of wood [[H6086]] and pray [[H6419]] to [[H413]] a god [[H410]] that cannot [[H3808]] save. [[H3467]]

### 21
Speak up [[H5046]] and present your case— [[H5066]] yes, [[H637]] let them take counsel [[H3289]] together. [[H3162]] Who [[H4310]] foretold [[H8085]] this [[H2063]] long ago? [[H6924]] Who announced it [[H5046]] from ancient times? [[H227]] Was it not [[H3808]] I, [[H589]] the LORD? [[H3068]] There is no [[H369]] other [[H5750]] God [[H430]] but Me, [[H1107]] a righteous [[H6662]] God [[H410]] and Savior; [[H3467]] there is none [[H369]] but Me. [[H2108]]

### 22
Turn [[H6437]] to Me [[H413]] and be saved, [[H3467]] all [[H3605]] the ends [[H657]] of the earth; [[H776]] for [[H3588]] I [am] [[H589]] God, [[H410]] and there is no [[H369]] other. [[H5750]]

### 23
By Myself I have sworn; [[H7650]] truth [[H6666]] has gone out [[H3318]] from My mouth, [[H6310]] a word [[H1697]] that will not [[H3808]] be revoked: [[H7725]] Every [[H3605]] knee [[H1290]] will bow [[H3766]] before Me,  every [[H3605]] tongue [[H3956]] will confess allegiance. [[H7650]]

### 24
Surely [[H389]] they will say of Me, [[H559]] ‘In the LORD [[H3068]] alone  [are] righteousness [[H6666]] and strength.’” [[H5797]] All [[H3605]] who rage against Him [[H2734]] will come [[H935]] to Him [[H5704]] and be put to shame. [[H954]]

### 25
In the LORD [[H3068]] all [[H3605]] descendants [[H2233]] of Israel [[H3478]] will find justification [[H6663]] and glory. [[H1984]]
