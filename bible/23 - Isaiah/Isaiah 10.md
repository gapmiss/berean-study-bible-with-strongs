# Isaiah 10

[[Isaiah 9|←]] • [[Isaiah 11|→]]

---

### 1
Woe [[H1945]] to those who enact [[H2710]] unjust [[H205]] statutes [[H2711]] and issue [[H3789]] oppressive [[H5999]] decrees, [[H3789]]

### 2
to deprive [[H5186]] the poor [[H1800]] of fair treatment [[H1779]] and withhold [[H1497]] justice [[H4941]] from the oppressed [[H6041]] of My people, [[H5971]] to make [[H1961]] widows [[H490]] their spoil [[H7998]] and plunder [[H962]] the fatherless. [[H3490]]

### 3
What [[H4100]] will you do [[H6213]] on the day [[H3117]] of reckoning [[H6486]] when devastation [[H7722]] comes [[H935]] from afar? [[H4801]] To [[H5921]] whom [[H4310]] will you flee [[H5127]] for help? [[H5833]] Where [[H575]] will you leave [[H5800]] your wealth? [[H3519]]

### 4
Nothing will remain [[H1115]] but to crouch [[H3766]] among [[H8478]] the captives [[H616]] or fall [[H5307]] among [[H8478]] the slain. [[H2026]] Despite all [[H3605]] this, [[H2063]] His anger [[H639]] is not [[H3808]] turned away; [[H7725]] His hand [[H3027]] is still [[H5750]] upraised. [[H5186]]

### 5
Woe [[H1945]] to Assyria, [[H804]] the rod [[H7626]] of My anger; [[H639]] the staff [[H4294]] in their hands [[H3027]] is My wrath. [[H2195]]

### 6
I will send him [[H7971]] against a godless [[H2611]] nation; [[H1471]] I will dispatch him [[H6680]] against [[H5921]] a people [[H5971]] destined for My rage, [[H5678]] to take [[H7997]] spoils [[H7998]] and seize [[H962]] plunder, [[H957]] and to trample them down [[H7760]] like clay [[H2563]] in the streets. [[H2351]]

### 7
But this [[H1931]] is not [[H3808]] what [[H3651]] he intends; [[H1819]] this is not [[H3808]] what [[H3651]] he plans. [[H2803]] His purpose [[H3824]] is to destroy [[H8045]] and cut off [[H3772]] many [[H3808]] nations. [[H1471]]

### 8
“Are not [[H3808]] all [[H3162]] my commanders [[H8269]] kings?” [[H4428]] he says. [[H559]]

### 9
“Is not [[H3808]] Calno [[H3641]] like Carchemish? [[H3751]] Is not [[H3808]] Hamath [[H2574]] like Arpad? [[H774]] Is not [[H3808]] Samaria [[H8111]] like Damascus? [[H1834]]

### 10
As [[H834]] my hand [[H3027]] seized [[H4672]] the idolatrous [[H457]] kingdoms, [[H4467]] whose images [surpassed] [[H6456]] those of Jerusalem [[H3389]] and Samaria, [[H8111]]

### 11
and as [[H834]] I have done to [[H6213]] Samaria [[H8111]] and its idols, [[H457]] will I not [[H3808]] also [[H3651]] do [[H6213]] to Jerusalem [[H3389]] and her idols?” [[H6091]]

### 12
So when [[H3588]] the Lord [[H136]] has completed [[H1214]] all [[H3605]] His work [[H4639]] against Mount [[H2022]] Zion [[H6726]] and Jerusalem, [[H3389]] He will say, “I will punish [[H6485]] the king [[H4428]] of Assyria [[H804]] for [[H5921]] the fruit [[H6529]] of his arrogant [[H1433]] heart [[H3824]] and the proud [[H7312]] look in his eyes.” [[H5869]]

### 13
For [[H3588]] he says: [[H559]] “By the strength [[H3581]] of my hand [[H3027]] I have done [this], [[H6213]] and [by my] wisdom, [[H2451]] for [[H3588]] I am clever. [[H995]] I have removed [[H5493]] the boundaries [[H1367]] of nations [[H5971]] and plundered [[H8154]] their treasures; [[H6264]] like a mighty one [[H47]] I subdued [[H3381]] their rulers. [[H3427]]

### 14
My hand [[H3027]] reached [[H4672]] as into a nest [[H7064]] to seize the wealth [[H2428]] of the nations. [[H5971]] Like one gathering [[H622]] abandoned [[H5800]] eggs, [[H1000]] I [[H589]] gathered [[H622]] all [[H3605]] the earth. [[H776]] No [[H3808]] wing [[H3671]] fluttered, [[H5074]] no beak [[H6310]] opened [[H6475]] or chirped.” [[H6850]]

### 15
Does an ax [[H1631]] raise itself [[H6286]] above [[H5921]] the one who swings it? [[H2672]] Does a saw [[H4883]] boast [[H1431]] over him [[H5921]] who saws with it? [[H5130]] It would be like a staff [[H7626]] waving [[H5130]] the one who lifts it! [[H7311]] It would be like a staff [[H4294]] lifting [[H7311]] him who is not [[H3808]] wood! [[H6086]]

### 16
Therefore [[H3651]] the Lord [[H113]] GOD [[H3068]] of Hosts [[H6635]] will send [[H7971]] a wasting disease [[H7332]] among [Assyria’s] stout warriors, [[H4924]] and under [[H8478]] his pomp [[H3519]] will be kindled [[H3344]] a fire [[H3350]] like a burning [[H3350]] flame. [[H784]]

### 17
And the Light [[H216]] of Israel [[H3478]] will become [[H1961]] a fire, [[H784]] and its Holy One [[H6918]] a flame. [[H3852]] In a single [[H259]] day [[H3117]] it will burn [[H1197]] and devour [[H398]] Assyria’s thorns [[H7898]] and thistles. [[H8068]]

### 18
The splendor [[H3519]] of its forests [[H3293]] and orchards, [[H3759]] both soul [[H5315]] and body, [[H1320]] it will completely destroy, [[H3615]] as a sickness consumes a man. [[H4549]]

### 19
The remaining [[H7605]] trees [[H6086]] of its forests [[H3293]] will be [[H1961]] so few [[H4557]] that a child [[H5288]] could count them. [[H3789]]

### 20
On that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] the remnant [[H7605]] of Israel [[H3478]] and the survivors [[H6413]] of the house [[H1004]] of Jacob [[H3290]] will no [[H3808]] longer [[H3254]] depend [[H8172]] on [[H5921]] him who struck them, [[H5221]] but they will truly [[H571]] rely [[H8172]] on [[H5921]] the LORD, [[H3068]] the Holy [[H6918]] One of Israel. [[H3478]]

### 21
A remnant [[H7605]] will return, [[H7725]] a remnant [[H7605]] of Jacob, [[H3290]] to [[H413]] the Mighty [[H1368]] God. [[H410]]

### 22
Though [[H3588]] your people, [[H5971]] O Israel, [[H3478]] be [[H1961]] like the sand [[H2344]] of the sea, [[H3220]] only a remnant [[H7605]] will return. [[H7725]] Destruction [[H3631]] has been decreed, [[H2782]] overflowing [[H7857]] with righteousness. [[H6666]]

### 23
For [[H3588]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD [[H3069]] of Hosts [[H6635]] will carry out [[H6213]] the destruction [[H3617]] decreed [[H2782]] upon [[H7130]] the whole [[H3605]] land. [[H776]]

### 24
Therefore, [[H3651]] this is what [[H3541]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD [[H3068]] of Hosts [[H6635]] says: [[H559]] “O My people [[H5971]] who dwell [[H3427]] in Zion, [[H6726]] do not [[H408]] fear [[H3372]] Assyria, [[H804]] who strikes [[H5221]] you with a rod [[H7626]] and lifts [[H5375]] his staff [[H4294]] against you [[H5921]] as the Egyptians [[H4714]] did. [[H1870]]

### 25
For [[H3588]] in just [[H5750]] a very little while [[H4592]] My wrath [[H2195]] will be spent [[H3615]] and My anger [[H639]] will turn to [[H5921]] their destruction.” [[H8399]]

### 26
And the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts [[H6635]] will brandish [[H5782]] a whip [[H7752]] against them, [[H5921]] as when He struck [[H4347]] Midian [[H4080]] at the rock [[H6697]] of Oreb; [[H6159]] He will raise [[H5375]] His staff [[H4294]] over [[H5921]] the sea, [[H3220]] as He did in Egypt. [[H4714]]

### 27
On that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] the burden [[H5448]] will be lifted [[H5493]] from [[H5921]] your shoulders, [[H7926]] and the yoke [[H5923]] from [[H5921]] your neck. [[H6677]] The yoke [[H5923]] will be broken [[H2254]] because of [[H6440]] your fatness. [[H8081]]

### 28
[Assyria] has entered [[H935]] Aiath [[H5857]] and passed through [[H5674]] Migron, [[H4051]] storing [[H6485]] supplies [[H3627]] at Michmash. [[H4363]]

### 29
They have crossed [[H5674]] at the ford: [[H4569]] “We will spend the night [[H4411]] at Geba.” [[H1387]] Ramah [[H7414]] trembles; [[H2729]] Gibeah [[H1390]] of Saul [[H7586]] flees. [[H5127]]

### 30
Cry aloud, [[H6670]] O daughter [[H1323]] of Gallim! [[H1554]] Listen, [[H7181]] O Laishah! [[H3919]] O wretched [[H6041]] Anathoth! [[H6068]]

### 31
Madmenah [[H4088]] flees; [[H5074]] the people [[H3427]] of Gebim [[H1374]] take refuge. [[H5756]]

### 32
Yet [[H5750]] today [[H3117]] they will halt [[H5975]] at Nob, [[H5011]] shaking [[H5130]] a fist [[H3027]] at the mount [[H2022]] of the Daughter [[H1323]] of Zion, [[H1004]] at the hill [[H1389]] of Jerusalem. [[H3389]]

### 33
Behold, [[H2009]] the Lord [[H113]] GOD [[H3068]] of Hosts [[H6635]] will lop off [[H5586]] the branches [[H6288]] with terrifying power. [[H4637]] The tall [[H7311]] trees [[H6967]] will be cut down, [[H1438]] the lofty ones [[H1364]] will be felled. [[H8213]]

### 34
He will clear [[H5362]] the forest [[H3293]] thickets [[H5442]] with an ax, [[H1270]] and Lebanon [[H3844]] will fall [[H5307]] before the Mighty One. [[H117]]
