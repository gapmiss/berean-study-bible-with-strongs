# Isaiah 16

[[Isaiah 15|←]] • [[Isaiah 17|→]]

---

### 1
Send [[H7971]] the [tribute] lambs [[H3733]] to the ruler [[H4910]] of the land, [[H776]] from Sela [[H5554]] in the desert [[H4057]] to [[H413]] the mount [[H2022]] of the Daughter [[H1323]] of Zion. [[H6726]]

### 2
Like fluttering birds [[H5775]] pushed [[H7971]] out of the nest, [[H7064]] so are [[H1961]] the daughters [[H1323]] of Moab [[H4124]] at the fords [[H4569]] of the Arnon: [[H769]]

### 3
“Give [[H935]] us counsel, [[H6098]] render [[H6213]] a decision. [[H6415]] Shelter us at noonday [[H6672]] with shade [[H6738]] as dark as night. [[H3915]] Hide [[H5641]] the refugees; [[H5080]] do not [[H408]] betray [[H1540]] the one who flees. [[H5074]]

### 4
Let my fugitives [[H5080]] stay with you; [[H1481]] be [[H1933]] a refuge [[H5643]] for Moab [[H4124]] from [[H4480]] the destroyer.” [[H7703]] When [[H3588]] the oppressor [[H4160]] has gone, [[H656]] destruction [[H7701]] has ceased, [[H3615]] and the oppressors [[H7429]] have vanished [[H8552]] from the land, [[H776]]

### 5
in loving devotion [[H2617]] a throne [[H3678]] will be established [[H3559]] in the tent [[H168]] of David. [[H1732]] A judge [[H8199]] seeking [[H1875]] justice [[H4941]] and prompt [[H4106]] in righteousness [[H6664]] will sit [[H3427]] on [it] [[H5921]] in faithfulness. [[H571]]

### 6
We have heard [[H8085]] of Moab’s [[H4124]] pride, [[H1347]] his exceeding [[H3966]] pride [[H1341]] [and] conceit, [[H1346]] his overflowing [[H5678]] arrogance. [[H1347]] But his boasting [[H907]] is empty. [[H3808]]

### 7
Therefore [[H3651]] let Moab [[H4124]] wail; [[H3213]] let them wail [[H3213]] together [[H3605]] for Moab. [[H4124]] Mourn [[H1897]] for the raisin cakes [[H808]] of Kir-hareseth, [[H7025]] you who are utterly [[H389]] stricken. [[H5218]]

### 8
For [[H3588]] the fields [[H7709]] of Heshbon [[H2809]] have withered, [[H535]] along with the grapevines [[H1612]] of Sibmah. [[H7643]] The rulers [[H1167]] of the nations [[H1471]] have trampled [[H1986]] its choicest vines [[H8291]] that reached [[H5060]] as [[H5704]] far as Jazer [[H3270]] and spread [[H8582]] toward the desert. [[H4057]] Their shoots [[H7976]] spread out [[H5203]] and reached [[H5674]] the sea. [[H3220]]

### 9
So [[H5921]] I weep [[H1058]] with Jazer [[H3270]] for the vines [[H1612]] of Sibmah; [[H7643]] I drench [[H7301]] Heshbon [[H2809]] and Elealeh [[H500]] with my tears. [[H1832]] Triumphant shouts [[H1959]] have fallen silent [[H5307]] over [[H5921]] your summer fruit [[H7019]] and your harvest. [[H7105]]

### 10
Joy [[H8057]] and gladness [[H1524]] are removed [[H622]] from [[H4480]] the orchard; [[H3759]] no one [[H3808]] sings [[H7442]] or shouts [[H7321]] in the vineyards. [[H3754]] No [[H3808]] one tramples [[H1869]] the grapes [[H3196]] in the winepresses; [[H3342]] I have put an end [[H7673]] to the cheering. [[H1959]]

### 11
Therefore [[H5921]] my heart [[H4578]] laments [[H1993]] for Moab [[H4124]] like a harp, [[H3658]] my inmost being [[H7130]] for Kir-hareseth. [[H7025]]

### 12
When [[H3588]] Moab [[H4124]] appears [[H7200]] on [[H5921]] the high place, [[H1116]] when [[H3588]] he wearies himself [[H3811]] and enters [[H935]] his sanctuary [[H4720]] to pray, [[H6419]] it will do him no [[H3808]] good. [[H3201]]

### 13
This [[H2088]] is the message [[H1697]] that [[H834]] the LORD [[H3069]] spoke [[H1696]] earlier [[H227]] concerning [[H413]] Moab. [[H4124]]

### 14
And now [[H6258]] the LORD [[H3068]] says, [[H1696]] “In three [[H7969]] years, [[H8141]] as a hired worker [[H7916]] counts the years, [[H8141]] Moab’s [[H4124]] splendor [[H3519]] will become an object of contempt, [[H7034]] with all [[H3605]] her many [[H7227]] people. [[H1995]] And those who are left [[H7605]] will be few [[H4592]] [and] feeble.” [[H3808]]
