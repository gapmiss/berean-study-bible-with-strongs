# Isaiah 51

[[Isaiah 50|←]] • [[Isaiah 52|→]]

---

###### 1
Listen [[H8085]] to Me, [[H413]] you who pursue [[H7291]] righteousness, [[H6664]] you who seek [[H1245]] the LORD: [[H3068]] Look [[H5027]] to [[H413]] the rock [[H6697]] from which you were cut, [[H2672]] and to [[H413]] the quarry [[H4718]] from which you were hewn. [[H5365]]

###### 2
Look [[H5027]] to [[H413]] Abraham [[H85]] your father, [[H1]] and to [[H413]] Sarah [[H8283]] who bore you. [[H2342]] When [[H3588]] I called him, [[H7121]] he was but one; [[H259]] then I blessed him [[H1288]] and multiplied him. [[H7235]]

###### 3
For [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] will comfort [[H5162]] Zion [[H6726]] and look with compassion [[H5162]] on all her [[H3605]] ruins; [[H2723]] He will make [[H7760]] her wilderness [[H4057]] like Eden [[H5731]] and her desert [[H6160]] like the garden [[H1588]] of the LORD. [[H3068]] Joy [[H8342]] and gladness [[H8057]] will be found in her, [[H4672]] thanksgiving [[H8426]] and melodious [[H2172]] song. [[H6963]]

###### 4
Pay attention [[H7181]] to Me, [[H413]] My people, [[H5971]] and listen [[H238]] to Me, [[H413]] My nation; [[H3816]] for [[H3588]] a law [[H8451]] will go out from Me, [[H3318]] and My justice [will become] [[H4941]] a light [[H216]] to the nations; [[H5971]] I will bring it about quickly. [[H7280]]

###### 5
My righteousness [[H6664]] draws near, [[H7138]] My salvation [[H3468]] is on the way, [[H3318]] and My arms [[H2220]] will bring justice [[H8199]] to the nations. [[H5971]] The islands [[H339]] will look [[H6960]] for Me [[H413]] and wait in hope [[H3176]] for [[H413]] My arm. [[H2220]]

###### 6
Lift up [[H5375]] your eyes [[H5869]] to the heavens, [[H8064]] and look [[H5027]] at [[H413]] the earth [[H776]] below; [[H8478]] for [[H3588]] the heavens [[H8064]] will vanish [[H4414]] like smoke, [[H6227]] the earth [[H776]] will wear out [[H1086]] like a garment, [[H899]] and its people [[H3427]] will die [[H4191]] like [gnats]. [[H3644]] But My salvation [[H3444]] will last forever, [[H1961]] and My righteousness [[H6666]] will never [[H3808]] fail. [[H2865]]

###### 7
Listen [[H8085]] to Me, [[H413]] you who know [[H3045]] what is right, [[H6664]] you people [[H5971]] with My law [[H8451]] in your hearts: [[H3820]] Do not [[H408]] fear [[H3372]] the scorn [[H2781]] of men; [[H582]] do not [[H408]] be broken [[H2865]] by their insults. [[H1421]]

###### 8
For [[H3588]] the moth [[H6211]] will devour them [[H398]] like a garment, [[H899]] and the worm [[H5580]] will eat [[H398]] them like wool. [[H6785]] But My righteousness [[H6666]] will last forever, [[H1961]] My salvation [[H3444]] through all generations. [[H1755]]

###### 9
Awaken, [[H5782]] awaken, [[H5782]] put on [[H3847]] strength, [[H5797]] O arm [[H2220]] of the LORD. [[H3069]] Wake up [[H5782]] as in days [[H3117]] past, [[H6924]] as in generations [[H1755]] of long ago. [[H5769]] Was it not [[H3808]] You [[H859]] who cut Rahab [[H7294]] to pieces, [[H2672]] who pierced through [[H2490]] the dragon? [[H8577]]

###### 10
Was it not [[H3808]] You [[H859]] who dried up [[H2717]] the sea, [[H3220]] the waters [[H4325]] of the great [[H7227]] deep, [[H8415]] who made [[H7760]] a road [[H1870]] in the depths [[H4615]] of the sea [[H3220]] for the redeemed [[H1350]] to cross over? [[H5674]]

###### 11
So the redeemed [[H6299]] of the LORD [[H3068]] will return [[H7725]] and enter [[H935]] Zion [[H6726]] with singing, [[H7440]] crowned [[H5921]] with unending [[H5769]] joy. [[H8057]] Joy [[H8057]] and gladness [[H8342]] will overtake them, [[H5381]] and sorrow [[H3015]] and sighing [[H585]] will flee. [[H5127]]

###### 12
I, [[H595]] even I, [[H595]] am He [[H1931]] who comforts you. [[H5162]] Who [[H4310]] are you [[H859]] that you fear [[H3372]] mortal [[H4191]] man, [[H582]] or a son [[H1121]] of man [[H120]] who withers [[H5414]] like grass? [[H2682]]

###### 13
But you have forgotten [[H7911]] the LORD, [[H3068]] your Maker, [[H6213]] who stretched out [[H5186]] the heavens [[H8064]] and laid the foundations [[H3245]] of the earth. [[H776]] You live in terror [[H6342]] all day long [[H3605]] because of [[H6440]] the fury [[H2534]] of the oppressor, [[H6693]] who [[H834]] is bent [[H3559]] on destruction. [[H7843]] But where [[H346]] is the fury [[H2534]] of the oppressor? [[H6693]]

###### 14
The captive [[H6808]] will soon [[H4116]] be freed; [[H6605]] he will not [[H3808]] die [[H4191]] in the dungeon, [[H7845]] and his bread [[H3899]] will not [[H3808]] be lacking. [[H2637]]

###### 15
For I [[H595]] am the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] who stirs up [[H7280]] the sea [[H3220]] so that its waves [[H1530]] roar— [[H1993]] the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts [[H6635]] [is] His name. [[H8034]]

###### 16
I have put [[H7760]] My words [[H1697]] in your mouth, [[H6310]] and covered [[H3680]] you in the shadow [[H6738]] of My hand, [[H3027]] to establish [[H5193]] the heavens, [[H8064]] to found [[H3245]] the earth, [[H776]] and to say [[H559]] to Zion, [[H6726]] “You [[H859]] are My people.” [[H5971]]

###### 17
Awaken, [[H5782]] awaken! [[H5782]] Rise up, [[H6965]] O Jerusalem, [[H3389]] you who [[H834]] have drunk [[H8354]] from the hand [[H3027]] of the LORD [[H3068]] the cup [[H3563]] of His fury; [[H2534]] you who have drained [[H8354]] the goblet [[H6907]] to the dregs, [[H4680]] the cup [[H3563]] that makes men stagger. [[H8653]]

###### 18
Among all [[H3605]] the sons [[H1121]] she bore, [[H3205]] there is no [[H369]] one to guide [[H5095]] her;  among all [[H3605]] the sons [[H1121]] she brought up, [[H1431]] there is no [[H369]] one to take [[H2388]] her hand. [[H3027]]

###### 19
These [[H2007]] pairs [[H8147]] have befallen you: [[H7122]] devastation [[H7701]] and destruction, [[H7667]] famine [[H7458]] and sword. [[H2719]] Who [[H4310]] will grieve for you? [[H5110]] Who [[H4310]] can comfort you? [[H5162]]

###### 20
Your sons [[H1121]] have fainted; [[H5968]] they lie [[H7901]] at the head [[H7218]] of every [[H3605]] street, [[H2351]] like an antelope [[H8377]] in a net. [[H4364]] They are full [[H4390]] of the wrath [[H2534]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] the rebuke [[H1606]] of your God. [[H430]]

###### 21
Therefore [[H3651]] now [[H4994]] hear [[H8085]] this, [[H2063]] you afflicted one, [[H6041]] drunken, [[H7937]] but not [[H3808]] with wine. [[H3196]]

###### 22
Thus [[H3541]] says [[H559]] your Lord, [[H136]] the LORD, [[H3068]] even your God, [[H430]] who defends [[H7378]] His people: [[H5971]] “See, [[H2009]] I have removed [[H3947]] the cup [[H3563]] of staggering [[H8653]] from your hand; [[H3027]] from that goblet, [[H6907]] the cup [[H3563]] of My fury, [[H2534]] you will never [[H3808]] drink [[H8354]] again. [[H3254]]

###### 23
I will place it [[H7760]] in the hands [[H3027]] of your tormentors, [[H3013]] who [[H834]] told [[H559]] you: [[H5315]] ‘Lie down, [[H7812]] so we can walk over you.’ [[H5674]] And you made [[H7760]] your back [[H1460]] like the ground, [[H776]] and like a street [[H2351]] to be traversed. [[H5674]]
