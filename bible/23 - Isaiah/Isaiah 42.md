# Isaiah 42

[[Isaiah 41|←]] • [[Isaiah 43|→]]

---

###### 1
Here is [[H2005]] My Servant, [[H5650]] whom I uphold, [[H8551]] My Chosen One, [[H972]] [in whom] My soul [[H5315]] delights. [[H7521]] I will put [[H5414]] My Spirit [[H7307]] on Him, [[H5921]] [and] He will bring [[H3318]] justice [[H4941]] to the nations. [[H1471]]

###### 2
He will not [[H3808]] cry out [[H6817]] [or] [[H3808]] raise [His voice], [[H5375]] nor [[H3808]] make His voice [[H6963]] heard [[H8085]] in the streets. [[H2351]]

###### 3
A bruised [[H7533]] reed [[H7070]] He will not [[H3808]] break [[H7665]] and a smoldering [[H3544]] wick [[H6594]] He will not [[H3808]] extinguish; [[H3518]] He will faithfully [[H571]] bring forth [[H3318]] justice. [[H4941]]

###### 4
He will not [[H3808]] grow weak [[H3543]] or discouraged [[H7533]] until [[H5704]] He has established [[H7760]] justice [[H4941]] on the earth. [[H776]] In His law [[H8451]] the islands [[H339]] will put their hope.” [[H3176]]

###### 5
Thus [[H3541]] says [[H559]] God [[H410]] the LORD— [[H3068]] He who created [[H1254]] the heavens [[H8064]] and stretched them out, [[H5186]] who spread out [[H7554]] the earth [[H776]] and its offspring, [[H6631]] who gives [[H5414]] breath [[H5397]] to the people [[H5971]] on it [[H5921]] and life [[H7307]] to those who walk [[H1980]] in it— 

###### 6
“I, [[H589]] the LORD, [[H3068]] have called you [[H7121]] for a righteous purpose, [[H6664]] and I will take hold [[H2388]] of your hand. [[H3027]] I will keep you [[H5341]] and appoint you [[H5414]] to be a covenant [[H1285]] for the people [[H5971]] and a light [[H216]] to the nations, [[H1471]]

###### 7
to open [[H6491]] the eyes [[H5869]] of the blind, [[H5787]] to bring [[H3318]] prisoners [[H616]] out of the dungeon, [[H4525]] and those sitting [[H3427]] in darkness [[H2822]] out from the prison [[H3608]] house. [[H1004]]

###### 8
I [[H589]] am the LORD; [[H3068]] that [[H1931]] is My name! [[H8034]] I will not [[H3808]] give [[H5414]] My glory [[H3519]] to another [[H312]] or My praise [[H8416]] to idols. [[H6456]]

###### 9
Behold, [[H2009]] the former things [[H7223]] have happened, [[H935]] and now I [[H589]] declare [[H5046]] new things. [[H2319]] Before [[H2962]] they spring forth [[H6779]] I proclaim [[H8085]] them [[H853]] to you.” 

###### 10
Sing [[H7891]] to the LORD [[H3068]] a new [[H2319]] song, [[H7892]] His praise [[H8416]] from the ends [[H7097]] of the earth, [[H776]] you who go down [[H3381]] to the sea, [[H3220]] and all that is in it, [[H4393]] you islands, [[H339]] and all who dwell there. [[H3427]]

###### 11
Let the desert [[H4057]] and its cities [[H5892]] raise their voices; [[H5375]] [let] the villages [[H2691]] of Kedar [cry aloud]. [[H6938]] Let the people [[H3427]] of Sela [[H5554]] sing for joy; [[H7442]] let them cry out [[H6681]] from the mountaintops. [[H7218]]

###### 12
Let them give [[H7760]] glory [[H3519]] to the LORD [[H3068]] and declare [[H5046]] His praise [[H8416]] in the islands. [[H339]]

###### 13
The LORD [[H3068]] will go forth [[H3318]] like a warrior; [[H1368]] He will stir up [[H5782]] His zeal [[H7068]] like a soldier. [[H376]] He will shout; [[H7321]] yes, [[H637]] He will roar. [[H6873]] He will prevail [[H1396]] against [[H5921]] His enemies. [[H341]]

###### 14
I have kept silent [[H2814]] from ages past; [[H5769]] I have kept quiet [[H2790]] and restrained. [[H662]] But now I will groan [[H6463]] like a woman in labor; [[H3205]] I will at once [[H3162]] gasp [[H5395]] and pant. [[H7602]]

###### 15
I will lay waste [[H2717]] the mountains [[H2022]] and hills [[H1389]] and dry up [[H3001]] all [[H3605]] their vegetation. [[H6212]] I will turn [[H7760]] the rivers [[H5104]] into islands [[H339]] and dry up [[H3001]] the marshes. [[H98]]

###### 16
I will lead [[H1980]] the blind [[H5787]] by a way [[H1870]] they did not [[H3808]] know; [[H3045]] I will guide them [[H1869]] on unfamiliar [[H3808]] paths. [[H5410]] I will turn [[H7760]] darkness [[H4285]] into light [[H216]] before them [[H6440]] and rough places [[H4625]] into level ground. [[H4334]] These [[H428]] things [[H1697]] I will do for them, [[H6213]] and I will not [[H3808]] forsake them. [[H5800]]

###### 17
But those who trust [[H982]] in idols [[H6459]] and say [[H559]] to molten images: [[H4541]] ‘You [[H859]] are our gods!’ [[H430]] will be turned [[H5472]] back [[H268]] in utter [[H1322]] shame. [[H954]]

###### 18
“Listen, [[H8085]] you deaf, [[H2795]] and look, [[H5027]] you blind, [[H5787]] that you may see. [[H7200]]

###### 19
Who [[H4310]] is blind [[H5787]] but [[H3588]] My servant, [[H5650]] or deaf [[H2795]] like the messenger [[H4397]] I am sending? [[H7971]] Who [[H4310]] is blind [[H5787]] like My covenant partner, [[H7999]] or blind [[H5787]] like the servant [[H5650]] of the LORD? [[H3068]]

###### 20
Though seeing [[H7200]] many things, [[H7227]] you do not [[H3808]] observe. [[H8104]] Though your ears [[H241]] are open, [[H6491]] you hear [[H8085]] nothing.” [[H3808]]

###### 21
The LORD [[H3068]] was pleased [[H2654]] for the sake of [[H4616]] His righteousness, [[H6664]] to magnify [[H1431]] His law [[H8451]] and make it glorious. [[H142]]

###### 22
But this [[H1931]] is a people [[H5971]] plundered [[H962]] and looted, [[H8154]] all [[H3605]] trapped [[H6351]] in caves [[H2352]] or imprisoned [[H2244]] in dungeons. [[H1004]] They have become [[H1961]] plunder [[H957]] with no [[H369]] one to rescue them, [[H5337]] and loot [[H4933]] with no [[H369]] one to say, [[H559]] “Send them back!” [[H7725]]

###### 23
Who [[H4310]] among you  will pay attention [[H238]] to this? [[H2063]] [Who] will listen [[H7181]] and obey [[H8085]] hereafter? [[H268]]

###### 24
Who [[H4310]] gave [[H5414]] Jacob [[H3290]] up for spoil, [[H4882]] and Israel [[H3478]] to the plunderers? [[H962]] Was it not [[H3808]] the LORD, [[H3069]] against whom [[H2098]] we have sinned? [[H2398]] They were unwilling [[H14]] to walk [[H1980]] in His ways, [[H1870]] and they would not [[H3808]] obey [[H8085]] His law. [[H8451]]

###### 25
So He poured out [[H8210]] on them [[H5921]] His furious [[H2534]] anger [[H639]] and the fierceness [[H5807]] of battle. [[H4421]] It enveloped them [[H5439]] in flames, [[H3857]] but they did not [[H3808]] understand; [[H3045]] it consumed them, [[H1197]] but they did not [[H3808]] take [[H7760]] it to [[H5921]] heart. [[H3820]]
