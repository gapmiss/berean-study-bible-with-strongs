[[Isaiah 7|←]] • [[Isaiah 9|→]]

### 1
Then the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H559]] to me, [[H413]] “Take [[H3947]] a large [[H1419]] scroll [[H1549]] and write [[H3789]] on [[H5921]] it with an ordinary [[H582]] stylus: [[H2747]] Maher-Shalal-Hash-Baz. [[H4122]]

### 2
And I will appoint [[H5749]] for myself  trustworthy [[H539]] witnesses— [[H5707]] Uriah [[H223]] the priest [[H3548]] and Zechariah [[H2148]] son [[H1121]] of Jeberekiah.” [[H3000]]

### 3
And I had relations [[H7126]] with [[H413]] the prophetess, [[H5031]] and she conceived [[H2029]] and gave birth to [[H3205]] a son. [[H1121]] The LORD [[H3068]] said [[H559]] to me, [[H413]] “Name [[H7121]] him [[H8034]] Maher-Shalal-Hash-Baz. [[H4122]]

### 4
For [[H3588]] before [[H2962]] the boy [[H5288]] knows [[H3045]] how to cry [[H7121]] ‘Father’ [[H1]] or ‘Mother,’ [[H517]] the wealth [[H2428]] of Damascus [[H1834]] and the plunder [[H7998]] of Samaria [[H8111]] will be carried off [[H5375]] to [[H6440]] the king [[H4428]] of Assyria.” [[H804]]

### 5
And the LORD [[H3068]] spoke [[H1696]] to [[H413]] me [[H3254]] further: [[H5750]]

### 6
“Because [[H3282]] this [[H2088]] people [[H5971]] has rejected [[H3988]] the gently [[H328]] flowing [[H1980]] waters [[H4325]] of Shiloah [[H7975]] and rejoiced [[H4885]] in Rezin [[H7526]] and the son [[H1121]] of Remaliah, [[H7425]]

### 7
the Lord [[H136]] will surely [[H2009]] bring [[H5927]] against them [[H5921]] the mighty [[H6099]] rushing [[H7227]] waters [[H4325]] of the Euphrates— [[H5104]] the king [[H4428]] of Assyria [[H804]] and all [[H3605]] his pomp. [[H3519]] It will overflow [[H5927]] its channels [[H650]] and run [[H1980]] over [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] its banks. [[H1415]]

### 8
It will pour [[H2498]] into Judah, [[H3063]] swirling [[H7857]] and sweeping over it, [[H5674]] reaching [[H5060]] up to [[H5704]] the neck; [[H6677]] its spreading streams [[H4298]] will cover [[H4393]] your entire [[H7341]] land, [[H776]] O Immanuel! [[H6005]]

### 9
Huddle together, [[H7489]] O peoples, [[H5971]] and be shattered; [[H2865]] pay attention, [[H238]] all [[H3605]] you distant [[H4801]] lands; [[H776]] prepare for battle, [[H247]] and be broken; [[H2865]] prepare for battle, [[H247]] and be dismayed. [[H2865]]

### 10
Devise [[H5779]] a plan, [[H6098]] but it will be thwarted; [[H6565]] state [[H1696]] a proposal, [[H1697]] but it will not [[H3808]] happen. [[H6965]] For [[H3588]] God [[H410]] is with us.” [[H5973]]

### 11
For [[H3588]] this is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] spoke [[H559]] to me [[H413]] with a strong [[H2393]] hand, [[H3027]] instructing me [[H3256]] not to walk [[H1980]] in the way [[H1870]] of this [[H2088]] people: [[H5971]]

### 12
“Do not [[H3808]] call [[H559]] conspiracy [[H7195]] everything [[H3605]] these [[H2088]] people [[H5971]] regard [[H559]] as conspiracy. [[H7195]] Do not [[H3808]] fear [[H3372]] what they fear; [[H4172]] do not [[H3808]] live in dread. [[H6206]]

### 13
The LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts [[H6635]] is the One [[H853]] to regard as holy. [[H6942]] Only He [[H1931]] should be feared; [[H4172]] only He [[H1931]] should be dreaded, [[H6206]]

### 14
and He will be [[H1961]] a sanctuary. [[H4720]] But to both [[H8147]] houses [[H1004]] of Israel [[H3478]] He will be a stone [[H68]] of stumbling [[H5063]] and a rock [[H6697]] of offense, [[H4383]] a trap [[H6341]] and a snare [[H4170]] to the dwellers [[H3427]] of Jerusalem.” [[H3389]]

### 15
Many [[H7227]] will stumble over these; [[H3782]] they will fall [[H5307]] and be broken; [[H7665]] they will be ensnared [[H3369]] and captured. [[H3920]]

### 16
Bind up [[H6887]] the testimony [[H8584]] [and] seal [[H2856]] the law [[H8451]] among my disciples. [[H3928]]

### 17
I will wait [[H2442]] for the LORD, [[H3068]] who is hiding [[H5641]] His face [[H6440]] from the house [[H1004]] of Jacob. [[H3290]] I will put my trust [[H6960]] in Him. 

### 18
Here [[H2009]] am I, [[H595]] and the children [[H3206]] the LORD [[H3068]] has given [[H5414]] me  to be signs [[H226]] and symbols [[H4159]] in Israel [[H3478]] from [[H5973]] the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts, [[H6635]] who dwells [[H7931]] on Mount [[H2022]] Zion. [[H6726]]

### 19
When [[H3588]] men tell [[H559]] you [[H413]] to consult [[H1875]] the spirits of the dead [[H178]] and the spiritists [[H3049]] who whisper [[H6850]] and mutter, [[H1897]] shouldn’t [[H3808]] a people [[H5971]] consult [[H1875]] their God [instead]? [[H430]] Why consult the dead [[H4191]] on behalf of [[H1157]] the living? [[H2416]]

### 20
To the law [[H8451]] and to the testimony! [[H8584]] If [[H518]] they do not [[H3808]] speak [[H559]] according to this [[H2088]] word, [[H1697]] they have no [[H369]] light of dawn. [[H7837]]

### 21
They will roam the land, [[H5674]] dejected [[H7185]] and hungry. [[H7457]] When [[H3588]] they are famished, [[H7456]] they will become enraged, [[H7107]] and looking [[H6437]] upward, [[H4605]] they will curse [[H7043]] their king [[H4428]] and their God. [[H430]]

### 22
Then they will look [[H5027]] to [[H413]] the earth [[H776]] and see [[H2009]] only distress [[H6869]] and darkness [[H2825]] and the gloom [[H4588]] of anguish. [[H6695]] And they will be driven [[H5080]] into utter darkness. [[H653]]
