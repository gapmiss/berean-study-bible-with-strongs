# Isaiah 1

[[Song of Solomon 8|←]] • [[Isaiah 2|→]]

---

### 1
[This is] the vision [[H2377]] concerning [[H5921]] Judah [[H3063]] and Jerusalem [[H3389]] that [[H834]] Isaiah [[H3470]] son [[H1121]] of Amoz [[H531]] saw [[H2372]] during the reigns [[H3117]] of Uzziah, [[H5818]] Jotham, [[H3147]] Ahaz, [[H271]] and Hezekiah, [[H2396]] kings [[H4428]] of Judah. [[H3063]]

### 2
Listen, [[H8085]] O heavens, [[H8064]] and give ear, [[H238]] O earth, [[H776]] for [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] has spoken: [[H1696]] “I have raised [[H1431]] children [[H1121]] and brought them up, [[H7311]] but they [[H1992]] have rebelled [[H6586]] against Me. 

### 3
The ox [[H7794]] knows [[H3045]] its owner, [[H7069]] and the donkey [[H2543]] its master’s [[H1167]] manger, [[H18]] but Israel [[H3478]] does not [[H3808]] know; [[H3045]] My people [[H5971]] do not [[H3808]] understand.” [[H995]]

### 4
Alas, [[H1945]] O sinful [[H2398]] nation, [[H1471]] a people [[H5971]] laden [[H3515]] with iniquity, [[H5771]] a brood [[H2233]] of evildoers, [[H7489]] children [[H1121]] of depravity! [[H7843]] They have forsaken [[H5800]] the LORD; [[H3068]] they have despised [[H5006]] the Holy [[H6918]] One of Israel [[H3478]] [and] turned [[H2114]] their backs on Him. [[H268]]

### 5
Why [[H5921]] do you want more [[H5750]] beatings? [[H5221]] Why do you keep [[H3254]] rebelling? [[H5627]] Your head [[H7218]] has a massive [[H3605]] wound, [[H2483]] and your whole [[H3605]] heart [[H3824]] is afflicted. [[H1742]]

### 6
From the sole [[H3709]] of your foot [[H7272]] to the top [[H5704]] of your head, [[H7218]] [there is] no [[H369]] soundness— [[H4974]] only wounds [[H6482]] and welts [[H2250]] and festering [[H2961]] sores [[H4347]] not [[H3808]] cleansed [[H2115]] [or] [[H3808]] bandaged [[H2280]] or soothed [[H7401]] with oil. [[H8081]]

### 7
Your land [[H776]] is desolate, [[H8077]] your cities [[H5892]] [are] burned [[H8313]] with fire; [[H784]] foreigners [[H2114]] devour [[H398]] your fields [[H127]] before you -- [[H5048]] a desolation [[H8077]] demolished [[H4114]] by strangers. [[H2114]]

### 8
And the daughter [[H1323]] of Zion [[H6726]] is abandoned [[H3498]] like a shelter [[H5521]] in a vineyard, [[H3754]] like a shack [[H4412]] in a cucumber field, [[H4750]] like a city [[H5892]] besieged. [[H5341]]

### 9
Unless [[H3884]] the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts [[H6635]] had left [[H3498]] us  a few [[H4592]] survivors, [[H8300]] we would have become [[H1961]] like Sodom, [[H5467]] we would have resembled [[H1819]] Gomorrah. [[H6017]]

### 10
Hear [[H8085]] the word [[H1697]] of the LORD, [[H3069]] you rulers [[H7101]] of Sodom; [[H5467]] listen [[H238]] to the instruction [[H8451]] of our God, [[H430]] you people [[H5971]] of Gomorrah! [[H6017]]

### 11
“What is [[H4100]] your multitude [[H7230]] of sacrifices [[H2077]] to Me?”  says [[H559]] the LORD. [[H3068]] “I am full [[H7646]] from the burnt offerings [[H5930]] of rams [[H352]] and the fat [[H2459]] of well-fed cattle; [[H4806]] I take no delight [[H2654]] in the blood [[H1818]] of bulls, [[H6499]] of lambs [[H3532]] and goats. [[H6260]]

### 12
When [[H3588]] you come [[H935]] to appear [[H7200]] before Me, [[H6440]] who [[H4310]] has required [[H1245]] this [[H2063]] of you— [[H3027]] this trampling [[H7429]] of My courts? [[H2691]]

### 13
Bring [[H935]] your worthless [[H7723]] offerings [[H4503]] no [[H3808]] more; [[H3254]] your incense [[H7004]] is detestable [[H8441]] to Me—  [your] New Moons, [[H2320]] Sabbaths, [[H7676]] and convocations— [[H7121]] I cannot [[H3808]] endure [[H3201]] iniquity [[H205]] in a solemn assembly. [[H6116]]

### 14
I [[H5315]] hate [[H8130]] your New Moons [[H2320]] and your appointed feasts; [[H4150]] they have become [[H1961]] a burden [[H2960]] to Me; [[H5921]] I am weary [[H3811]] of bearing them. [[H5375]]

### 15
When you spread out [[H6566]] your hands in prayer, [[H3709]] I will hide [[H5956]] My eyes [[H5869]] from you; [[H4480]] even [[H1571]] though [[H3588]] you multiply [[H7235]] your prayers, [[H8605]] I will not [[H369]] listen. [[H8085]] Your hands [[H3027]] are covered [[H4390]] with blood. [[H1818]]

### 16
Wash [[H7364]] and cleanse yourselves. [[H2135]] Remove [[H5493]] your evil [[H7455]] deeds [[H4611]] from [[H5048]] My sight. [[H5869]] Stop [[H2308]] doing evil! [[H7489]]

### 17
Learn [[H3925]] to do right, [[H3190]] seek [[H1875]] justice, [[H4941]] correct [[H833]] the oppressor, [[H2541]] defend [[H8199]] the fatherless, [[H3490]] plead [[H7378]] for the widow.” [[H490]]

### 18
“Come [[H1980]] now, [[H4994]] let us reason together,” [[H3198]] says [[H559]] the LORD. [[H3068]] “Though [[H518]] your sins [[H2399]] are [[H1961]] like scarlet, [[H8144]] they will be as white [[H3835]] as snow; [[H7950]] though [[H518]] they are as red [[H119]] as crimson, [[H8438]] they will become [[H1961]] like wool. [[H6785]]

### 19
If [[H518]] you are willing [[H14]] and obedient, [[H8085]] you will eat [[H398]] the best [[H2898]] of the land. [[H776]]

### 20
But if [[H518]] you resist [[H3985]] and rebel, [[H4784]] you will be devoured [[H398]] by the sword.” [[H2719]] For [[H3588]] the mouth [[H6310]] of the LORD [[H3068]] has spoken. [[H1696]]

### 21
[See] how [[H349]] the faithful [[H539]] city [[H7151]] has become [[H1961]] a harlot! [[H2181]] She once was full of justice; [[H4941]] righteousness [[H6664]] resided [[H3885]] within her,  but now only [[H6258]] murderers! [[H7523]]

### 22
Your silver [[H3701]] has become [[H1961]] dross, [[H5509]] your fine wine [[H5435]] is diluted [[H4107]] with water. [[H4325]]

### 23
Your rulers [[H8269]] are rebels, [[H5637]] friends [[H2270]] of thieves. [[H1590]] They all [[H3605]] love [[H157]] bribes [[H7810]] and chasing after [[H7291]] rewards. [[H8021]] They do not [[H3808]] defend [[H8199]] the fatherless, [[H3490]] and the plea [[H7379]] of the widow [[H490]] never [[H3808]] comes [[H935]] before them. [[H413]]

### 24
Therefore [[H3651]] the Lord [[H113]] GOD [[H3068]] of Hosts, [[H6635]] the Mighty [[H46]] One of Israel, [[H3478]] declares: [[H5002]] “Ah, [[H1945]] I will be relieved [[H5162]] of My foes [[H6862]] and avenge Myself [[H5358]] on My enemies. [[H341]]

### 25
I will turn [[H7725]] My hand [[H3027]] against you; [[H5921]] I will thoroughly purge [[H6884]] your dross; [[H5509]] I will remove [[H5493]] all [[H3605]] your impurities. [[H913]]

### 26
I will restore [[H7725]] your judges [[H8199]] as at the first, [[H7223]] and your counselors [[H3289]] as at the beginning. [[H8462]] After that [[H310]] you will be called [[H7121]] the City [[H5892]] of Righteousness, [[H6664]] the Faithful [[H539]] City.” [[H7151]]

### 27
Zion [[H6726]] will be redeemed [[H6299]] with justice, [[H4941]] her repentant ones [[H7725]] with righteousness. [[H6666]]

### 28
But rebels [[H6586]] and sinners [[H2400]] will together [[H3162]] be shattered, [[H7667]] and those who forsake [[H5800]] the LORD [[H3068]] will perish. [[H3615]]

### 29
Surely [[H3588]] you will be ashamed [[H954]] of the sacred oaks [[H352]] in which you have delighted; [[H2530]] you will be embarrassed [[H2659]] by the gardens [[H1593]] that [[H834]] you have chosen. [[H977]]

### 30
For [[H3588]] you will become [[H1961]] like an oak [[H424]] whose leaves [[H5929]] are withered, [[H5034]] like a garden [[H1593]] without [[H369]] water. [[H4325]]

### 31
The strong man [[H2634]] will become [[H1961]] tinder [[H5296]] and his work [[H6467]] [will be] a spark; [[H5213]] both [[H8147]] will burn [[H1197]] together, [[H3162]] with no one [[H369]] to quench the flames. [[H3518]]
