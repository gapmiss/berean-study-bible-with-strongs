[[Isaiah 26|←]] • [[Isaiah 28|→]]

### 1
In that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] the LORD [[H3068]] [will take] His sharp, [[H7186]] great, [[H1419]] and mighty [[H2389]] sword, [[H2719]] and bring judgment [[H6485]] on [[H5921]] Leviathan, [[H3882]] the fleeing [[H1281]] serpent— [[H5175]] Leviathan, [[H3882]] the coiling [[H6129]] serpent— [[H5175]] and He will slay [[H2026]] the dragon [[H8577]] of the sea. [[H3220]]

### 2
In that [[H1931]] day: [[H3117]] “Sing [[H6030]] about a fruitful [[H2531]] vineyard. [[H3754]]

### 3
I, [[H589]] the LORD, [[H3068]] am its keeper; [[H5341]] I water it continually. [[H8248]] I guard [[H5341]] it night [[H3915]] and day [[H3117]] so no one [[H6435]] can disturb it. [[H6485]]

### 4
I am not [[H369]] angry. [[H2534]] If only thorns [[H7898]] and briers [[H8068]] confronted Me, [[H5414]] I would march [[H4421]] and trample them, [[H6585]] I would burn them [[H6702]] to the ground. [[H3162]]

### 5
Or [[H176]] let them lay claim [[H2388]] to My protection; [[H4581]] let them make [[H6213]] peace with Me— [[H7965]] [yes,] let them make [[H6213]] peace with Me.” [[H7965]]

### 6
In the days to come, [[H935]] Jacob [[H3290]] will take root. [[H8327]] Israel [[H3478]] will bud [[H6524]] and blossom [[H6692]] and fill [[H4390]] the whole world [[H6440]] with fruit. [[H8570]]

### 7
Has the LORD struck Israel [[H5221]] as He struck [[H4347]] her oppressors? [[H5221]] Was she killed [[H2026]] like those who slayed her? [[H2027]]

### 8
By warfare [[H5432]] and exile [[H7971]] You contended with her [[H7378]] and removed her [[H1898]] with a fierce [[H7186]] wind [[H7307]] like the day [[H3117]] of the east wind. [[H6921]]

### 9
Therefore [[H3651]] Jacob’s [[H3290]] guilt [[H5771]] will be atoned for, [[H3722]] and the fruit [[H6529]] of the removal [[H5493]] of his sin [[H2403]] will be this: [[H2088]] When he makes [[H7760]] all [[H3605]] the altar [[H4196]] stones [[H68]] like crushed [[H5310]] bits of chalk, [[H1615]] no [[H3808]] Asherah poles [[H842]] or incense altars [[H2553]] will remain standing. [[H6965]]

### 10
For [[H3588]] the fortified [[H1219]] city [[H5892]] will be deserted, [[H910]] a homestead [[H5116]] abandoned [[H7971]] and forsaken [[H5800]] like a wilderness. [[H4057]] There [[H8033]] the calves [[H5695]] will graze, [[H7462]] and there [[H8033]] they will lie down [[H7257]] and strip [[H3615]] its branches {bare}. [[H5585]]

### 11
When its limbs [[H7105]] are dry, [[H3001]] they will be broken off. [[H7665]] Women [[H802]] will come [[H935]] and use them for kindling, [[H215]] for [[H3588]] they are [[H1931]] a people [[H5971]] without [[H3808]] understanding. [[H998]] Therefore [[H5921]] their Maker [[H6213]] will have no [[H3808]] compassion on them, [[H7355]] and their Creator [[H3335]] will show them no [[H3808]] grace. [[H2603]]

### 12
In that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] the LORD [[H3069]] will thresh [[H2251]] from the flowing [[H7641]] Euphrates [[H5104]] to [[H5704]] the Wadi [[H5158]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] and you, [[H859]] O Israelites, [[H1121]] will be gathered [[H3950]] one [[H259]] by one. [[H259]]

### 13
And [[H1961]] in that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] a great [[H1419]] trumpet [[H7782]] will sound, [[H8628]] and those who were perishing [[H6]] in Assyria [[H804]] will come forth [[H935]] with those who were exiles [[H5080]] in Egypt. [[H4714]] And they will worship [[H7812]] the LORD [[H3068]] on the holy [[H6944]] mountain [[H2022]] in Jerusalem. [[H3389]]
