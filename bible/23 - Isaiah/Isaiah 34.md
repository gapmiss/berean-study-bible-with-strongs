# Isaiah 34

[[Isaiah 33|←]] • [[Isaiah 35|→]]

---

###### 1
Come near, [[H7126]] O nations, [[H1471]] to listen; [[H8085]] pay attention, [[H7181]] O peoples. [[H3816]] Let the earth [[H776]] hear, [[H8085]] and all that fills it, [[H4393]] the world [[H8398]] and all [[H3605]] that springs from it. [[H6631]]

###### 2
The LORD [[H3068]] is angry [[H7110]] with [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] the nations [[H1471]] and furious [[H2534]] with all their armies. [[H6635]] He will set them apart for destruction; [[H2763]] He will give them over [[H5414]] to slaughter. [[H2874]]

###### 3
Their slain [[H2491]] will be left unburied, [[H7993]] and the stench [[H889]] of their corpses [[H6297]] will rise; [[H5927]] the mountains [[H2022]] will flow [[H4549]] with their blood. [[H1818]]

###### 4
All [[H3605]] the stars [[H6635]] of heaven [[H8064]] will be dissolved. [[H4743]] The skies [[H8064]] will be rolled up [[H1556]] like a scroll, [[H5612]] and all their stars [[H6635]] will fall [[H5034]] like withered [[H5034]] leaves [[H5929]] on the vine, [[H1612]] and foliage [[H5034]] on the fig tree. [[H8384]]

###### 5
When [[H3588]] My sword [[H2719]] has drunk its fill [[H7301]] in the heavens, [[H8064]] then [[H2009]] it will come down [[H3381]] upon [[H5921]] Edom, [[H123]] on [[H5921]] the people [[H5971]] I have set apart [[H2764]] for destruction. [[H4941]]

###### 6
The sword [[H2719]] of the LORD [[H3068]] is bathed [[H4390]] in blood. [[H1818]] It drips [[H1878]] with fat— [[H2459]] with the blood [[H1818]] of lambs [[H3733]] and goats, [[H6260]] with the fat [[H2459]] of the kidneys [[H3629]] of rams. [[H352]] For [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] has a sacrifice [[H2077]] in Bozrah, [[H1224]] a great [[H1419]] slaughter [[H2874]] in the land [[H776]] of Edom. [[H123]]

###### 7
And the wild oxen [[H7214]] will fall [[H3381]] with them, [[H5973]] the young bulls [[H6499]] with [[H5973]] the strong [ones]. [[H47]] Their land [[H776]] will be drenched [[H7301]] with blood, [[H1818]] and their soil [[H6083]] will be soaked [[H1878]] with fat. [[H2459]]

###### 8
For [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] has a day [[H3117]] of vengeance, [[H5359]] a time [[H8141]] of retribution [[H7966]] for [Edom’s] hostility [[H7379]] against Zion. [[H6726]]

###### 9
Her streams [[H5158]] will be turned [[H2015]] to tar, [[H2203]] and her soil [[H6083]] to sulfur; [[H1614]] her land [[H776]] will become [[H1961]] a blazing [[H1197]] pitch. [[H2203]]

###### 10
It will not [[H3808]] be quenched— [[H3518]] day [[H3119]] or night. [[H3915]] Its smoke [[H6227]] will ascend [[H5927]] forever. [[H5769]] From generation [[H1755]] to generation [[H1755]] it will lie desolate; [[H2717]] no one [[H369]] will ever pass [[H5674]] through it [[H5331]] [again]. [[H5331]]

###### 11
The desert owl [[H6893]] and screech owl [[H7090]] will possess it, [[H3423]] and the great owl [[H3244]] and raven [[H6158]] will dwell [[H7931]] in it.  The LORD will stretch out [[H5186]] over [Edom] [[H5921]] a measuring line [[H6957]] of chaos [[H8414]] and a plumb line [[H68]] of destruction. [[H922]]

###### 12
No [[H369]] nobles [[H2715]] will be left to proclaim [[H7121]] a king, [[H4410]] and all [[H3605]] her princes [[H8269]] will come [[H1961]] to nothing. [[H657]]

###### 13
Her towers [[H759]] will be overgrown [[H5927]] with thorns, [[H5518]] her fortresses [[H4013]] with thistles [[H7057]] and briers. [[H2336]] She will become [[H1961]] a haunt [[H5116]] for jackals, [[H8577]] an abode [[H2681]] for ostriches. [[H3284]]

###### 14
The desert creatures [[H6728]] will meet [[H6298]] with hyenas, [[H338]] and one wild goat [[H8163]] will call [[H7121]] to [[H5921]] another. [[H7453]] There [[H8033]] the nocturnal creature [[H3917]] will settle [[H7280]] and find [[H4672]] her  place of repose. [[H4494]]

###### 15
There [[H8033]] the owl will [[H7091]] make her nest; [[H7077]] she will lay [[H4422]] and hatch her eggs [[H1234]] and gather [[H1716]] her brood under her shadow. [[H6738]] Even [[H389]] there [[H8033]] the birds of prey [[H1772]] will gather, [[H6908]] each [[H802]] with its mate. [[H7468]]

###### 16
Search [[H1875]] and read [[H7121]] the scroll [[H5612]] of the LORD: [[H3068]] Not [[H3808]] one [[H259]] of these [[H2007]] will go missing, [[H5737]] not one [[H802]] will lack [[H6485]] her mate, [[H7468]] because [[H3588]] He [[H1931]] has ordered [[H6680]] it by His mouth, [[H6310]] and He [[H1931]] will gather them [[H6908]] by His Spirit. [[H7307]]

###### 17
He [[H1931]] has allotted [[H5307]] their [[H1992]] portion; [[H1486]] His hand [[H3027]] has distributed [[H2505]] it [[H1992]] by measure. [[H6957]] They will possess [[H3423]] it forever; [[H5704]] they will dwell [[H7931]] in it  from generation [[H1755]] to generation. [[H1755]]
