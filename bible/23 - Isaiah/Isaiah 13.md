[[Isaiah 12|←]] • [[Isaiah 14|→]]

---

### 1
[This is] an oracle [[H4853]] concerning Babylon [[H894]] that [[H834]] Isaiah [[H3470]] son [[H1121]] of Amoz [[H531]] received: [[H2372]]

### 2
Raise [[H5375]] a banner [[H5251]] on [[H5921]] a barren [[H8192]] hilltop; [[H2022]] call aloud [[H7311]] to them.  Wave [[H5130]] your hand, [[H3027]] that they may enter [[H935]] the gates [[H6607]] of the nobles. [[H5081]]

### 3
I [[H589]] have commanded [[H6680]] My sanctified ones; [[H6942]] I have even [[H1571]] summoned [[H7121]] My warriors [[H1368]] to execute My wrath [[H639]] [and] exult [[H5947]] in My triumph. [[H1346]]

### 4
Listen, [[H6963]] a tumult [[H1995]] on the mountains, [[H2022]] like that [[H1823]] of a great [[H7227]] multitude! [[H5971]] Listen, [[H6963]] an uproar [[H7588]] among the kingdoms, [[H4467]] like nations [[H1471]] gathered together! [[H622]] The LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts [[H6635]] musters [[H6485]] an army [[H6635]] for war. [[H4421]]

### 5
They are coming [[H935]] from faraway [[H4801]] lands, [[H776]] from the ends [[H7097]] of the heavens— [[H8064]] the LORD [[H3068]] and the weapons [[H3627]] of His wrath— [[H2195]] to destroy [[H2254]] the whole [[H3605]] country. [[H776]]

### 6
Wail, [[H3213]] for [[H3588]] the Day [[H3117]] of the LORD [[H3068]] is near; [[H7138]] it will come [[H935]] as destruction [[H7701]] from the Almighty. [[H7706]]

### 7
Therefore [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] hands [[H3027]] will fall limp, [[H7503]] and every [[H3605]] man’s [[H582]] heart [[H3824]] will melt. [[H4549]]

### 8
Terror, [[H926]] pain, [[H6735]] and anguish [[H2256]] will seize them; [[H270]] they will writhe [[H2342]] like a woman in labor. [[H3205]] They will look in astonishment at [[H413]] one [[H376]] another, [[H7453]] their faces [[H6440]] aflame [[H3851]] with fear. [[H8539]]

### 9
Behold, [[H2009]] the Day [[H3117]] of the LORD [[H3068]] is coming— [[H935]] cruel, [[H394]] with fury [[H5678]] and burning anger— [[H2740]] to make [[H7760]] the earth [[H776]] a desolation [[H8047]] and to destroy [[H8045]] the sinners [[H2400]] within it. [[H4480]]

### 10
For [[H3588]] the stars [[H3556]] of heaven [[H8064]] and their constellations [[H3685]] will not [[H3808]] give [[H1984]] their light. [[H216]] The sun [[H8121]] will be darkened [[H2821]] when it rises, [[H3318]] and the moon [[H3394]] will not [[H3808]] give [[H5050]] its light. [[H216]]

### 11
I will punish [[H6485]] the world [[H8398]] [for its] evil, [[H7451]] and [[H5921]] the wicked [[H7563]] for their iniquity. [[H5771]] I will end [[H7673]] the haughtiness [[H1347]] of the arrogant [[H2086]] and humiliate [[H8213]] the pride [[H1346]] of tyrants. [[H6184]]

### 12
{I will make} man [[H376]] scarcer [[H3365]] than pure gold, [[H6337]] and mankind [[H120]] rarer than the gold [[H3800]] of Ophir. [[H211]]

### 13
Therefore [[H5921]] I will make the heavens [[H8064]] tremble, [[H7264]] and the earth [[H776]] will be shaken [[H7493]] from its place [[H4725]] at the wrath [[H5678]] of the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts [[H6635]] on the day [[H3117]] of His burning anger. [[H2740]]

### 14
Like a hunted [[H5080]] gazelle [[H6643]] and like a sheep [[H6629]] without [[H369]] a shepherd, [[H6908]] each [[H376]] will return [[H6437]] to [[H413]] his own people, [[H5971]] each [[H376]] will flee [[H5127]] to [[H413]] his native land. [[H776]]

### 15
Whoever [[H3605]] is caught [[H4672]] will be stabbed, [[H1856]] and whoever [[H3605]] is captured [[H5595]] will die [[H5307]] by the sword. [[H2719]]

### 16
Their infants [[H5768]] will be dashed to pieces [[H7376]] before their eyes, [[H5869]] their houses [[H1004]] will be looted, [[H8155]] and their wives [[H802]] will be ravished. [[H7693]]

### 17
Behold, [[H2005]] I will stir up [[H5782]] against them [[H5921]] the Medes, [[H4074]] who [[H834]] have no [[H3808]] regard [[H2803]] for silver [[H3701]] and no [[H3808]] desire [[H2654]] for gold. [[H2091]]

### 18
Their bows [[H7198]] {will dash} young men [[H5288]] to pieces; [[H7376]] they will have no [[H3808]] mercy [[H7355]] on the fruit [[H6529]] of the womb; [[H990]] they will not [[H3808]] look with pity [[H2347]] on [[H5921]] the children. [[H1121]]

### 19
And Babylon, [[H894]] the jewel [[H6643]] of the kingdoms, [[H4467]] the glory [[H8597]] of the pride [[H1347]] of the Chaldeans, [[H3778]] will be [[H1961]] overthrown [[H4114]] by God [[H430]] like Sodom [[H5467]] and Gomorrah. [[H6017]]

### 20
She will never [[H3808]] be inhabited [[H3427]] or [[H3808]] settled [[H7931]] from [[H5704]] generation [[H1755]] to generation; [[H1755]] no [[H3808]] nomad [[H6163]] will pitch his tent [[H167]] there, [[H8033]] no [[H3808]] shepherd [[H7462]] will rest his flock [[H7257]] there. [[H8033]]

### 21
But desert creatures [[H6728]] will lie down [[H7257]] there, [[H8033]] and howling creatures [[H255]] will fill [[H4390]] her houses. [[H1004]] The owls [[H1323]] will dwell [[H7931]] there, [[H8033]] and wild goats [[H8163]] will leap about. [[H7540]]

### 22
Hyenas [[H338]] will howl [[H6030]] in her fortresses [[H490]] and jackals [[H8577]] in her luxurious [[H6027]] palaces. [[H1964]] Babylon’s time [[H6256]] is at hand, [[H7138]] and her days [[H3117]] will not [[H3808]] be prolonged. [[H4900]]
