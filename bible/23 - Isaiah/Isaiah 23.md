[[Isaiah 22|←]] • [[Isaiah 24|→]]

###### 1
[This is] an oracle [[H4853]] concerning Tyre: [[H6865]] Wail, [[H3213]] O ships [[H591]] of Tarshish, [[H8659]] for [[H3588]] [Tyre] is laid waste, [[H7703]] without house [[H1004]] [or] harbor. [[H935]] Word has reached [[H1540]] them  from the land [[H776]] of Cyprus. [[H3794]]

###### 2
Be silent, [[H1826]] O dwellers [[H3427]] of the coastland, [[H339]] you merchants [[H5503]] of Sidon, [[H6721]] whom the seafarers [[H5674]] have enriched. [[H4390]]

###### 3
On the great [[H7227]] waters [[H4325]] came the grain [[H2233]] of Shihor; [[H7883]] the harvest [[H7105]] of the Nile [[H2975]] was the revenue of Tyre; [[H8393]] she was [[H1961]] the merchant [[H5505]] of the nations. [[H1471]]

###### 4
Be ashamed, [[H954]] O Sidon, [[H6721]] the stronghold [[H4581]] of the sea, [[H3220]] for [[H3588]] the sea [[H3220]] has spoken: [[H559]] “I have not [[H3808]] been in labor [[H2342]] or given birth. [[H3205]] I have not [[H3808]] raised [[H1431]] young men [[H970]] or brought up [[H7311]] young women.” [[H1330]]

###### 5
When [[H834]] the report [reaches] [[H8088]] Egypt, [[H4714]] they will writhe in agony [[H2342]] over the news [[H8088]] of Tyre. [[H6865]]

###### 6
Cross over [[H5674]] to Tarshish; [[H8659]] wail, [[H3213]] O inhabitants [[H3427]] of the coastland! [[H339]]

###### 7
Is this [[H2063]] your jubilant city, [[H5947]] whose origin [[H6927]] is from antiquity, [[H6924]] whose feet [[H7272]] have taken her [[H2986]] to settle [[H1481]] far away? [[H7350]]

###### 8
Who [[H4310]] planned [[H3289]] this [[H2063]] against [[H5921]] Tyre, [[H6865]] the bestower of crowns, [[H5849]] whose [[H834]] traders [[H5503]] are princes, [[H8269]] whose merchants [[H3669]] are renowned [[H3513]] on the earth? [[H776]]

###### 9
The LORD [[H3069]] of Hosts [[H6635]] planned it, [[H3289]] to defile [[H2490]] all [[H3605]] its glorious [[H1347]] beauty, [[H6643]] to disgrace [[H7043]] all [[H3605]] the renowned [[H3513]] of the earth. [[H776]]

###### 10
Overflow [[H5674]] your land [[H776]] like the Nile, [[H2975]] O daughter [[H1323]] of Tarshish; [[H8659]] there is no [[H369]] longer [[H5750]] a harbor. [[H4206]]

###### 11
[The LORD] has stretched out [[H5186]] His hand [[H3027]] over [[H5921]] the sea; [[H3220]] He has made kingdoms [[H4467]] tremble. [[H7264]] [He] [[H3068]] has given a command [[H6680]] that [[H413]] the strongholds [[H4581]] of Canaan [[H3667]] be destroyed. [[H8045]]

###### 12
He said, [[H559]] “You shall rejoice [[H5937]] no [[H3808]] more, [[H3254]] O oppressed [[H6231]] virgin [[H1330]] daughter [[H1323]] of Sidon. [[H6721]] Get up [[H6965]] and cross over [[H5674]] to Cyprus— [[H3794]] even [[H1571]] there [[H8033]] you will find no [[H3808]] rest.” [[H5117]]

###### 13
Look at [[H2005]] the land [[H776]] of the [[H2088]] Chaldeans— [[H3778]] a people [[H5971]] now [[H3808]] of no account. [[H1961]] The Assyrians [[H804]] destined it [[H3245]] for the desert creatures; [[H6728]] they set up [[H6965]] their siege towers [[H971]] and stripped [[H6209]] its palaces. [[H759]] They brought it [[H7760]] to ruin. [[H4654]]

###### 14
Wail, [[H3213]] O ships [[H591]] of Tarshish, [[H8659]] for [[H3588]] your harbor [[H4581]] has been destroyed! [[H7703]]

###### 15
At that [[H1931]] time [[H3117]] Tyre [[H6865]] will be forgotten [[H7911]] for seventy [[H7657]] years— [[H8141]] the span [[H3117]] of a [[H259]] king’s life. [[H4428]] But at the end [[H7093]] of seventy [[H7657]] years, [[H8141]] it will happen [[H1961]] to Tyre [[H6865]] as in the song [[H7892]] of the harlot: [[H2181]]

###### 16
Take up [[H3947]] your harp, [[H3658]] stroll through [[H5437]] the city, [[H5892]] O forgotten [[H7911]] harlot; [[H2181]] make sweet [[H3190]] melody, [[H5059]] sing many [[H7235]] a song, [[H7892]] so you will be remembered. [[H2142]]

###### 17
And at [[H1961]] the end [[H7093]] of seventy [[H7657]] years, [[H8141]] the LORD [[H3068]] will restore [[H6485]] Tyre. [[H6865]] Then she will return [[H7725]] to hire [[H868]] as a prostitute [[H2181]] and sell herself [[H854]] to all [[H3605]] the kingdoms [[H4467]] on [[H5921]] the face [[H6440]] of the earth. [[H127]]

###### 18
Yet her profits [[H5504]] and wages [[H868]] will be [[H1961]] set apart [[H6944]] to the LORD; [[H3068]] they will not [[H3808]] be stored [[H686]] or saved, [[H2630]] for [[H3588]] her [[H1961]] profit [[H5504]] will go to those who live [[H3427]] before [[H6440]] the LORD, [[H3068]] for abundant [[H7654]] food [[H398]] and fine [[H6266]] clothes.
