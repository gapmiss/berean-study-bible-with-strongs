# Isaiah 59

[[Isaiah 58|←]] • [[Isaiah 60|→]]

---

###### 1
Surely [[H2005]] the arm [[H3027]] of the LORD [[H3068]] is not [[H3808]] too short [[H7114]] to save, [[H3467]] nor His ear [[H241]] too dull [[H3513]] to hear. [[H8085]]

###### 2
But [[H3588]] your iniquities [[H5771]] have built barriers [[H914]] between you [[H996]] and your God, [[H430]] and your sins [[H2403]] have hidden [[H5641]] [His] face [[H6440]] from you, [[H4480]] so that He will not hear. [[H8085]]

###### 3
For [[H3588]] your hands [[H3709]] are stained [[H1351]] with blood, [[H1818]] and your fingers [[H676]] with iniquity; [[H5771]] your lips [[H8193]] have spoken [[H1696]] lies, [[H8267]] and your tongue [[H3956]] mutters [[H1897]] injustice. [[H5766]]

###### 4
No one [[H369]] calls [[H7121]] for justice; [[H6664]] no one [[H369]] pleads his case [[H8199]] honestly. [[H530]] They rely [[H982]] on [[H5921]] empty [pleas]; [[H8414]] they tell [[H1696]] lies; [[H7723]] they conceive [[H2029]] mischief [[H5999]] and give birth to [[H3205]] iniquity. [[H205]]

###### 5
They hatch [[H1234]] the eggs [[H1000]] of vipers [[H6848]] and weave [[H707]] a spider’s [[H5908]] web. [[H6980]] Whoever eats [[H398]] their eggs [[H1000]] will die; [[H4191]] crack one open, [[H2116]] and a viper [[H660]] is hatched. [[H1234]]

###### 6
Their cobwebs [[H6980]] cannot [[H3808]] be made into [[H1961]] clothing, [[H899]] and they cannot [[H3808]] cover themselves [[H3680]] with their works. [[H4639]] Their deeds [[H4639]] are sinful [[H205]] deeds, [[H4639]] and acts [[H6467]] of violence [[H2555]] are in their hands. [[H3709]]

###### 7
Their feet [[H7272]] run [[H7323]] to evil; [[H7451]] they are swift [[H4116]] to shed [[H8210]] innocent [[H5355]] blood. [[H1818]] Their thoughts [[H4284]] are sinful [[H205]] thoughts; [[H4284]] ruin [[H7701]] and destruction [[H7667]] lie in their wake. [[H4546]]

###### 8
The way [[H1870]] of peace [[H7965]] they have not [[H3808]] known, [[H3045]] and there is no [[H369]] justice [[H4941]] in their tracks. [[H4570]] They have turned them into [[H1992]] crooked [[H6140]] paths; [[H5410]] no one [[H3605]] who treads [[H1869]] on them  will know [[H3045]] peace. [[H7965]]

###### 9
Therefore [[H5921]] justice [[H4941]] is far [[H7368]] from us, [[H4480]] and righteousness [[H6666]] does not [[H3808]] reach us. [[H5381]] We hope [[H6960]] for light, [[H216]] but there [[H2009]] is darkness, [[H2822]] for brightness, [[H5054]] [but] we walk [[H1980]] in gloom. [[H653]]

###### 10
Like the blind, [[H5787]] we feel our way along [[H1659]] the wall, [[H7023]] groping [[H1659]] like those without [[H369]] eyes. [[H5869]] We stumble [[H3782]] at midday [[H6672]] as in the twilight; [[H5399]] among the vigorous [[H820]] we are like the dead. [[H4191]]

###### 11
We all [[H3605]] growl [[H1993]] like bears [[H1677]] and moan [[H1897]] like doves. [[H3123]] We hope [[H6960]] for justice, [[H4941]] but [find] none, [[H369]] for salvation, [[H3444]] but it is far [[H7368]] from us. [[H4480]]

###### 12
For [[H3588]] our transgressions [[H6588]] are multiplied [[H7235]] before You, [[H5048]] and our sins [[H2403]] testify against us. [[H6030]] Our transgressions [[H6588]] are indeed [[H3588]] with us, [[H854]] and we know [[H3045]] our iniquities: [[H5771]]

###### 13
rebelling [[H6586]] and denying [[H3584]] the LORD, [[H3068]] turning away [[H5253]] from [[H310]] our God, [[H430]] speaking [[H1696]] oppression [[H6233]] and revolt, [[H5627]] conceiving [[H2029]] and uttering [[H1897]] lies [[H8267]] from the heart. [[H3820]]

###### 14
So justice [[H4941]] is turned away, [[H5253]] and righteousness [[H6666]] stands [[H5975]] at a distance. [[H7350]] For [[H3588]] truth [[H571]] has stumbled [[H3782]] in the public square, [[H7339]] and honesty [[H5229]] cannot [[H3808]] enter. [[H935]]

###### 15
Truth [[H571]] is [[H1961]] missing, [[H5737]] and whoever turns [[H5493]] from evil [[H7451]] makes himself prey. [[H7997]] The LORD [[H3068]] looked [[H7200]] and was offended [[H7489]] that [[H3588]] there was no [[H369]] justice. [[H4941]]

###### 16
He saw [[H7200]] that [[H3588]] there was no [[H369]] man— [[H376]] He was amazed [[H8074]] that [[H3588]] there was no one [[H369]] to intercede; [[H6293]] so His own arm [[H2220]] brought salvation, [[H3467]] and His own righteousness [[H6666]] sustained Him. [[H5564]]

###### 17
He put on [[H3847]] righteousness [[H6666]] like a breastplate, [[H8302]] and the helmet [[H3553]] of salvation [[H3444]] on His head; [[H7218]] He put on [[H3847]] garments [[H899]] of vengeance [[H5359]] and wrapped Himself [[H5844]] in a cloak [[H4598]] of zeal. [[H7068]]

###### 18
So He will repay [[H7999]] according to [[H5921]] their deeds: [[H1578]] fury [[H2534]] to His enemies, [[H6862]] retribution [[H1576]] to His foes, [[H341]] and recompense [[H1576]] to the islands. [[H339]]

###### 19
So will they fear [[H3372]] the name [[H8034]] of the LORD [[H3068]] from the west [[H4628]] and His glory [[H3519]] from the rising [[H4217]] of the sun; [[H8121]] for [[H3588]] He will come [[H935]] like a rushing [[H6862]] stream, [[H5104]] driven [[H5127]] by the wind [[H7307]] of the LORD. [[H3068]]

###### 20
“The Redeemer [[H1350]] will come [[H935]] to Zion, [[H6726]] to those in Jacob [[H3290]] who turn [[H7725]] from transgression,” [[H6588]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD. [[H3068]]

###### 21
“As for Me, [[H589]] this [[H2063]] is My covenant [[H1285]] with them,” [[H854]] says [[H559]] the LORD. [[H3068]] “My Spirit [[H7307]] who [[H834]] is on you, [[H5921]] and My words [[H1697]] that [[H834]] I have put [[H7760]] in your mouth, [[H6310]] will not [[H3808]] depart [[H4185]] from your mouth, [[H6310]] from the mouths [[H6310]] of your children, [[H2233]] or from the mouths [[H6310]] of your childrens [[H2233]] children, [[H2233]] from now on [[H6258]] and forevermore,” [[H5704]] says [[H559]] the LORD. [[H3068]]
