# Isaiah 58

[[Isaiah 57|←]] • [[Isaiah 59|→]]

---

###### 1
“Cry [[H7121]] aloud, [[H1627]] do not [[H408]] hold back! [[H2820]] Raise [[H7311]] your voice [[H6963]] like a trumpet. [[H7782]] Declare [[H5046]] to My people [[H5971]] their transgression [[H6588]] and to the house [[H1004]] of Jacob [[H3290]] their sins. [[H2403]]

###### 2
For [[H853]] day [[H3117]] after day [[H3117]] they seek Me [[H1875]] and delight [[H2654]] to know [[H1847]] My ways, [[H1870]] like a nation [[H1471]] that [[H834]] does [[H6213]] what is right [[H6666]] and does not [[H3808]] forsake [[H5800]] the justice [[H4941]] of their God. [[H430]] They ask [[H7592]] Me for righteous [[H6664]] judgments; [[H4941]] they delight [[H2654]] in the nearness [[H7132]] of God. [[H430]]

###### 3
“Why [[H4100]] have we fasted, [[H6684]] and You have not [[H3808]] seen? [[H7200]] [Why] have we humbled [[H6031]] ourselves, [[H5315]] and You have not [[H3808]] noticed?” [[H3045]] “Behold, [[H2005]] on the day [[H3117]] of your fast, [[H6685]] you do [[H4672]] as you please, [[H2656]] and you oppress [[H5065]] all [[H3605]] your workers. [[H6092]]

###### 4
You fast [[H6684]] with contention [[H7379]] and strife [[H4683]] to strike [[H5221]] viciously [[H7562]] with your fist. [[H106]] You cannot [[H3808]] fast [[H6684]] as you do today [[H3117]] and have your voice [[H6963]] be heard [[H8085]] on high. [[H4791]]

###### 5
Is [[H1961]] this [[H2088]] the fast [[H6685]] I have chosen, [[H977]] a day [[H3117]] for a man [[H120]] to deny [[H6031]] himself, [[H5315]] to bow [[H3721]] his head [[H7218]] like a reed, [[H100]] and to spread out [[H3331]] sackcloth [[H8242]] and ashes? [[H665]] Will you call [[H7121]] this [[H2088]] a fast [[H6685]] and a day [[H3117]] acceptable [[H7522]] to the LORD? [[H3068]]

###### 6
Is not [[H3808]] the [[H2088]] fast [[H6685]] I have chosen [[H977]] to break [[H6605]] the chains [[H2784]] of wickedness, [[H7562]] to untie [[H5425]] the cords [[H92]] of the yoke, [[H4133]] to set [[H7971]] the oppressed [[H7533]] free, [[H2670]] and tear off [[H5423]] every [[H3605]] yoke? [[H4133]]

###### 7
Is it not [[H3808]] to share [[H6536]] your bread [[H3899]] with the hungry, [[H7457]] to bring the poor [[H6041]] and homeless [[H4788]] into [[H935]] your home, [[H1004]] to clothe [[H3680]] the naked [[H6174]] when [[H3588]] you see him, [[H7200]] and not [[H3808]] to turn away [[H5956]] from your own flesh and blood? [[H1320]]

###### 8
Then [[H227]] your light [[H216]] will break forth [[H1234]] like the dawn, [[H7837]] and your healing [[H724]] will come [[H6779]] quickly. [[H4120]] Your righteousness [[H6664]] will go [[H1980]] before you, [[H6440]] and the glory [[H3519]] of the LORD [[H3068]] will be your rear guard. [[H622]]

###### 9
Then [[H227]] you will call, [[H7121]] and the LORD [[H3068]] will answer; [[H6030]] you will cry out, [[H7768]] and He will say, [[H559]] ‘Here I am.’ [[H2005]] If [[H518]] you remove [[H5493]] the yoke [[H4133]] from your midst, [[H8432]] the pointing [[H7971]] of the finger [[H676]] and malicious [[H205]] talk, [[H1696]]

###### 10
and if you give [[H6329]] yourself [[H5315]] to the hungry [[H7457]] and satisfy [[H7646]] the afflicted [[H6031]] soul, [[H5315]] then your light [[H216]] will go forth [[H2224]] in the darkness, [[H2822]] and your night [[H653]] will be like noonday. [[H6672]]

###### 11
The LORD [[H3069]] will always [[H8548]] guide you; [[H5148]] He will satisfy [[H7646]] you [[H5315]] in a sun-scorched land [[H6710]] and strengthen [[H2502]] your frame. [[H6106]] You will be [[H1961]] like a well-watered [[H7302]] garden, [[H1588]] like a spring [[H4161]] whose waters [[H4325]] never [[H3808]] fail. [[H3576]]

###### 12
Your people [[H4480]] will rebuild [[H1129]] the ancient [[H5769]] ruins; [[H2723]] you will restore [[H6965]] the age-old [[H1755]] foundations; [[H1755]] you will be called [[H7121]] Repairer [[H1443]] of the Breach, [[H6556]] Restorer [[H7725]] of Streets [[H5410]] of Dwelling. [[H3427]]

###### 13
If [[H518]] you turn [[H7725]] your foot [[H7272]] from [breaking] the Sabbath, [[H7676]] from doing [[H6213]] as you please [[H2656]] on My holy [[H6944]] day, [[H3117]] if you call [[H7121]] the Sabbath [[H7676]] a delight, [[H6027]] and the LORD’s [[H3068]] holy [day] [[H6918]] honorable, [[H3513]] if you honor it [[H3513]] by not going [[H6213]] your own way [[H1870]] or seeking [[H4672]] your own pleasure [[H2656]] or speaking [[H1696]] idle words, [[H1697]]

###### 14
then [[H227]] you will delight [[H6026]] yourself in [[H5921]] the LORD, [[H3068]] and I will make you ride [[H7392]] on [[H5921]] the heights [[H1116]] of the land [[H776]] and feed you [[H398]] with the heritage [[H5159]] of your father [[H1]] Jacob.” [[H3290]] For [[H3588]] the mouth [[H6310]] of the LORD [[H3068]] has spoken. [[H1696]]
