###### 1
On that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] seven [[H7651]] women [[H802]] will take hold [[H2388]] of one [[H259]] man [[H376]] and say, [[H559]] “We will eat [[H398]] our own bread [[H3899]] and provide [[H3847]] our own clothes. [[H8071]] Just [[H7535]] let us be called [[H7121]] by your name. [[H8034]] Take away [[H622]] our disgrace!” [[H2781]]

###### 2
On that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] the Branch [[H6780]] of the LORD [[H3068]] will be [[H1961]] beautiful [[H6643]] and glorious, [[H3519]] and the fruit [[H6529]] of the land [[H776]] will be the pride [[H1347]] and glory [[H8597]] of Israel’s [[H3478]] survivors. [[H6413]]

###### 3
Whoever remains [[H7604]] in Zion [[H6726]] and whoever is left [[H3498]] in Jerusalem [[H3389]] will be called [[H559]] holy— [[H6918]] all [[H3605]] in Jerusalem [[H3389]] who are recorded [[H3789]] among the living— [[H2416]]

###### 4
when [[H518]] the Lord [[H136]] has washed away [[H7364]] the filth [[H6675]] of the daughters [[H1323]] of Zion [[H6726]] and cleansed [[H1740]] the bloodstains [[H1818]] from the heart [[H7130]] of Jerusalem [[H3389]] by a spirit [[H7307]] of judgment [[H4941]] and a spirit [[H7307]] of fire. [[H1197]]

###### 5
Then the LORD [[H3069]] will create [[H1254]] over [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] of Mount [[H2022]] Zion [[H6726]] and over [[H5921]] her assemblies [[H4744]] a cloud [[H6051]] of smoke [[H6227]] by day [[H3119]] and a glowing [[H5051]] flame [[H3852]] of fire [[H784]] by night. [[H3915]] For [[H3588]] over [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] the glory [[H3519]] there will be a canopy, [[H2646]]

###### 6
a shelter [[H5521]] to [give] shade [[H6738]] from the heat [[H2721]] by day, [[H3119]] and a refuge [[H4268]] and hiding place [[H4563]] from the storm [[H2230]] and the rain. [[H4306]]
