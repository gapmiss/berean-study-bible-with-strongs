# Isaiah 31

[[Isaiah 30|←]] • [[Isaiah 32|→]]

### 1
Woe [[H1945]] to those who go down [[H3381]] to Egypt [[H4714]] for help, [[H5833]] who rely [[H8172]] on [[H5921]] horses, [[H5483]] who trust [[H982]] in [[H5921]] their abundance [[H7227]] of chariots [[H7393]] and in [[H5921]] their multitude [[H3966]] of horsemen. [[H6571]] They do not [[H3808]] look [[H8159]] to [[H5921]] the Holy [[H6918]] One of Israel; [[H3478]] they do not [[H3808]] seek [[H1875]] the LORD. [[H3068]]

### 2
Yet [[H1931]] He too [[H1571]] [is] wise [[H2450]] and brings [[H935]] disaster; [[H7451]] He does not [[H3808]] call back [[H5493]] His words. [[H1697]] He will rise up [[H6965]] against [[H5921]] the house [[H1004]] of the wicked [[H7489]] and against [[H5921]] the allies [[H5833]] of evildoers. [[H6466]]

### 3
But the Egyptians [[H4714]] are men, [[H120]] not [[H3808]] God; [[H410]] their horses [[H5483]] are flesh, [[H1320]] not [[H3808]] spirit. [[H7307]] When the LORD [[H3068]] stretches out [[H5186]] His hand, [[H3027]] the helper [[H5826]] will stumble [[H3782]] and the one he helps [[H5826]] will fall; [[H5307]] both [[H3605]] will perish [[H3615]] together. [[H3162]]

### 4
For [[H3588]] this is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] has said [[H559]] to me: [[H413]] “Like [[H834]] a lion [[H738]] roaring [[H1897]] or a young lion [[H3715]] over [[H5921]] its prey— [[H2964]] and though [[H834]] a band [[H4393]] of shepherds [[H7462]] is called out [[H7121]] against it, [[H5921]] it is not [[H3808]] terrified [[H2865]] by their shouting [[H6963]] or subdued [[H6031]] by their clamor— [[H1995]] so [[H3651]] the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts [[H6635]] will come down [[H3381]] to do battle [[H6633]] on [[H5921]] Mount [[H2022]] Zion [[H6726]] [and] [[H5921]] its heights. [[H1389]]

### 5
Like birds [[H6833]] hovering overhead, [[H5774]] so [[H3651]] the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts [[H6635]] will protect [[H1598]] Jerusalem. [[H3389]] He will shield it [[H1598]] and deliver it; [[H5337]] He will pass over it [[H6452]] and preserve it.” [[H4422]]

### 6
Return [[H7725]] to Him [[H834]] against whom you have so blatantly [[H6009]] rebelled, [[H5627]] O children [[H1121]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

### 7
For [[H3588]] on that [[H1931]] day, [[H3117]] every one [[H376]] of you will reject [[H3988]] the idols [[H457]] of silver [[H3701]] and gold [[H2091]] that [[H834]] your own  hands [[H3027]] have sinfully [[H2399]] made. [[H6213]]

### 8
“Then Assyria [[H804]] will fall, [[H5307]] but not [[H3808]] by the sword [[H2719]] of man; [[H376]] a sword [[H2719]] will devour them, [[H398]] but not [[H3808]] one made by mortals. [[H120]] They will flee [[H5127]] before [[H6440]] the sword, [[H2719]] and their young men [[H970]] will be put [[H1961]] to forced labor. [[H4522]]

### 9
Their rock [[H5553]] will pass away [[H5674]] for fear, [[H4032]] and their princes [[H8269]] will panic [[H2865]] at the sight of the battle standard,” [[H5251]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD, [[H3069]] whose [[H834]] fire [[H217]] is in Zion, [[H6726]] whose furnace [[H8574]] is in Jerusalem. [[H3389]]
