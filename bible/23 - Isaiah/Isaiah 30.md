[[Isaiah 29|←]] • [[Isaiah 31|→]]

---

### 1
Woe [[H1945]] to the rebellious [[H5637]] children, [[H1121]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD, [[H3068]] to those who carry out [[H6213]] a plan, [[H6098]] but not [[H3808]] Mine, [[H4480]] who form [[H5258]] an alliance, [[H4541]] but against [[H3808]] My will, [[H7307]] heaping up [[H5595]] sin [[H2403]] upon [[H5921]] sin. [[H2403]]

### 2
They set out [[H1980]] to go down [[H3381]] to Egypt [[H4714]] without [[H3808]] asking [[H7592]] My advice, [[H6310]] to seek shelter [[H5810]] under Pharaoh’s [[H6547]] protection [[H4581]] and take refuge [[H2620]] in the shade [[H6738]] of Egypt. [[H4714]]

### 3
But Pharaoh’s [[H6547]] protection [[H4581]] will become [[H1961]] your shame, [[H1322]] and the refuge [[H2622]] of Egypt’s [[H4714]] shadow [[H6738]] your disgrace. [[H3639]]

### 4
For though [[H3588]] their princes [[H8269]] are [[H1961]] at Zoan [[H6814]] and their envoys [[H4397]] have arrived [[H5060]] in Hanes, [[H2609]]

### 5
everyone [[H3605]] will be put to shame [[H887]] because of [[H5921]] a people [[H5971]] useless [[H3276]] to them.  They cannot [[H3808]] be of help; [[H5828]] they are good [[H3276]] for nothing [[H3808]] but [[H3588]] shame [[H1322]] and reproach. [[H2781]]

### 6
[This is] an oracle [[H4853]] concerning the animals [[H929]] of the Negev: [[H5045]] Through a land [[H776]] of hardship [[H6869]] and distress, [[H6695]] of lioness [[H3833]] and lion, [[H3918]] of viper [[H660]] and flying [[H5774]] serpent, [[H8314]] they carry [[H5375]] their wealth [[H2428]] on [[H5921]] the backs [[H3802]] of donkeys [[H5895]] and their treasures [[H214]] on [[H5921]] the humps [[H1707]] of camels, [[H1581]] to [[H5921]] a people [[H5971]] of no [[H3808]] profit to them. [[H3276]]

### 7
Egypt’s [[H4714]] help [[H5826]] is vain [[H1892]] and empty; [[H7385]] therefore [[H3651]] I have called [[H7121]] her, [[H2063]] ‘Rahab [[H7293]] Who [[H1992]] Just Sits Still.’ [[H7674]]

### 8
Go [[H935]] now, [[H6258]] write [[H3789]] it on [[H5921]] a tablet [[H3871]] in their presence [[H854]] and inscribe [[H2710]] it on [[H5921]] a scroll; [[H5612]] it will be [[H1961]] for the days [[H3117]] to come, [[H314]] a witness [[H5707]] forever [[H5704]] and ever. [[H5769]]

### 9
These [[H1931]] are a rebellious [[H4805]] people, [[H5971]] deceitful [[H3586]] children, [[H1121]] children [[H1121]] unwilling [[H14]] to obey [[H8085]] the LORD’s [[H3068]] instruction. [[H8451]]

### 10
They [[H834]] say [[H559]] to the seers, [[H7200]] “No more [[H3808]] visions,” [[H7200]] and to the prophets, [[H2374]] “Do not [[H3808]] prophesy [[H2372]] to us  the truth. [[H5229]] Speak [[H1696]] to us  pleasant words; [[H2513]] prophesy [[H2372]] illusions. [[H4123]]

### 11
Get out [[H5493]] of [[H4480]] the way; [[H1870]] leave [[H5186]] the pathway. [[H734]] Rid [[H7673]] us of [[H6440]] the Holy [[H6918]] One of Israel.” [[H3478]]

### 12
Therefore [[H3651]] this is what [[H3541]] the Holy [[H6918]] One of Israel [[H3478]] says: [[H559]] “Because [[H3282]] you have rejected [[H3988]] this [[H2088]] message, [[H1697]] trusting [[H982]] in oppression, [[H6233]] and relying [[H8172]] on deceit, [[H3868]]

### 13
this [[H2088]] iniquity [[H5771]] of yours [[H1961]] is like  a breach [[H6556]] about to fall, [[H5307]] a bulge [[H1158]] in a high [[H7682]] wall, [[H2346]] whose collapse [[H7667]] will come [[H935]] suddenly— [[H6597]] in an instant! [[H6621]]

### 14
It will break [[H7665]] in pieces [[H7667]] like a potter’s [[H3335]] jar, [[H5035]] shattered [[H3807]] so that no fragment [[H3808]] can be found. [[H3808]] Not a shard [[H2789]] will be found [[H4672]] in the dust [[H4386]] large enough to scoop [[H2846]] the coals [[H784]] from a hearth [[H3344]] or to skim [[H2834]] the water [[H4325]] from a cistern.” [[H1360]]

### 15
For [[H3588]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD, [[H3069]] the Holy [[H6918]] One of Israel, [[H3478]] has said: [[H559]] “By repentance [[H7729]] and rest [[H5183]] you would be saved; [[H3467]] your strength [[H1369]] would lie [[H1961]] in quiet [[H8252]] confidence— [[H985]] but you were not [[H3808]] willing.” [[H14]]

### 16
“No,” [[H3808]] you say, [[H559]] “we will flee [[H5127]] on [[H5921]] horses.” [[H5483]] Therefore [[H5921]] you will flee! [[H5127]] “We will ride [[H7392]] swift horses,” [[H7031]] but your pursuers [[H7291]] will be faster. [[H7043]]

### 17
A [[H259]] thousand [[H505]] will take flight at [[H6440]] the threat [[H1606]] of one, [[H259]] at [[H6440]] the threat [[H1606]] of five [[H2568]] you will flee, [[H5127]] until [[H5704]] you are left alone [[H3498]] like a lone pole [[H8650]] on [[H5921]] a mountaintop, [[H7218]] like a banner [[H5251]] on [[H5921]] a hill. [[H1389]]

### 18
Therefore [[H3651]] the LORD [[H3068]] longs [[H2442]] to be gracious to you; [[H2603]] therefore [[H3651]] He rises [[H7311]] to show you compassion, [[H7355]] for [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] is a just [[H4941]] God. [[H430]] Blessed are [[H835]] all [[H3605]] who wait [[H2442]] for Him. 

### 19
O people [[H5971]] in Zion, [[H6726]] who dwell [[H3427]] in Jerusalem, [[H3389]] you will weep [[H1058]] no [[H3808]] more. [[H1058]] He will surely [[H2603]] be gracious [[H2603]] at the sound [[H6963]] of your cry; [[H2201]] when He hears, [[H8085]] He will answer you. [[H6030]]

### 20
The Lord [[H136]] will give [[H5414]] you  the bread [[H3899]] of adversity [[H6862]] and the water [[H4325]] of affliction, [[H3906]] but your Teacher [[H3384]] will no longer [[H3808]] hide [[H3670]] Himself— [[H5750]] with your own eyes [[H5869]] you will see [[H7200]] [Him]. [[H3384]]

### 21
And whether [[H3588]] you turn to the right [[H541]] or to the left, [[H8041]] your ears [[H241]] will hear [[H8085]] this command [[H1697]] behind you: [[H310]] “This [[H2088]] is the way. [[H1870]] Walk in it.” [[H1980]]

### 22
So you will desecrate [[H2930]] your silver-plated [[H6826]] idols [[H6456]] and your gold-plated [[H642]] images. [[H4541]] You will throw them away [[H2219]] like [[H3644]] menstrual cloths, [[H1739]] saying, [[H559]] “Be gone!” [[H3318]]

### 23
Then He will send [[H5414]] rain [[H4306]] for the seed [[H2233]] that [[H834]] you have sown [[H2232]] in the ground, [[H127]] and the food [[H3899]] that comes [[H8393]] from your land [[H127]] will be [[H1961]] rich [[H1879]] and plentiful. [[H8082]] On that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] your cattle [[H4735]] will graze [[H7462]] in open [[H7337]] pastures. [[H3733]]

### 24
The oxen [[H504]] and donkeys [[H5895]] that work [[H5647]] the ground [[H127]] will eat [[H398]] salted [[H2548]] fodder [[H1098]] that has been winnowed [[H2219]] with the shovel [[H7371]] and pitchfork. [[H4214]]

### 25
And from [[H5921]] every [[H3605]] high [[H1364]] mountain [[H2022]] and every [[H3605]] raised [[H5375]] hill, [[H1389]] streams [[H6388]] of water [[H4325]] will flow [[H2988]] in the day [[H3117]] of great [[H7227]] slaughter, [[H2027]] when the towers [[H4026]] fall. [[H5307]]

### 26
The light of the moon [[H216]] will be [[H1961]] as bright as the sun, [[H216]] and the light [[H216]] of the sun [[H2535]] will be [[H1961]] seven times brighter— [[H7659]] like the light [[H216]] of seven [[H7651]] days— [[H3117]] on the day [[H3117]] that the LORD [[H3068]] binds up [[H2280]] the brokenness [[H7667]] of His people [[H5971]] and heals [[H7495]] the wounds [[H4273]] He inflicted. [[H4347]]

### 27
Behold, [[H2009]] the Name [[H8034]] of the LORD [[H3068]] comes [[H935]] from afar, [[H4801]] with burning [[H1197]] anger [[H639]] and dense [[H3514]] smoke. [[H4858]] His lips [[H8193]] are full of [[H4390]] fury, [[H2195]] and His tongue [[H3956]] is like a consuming [[H398]] fire. [[H784]]

### 28
His breath [[H7307]] is like a rushing [[H7857]] torrent [[H5158]] that rises [[H2673]] to [[H5704]] the neck. [[H6677]] He comes to sift [[H5130]] the nations [[H1471]] in a sieve [[H5299]] of destruction; [[H7723]] He bridles [[H7448]] the jaws [[H3895]] of the peoples [[H5971]] to lead them astray. [[H8582]]

### 29
You will sing [[H7892]] as on the night [[H3915]] of a holy [[H6942]] festival, [[H2282]] and your heart [[H3824]] will rejoice [[H8057]] like one who walks [[H1980]] to the music of a flute, [[H2485]] going up [[H935]] to the mountain [[H2022]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] to [[H413]] the Rock [[H6697]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

### 30
And the LORD [will cause] [[H3068]] His majestic [[H1935]] voice [[H6963]] to be heard [[H8085]] and His mighty arm [[H2220]] revealed, [[H7200]] striking [[H5183]] in angry [[H639]] wrath, [[H2197]] with a flame [[H3851]] of consuming [[H398]] fire, [[H784]] and with cloudburst, [[H5311]] storm, [[H2230]] and hailstones. [[H68]]

### 31
For [[H3588]] Assyria [[H804]] will be shattered [[H2865]] at the voice [[H6963]] of the LORD. [[H3068]] He will strike [[H5221]] with a rod. [[H7626]]

### 32
And with [[H1961]] every [[H3605]] stroke [[H4569]] of the appointed [[H4145]] staff [[H4294]] that [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] brings down, [[H5117]] the tambourines [[H8596]] and lyres [will sound] [[H3658]] as He battles [[H3898]] with weapons [[H4421]] brandished. [[H8573]]

### 33
For [[H3588]] Topheth [[H8613]] has long [[H865]] been prepared; [[H6186]] it has been made ready [[H3559]] for the king. [[H4428]] Its funeral pyre [[H4071]] is deep [[H6009]] and wide, [[H7337]] with plenty of [[H7235]] fire [[H784]] and wood. [[H6086]] The breath [[H5397]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] like a torrent [[H5158]] of brimstone, [[H1614]] sets it ablaze. [[H1197]]
