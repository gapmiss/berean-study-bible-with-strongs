# Isaiah 40

[[Isaiah 39|←]] • [[Isaiah 41|→]]

---

### 1
“Comfort, [[H5162]] comfort [[H5162]] My people,” [[H5971]] says [[H559]] your God. [[H430]]

### 2
“Speak [[H1696]] tenderly to [[H5921]] Jerusalem, [[H3389]] and proclaim [[H7121]] to her [[H413]] that [[H3588]] her forced labor [[H6635]] has been completed, [[H4390]] her iniquity [[H5771]] has been pardoned; [[H7521]] for [[H3588]] she has received [[H3947]] from the hand [[H3027]] of the LORD [[H3069]] double [[H3718]] for all [[H3605]] her sins.” [[H2403]]

### 3
A voice [[H6963]] of one calling: [[H7121]] “Prepare [[H6437]] the way [[H1870]] for the LORD [[H3068]] in the wilderness; [[H4057]] make a straight [[H3474]] highway [[H4546]] for our God [[H430]] in the desert. [[H6160]]

### 4
Every [[H3605]] valley [[H1516]] shall be lifted up, [[H5375]] and every [[H3605]] mountain [[H2022]] and hill [[H1389]] made low; [[H8213]] the uneven [[H6121]] ground will become [[H1961]] smooth, [[H4334]] and the rugged land [[H7406]] a plain. [[H1237]]

### 5
And the glory [[H3519]] of the LORD [[H3068]] will be revealed, [[H1540]] and all [[H3605]] mankind [[H1320]] together [[H3162]] will see it. [[H7200]] For [[H3588]] the mouth [[H6310]] of the LORD [[H3068]] has spoken.” [[H1696]]

### 6
A voice [[H6963]] says, [[H559]] “Cry out!” [[H7121]] And I asked, [[H559]] “What [[H4100]] should I cry out?” [[H7121]] “All [[H3605]] flesh [[H1320]] is like grass, [[H2682]] and all [[H3605]] its glory [[H2617]] like the flowers [[H6731]] of the field. [[H7704]]

### 7
The grass [[H2682]] withers, [[H3001]] the flowers [[H6731]] fall [[H5034]] when [[H3588]] the breath [[H7307]] of the LORD [[H3068]] blows on them; [[H5380]] indeed, [[H403]] the people [[H5971]] are grass. [[H2682]]

### 8
The grass [[H2682]] withers [[H3001]] [and] the flowers [[H6731]] fall, [[H5034]] but the word [[H1697]] of our God [[H430]] stands [[H6965]] forever.” [[H5769]]

### 9
Go up [[H5927]] on [[H5921]] a high [[H1364]] mountain, [[H2022]] O Zion, [[H6726]] herald of good news. [[H1319]] Raise [[H7311]] your voice loudly, [[H6963]] O Jerusalem, [[H3389]] herald of good news. [[H1319]] Lift [it] up, [[H7311]] do not [[H408]] be afraid! [[H3372]] Say [[H559]] to the cities [[H5892]] of Judah, [[H3063]] “Here [[H2009]] is your God!” [[H430]]

### 10
Behold, [[H2009]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD [[H3069]] comes [[H935]] with might, [[H2389]] and His arm [[H2220]] establishes His rule. [[H4910]] His reward [[H7939]] is with Him, [[H854]] and His recompense [[H6468]] accompanies Him. [[H6440]]

### 11
He tends [[H7462]] His flock [[H5739]] like a shepherd; [[H7462]] He gathers [[H6908]] the lambs [[H2922]] in His arms [[H2220]] and carries them [[H5375]] close to His heart. [[H2436]] He gently leads [[H5095]] the nursing [ewes]. [[H5763]]

### 12
Who [[H4310]] has measured [[H4058]] the waters [[H4325]] in the hollow of his hand, [[H8168]] or marked off [[H8505]] the heavens [[H8064]] with the span of his hand? [[H2239]] Who has held [[H3557]] the dust [[H6083]] of the earth [[H776]] in a basket, [[H7991]] or weighed [[H8254]] the mountains [[H2022]] on a scale [[H6425]] and the hills [[H1389]] with a balance? [[H3976]]

### 13
Who [[H4310]] has directed [[H8505]] the Spirit [[H7307]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] or who has given Him [[H3045]] counsel? [[H6098]]

### 14
Whom [[H4310]] did He consult [[H3289]] to enlighten Him, [[H995]] and who taught Him [[H3925]] the paths [[H734]] of justice? [[H4941]] Who imparted [[H3925]] knowledge to Him [[H1847]] and showed [[H3045]] Him the way [[H1870]] of understanding? [[H8394]]

### 15
Surely [[H2005]] the nations [[H1471]] are like a drop [[H4752]] in a bucket; [[H1805]] they are considered [[H2803]] a speck of dust [[H7834]] on the scales; [[H3976]] He lifts up [[H5190]] the islands [[H339]] like fine dust. [[H1851]]

### 16
Lebanon [[H3844]] [is] not [[H369]] sufficient [[H1767]] for fuel, [[H1197]] nor its animals [[H2416]] enough [[H1767]] for a burnt offering. [[H5930]]

### 17
All [[H3605]] the nations [[H1471]] are as nothing [[H369]] before Him; [[H5048]] He regards them [[H2803]] as nothingness [[H657]] and emptiness. [[H8414]]

### 18
To whom [[H4310]] will you liken [[H1819]] God? [[H410]] To what [[H4100]] image [[H1823]] will you compare Him? [[H6186]]

### 19
To an idol [[H6459]] that a craftsman [[H2796]] casts [[H5258]] and a metalworker [[H6884]] overlays [[H7554]] with gold [[H2091]] and fits with [[H6884]] silver [[H3701]] chains? [[H7577]]

### 20
To one bereft [[H5533]] of an offering [[H8641]] who chooses [[H977]] wood [[H6086]] that does not [[H3808]] rot? [[H7537]] He looks for [[H1245]] a skilled [[H2450]] craftsman [[H2796]] to set up [[H3559]] an idol [[H6459]] that will not [[H3808]] fall over. [[H4131]]

### 21
Do you not [[H3808]] know? [[H3045]] Have you not [[H3808]] heard? [[H8085]] Has it not [[H3808]] been declared to you [[H5046]] from the beginning? [[H7218]] Have you not [[H3808]] understood [[H995]] since the foundation [[H4146]] of the earth? [[H776]]

### 22
He sits enthroned [[H3427]] above [[H5921]] the circle [[H2329]] of the earth; [[H776]] its dwellers [[H3427]] are like grasshoppers. [[H2284]] He stretches out [[H5186]] the heavens [[H8064]] like a curtain, [[H1852]] and spreads them out [[H4969]] like a tent [[H168]] to live in. [[H3427]]

### 23
He brings [[H5414]] the princes [[H7336]] to nothing [[H369]] and makes [[H6213]] the judges [[H8199]] of the earth [[H776]] meaningless. [[H8414]]

### 24
No sooner [[H637]] are they planted, [[H5193]] no sooner [[H637]] are they sown, [[H2232]] no sooner [[H637]] have their stems [[H1503]] taken root [[H8327]] in the ground, [[H776]] than [[H1571]] He blows [[H5398]] on them  and they wither, [[H3001]] and a whirlwind [[H5591]] sweeps them away [[H5375]] like stubble. [[H7179]]

### 25
“To whom [[H4310]] will you compare [[H1819]] Me, [[H413]] or who is My equal?” [[H7737]] asks [[H559]] the Holy One. [[H6918]]

### 26
Lift up [[H5375]] your eyes [[H5869]] on high: [[H4791]] Who [[H4310]] created [[H1254]] all these? [[H428]] He leads forth [[H3318]] the starry host [[H6635]] by number; [[H4557]] He calls [[H7121]] each one [[H3605]] by name. [[H8034]] Because of His great [[H7230]] power [[H202]] and mighty [[H533]] strength, [[H3581]] not [[H3808]] one of them [[H376]] is missing. [[H5737]]

### 27
Why [[H4100]] do you say, [[H559]] O Jacob, [[H3290]] and why do you assert, [[H1696]] O Israel, [[H3478]] “My way [[H1870]] is hidden [[H5641]] from the LORD, [[H3068]] and my claim [[H4941]] is ignored [[H5674]] by my God”? [[H430]]

### 28
Do you not [[H3808]] know? [[H3045]] Have you not [[H3808]] heard? [[H8085]] The LORD [[H3068]] is the everlasting [[H5769]] God, [[H430]] the Creator [[H1254]] of the ends [[H7098]] of the earth. [[H776]] He will never [[H3808]] grow faint [[H3286]] or weary; [[H3021]] His understanding [[H8394]] is beyond [[H369]] searching out. [[H2714]]

### 29
He gives [[H5414]] power [[H3581]] to the faint [[H3287]] and increases [[H7235]] the strength [[H6109]] of the weak. [[H369]]

### 30
Even the youths [[H5288]] may faint [[H3286]] and grow weary, [[H3021]] and young men [[H970]] stumble [[H3782]] and fall. [[H3782]]

### 31
But those who wait [[H6960]] upon the LORD [[H3068]] will renew [[H2498]] their strength; [[H3581]] they will mount up [[H5927]] with wings [[H83]] like eagles; [[H5404]] they will run [[H7323]] and not [[H3808]] grow weary; [[H3021]] they will walk [[H1980]] and not [[H3808]] faint. [[H3286]]
