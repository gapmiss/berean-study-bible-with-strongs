### 1
[This is] an oracle [[H4853]] concerning the Desert [[H4057]] by the Sea: [[H3220]] Like whirlwinds [[H5492]] sweeping [[H2498]] through the Negev, [[H5045]] [an invader] comes [[H935]] from the desert, [[H4057]] from a land [[H776]] of terror. [[H3372]]

### 2
A dire [[H7186]] vision [[H2380]] is declared [[H5046]] to me:  “The traitor [[H898]] still betrays, [[H898]] and the destroyer [[H7703]] still destroys. [[H7703]] Go up, [[H5927]] O Elam! [[H5867]] Lay siege, [[H6696]] O Media! [[H4074]] I will put an end [[H7673]] to all [[H3605]] her groaning.” [[H585]]

### 3
Therefore [[H5921]] my body [[H4975]] is filled [[H4390]] with anguish. [[H2479]] Pain [[H6735]] grips me, [[H270]] like the pains [[H6735]] of a woman in labor. [[H3205]] I am bewildered [[H5753]] to hear, [[H8085]] I am dismayed [[H926]] to see. [[H7200]]

### 4
My heart [[H3824]] staggers; [[H8582]] fear [[H6427]] makes me tremble. [[H1204]] The twilight [[H5399]] of my desire [[H2837]] has turned [[H7760]] to horror. [[H2731]]

### 5
They prepare [[H6186]] a table, [[H7979]] they lay out [[H6823]] a carpet, [[H6823]] they eat, [[H398]] they drink! [[H8354]] Rise up, [[H6965]] O princes, [[H8269]] oil [[H4886]] the shields! [[H4043]]

### 6
For [[H3588]] this [is what] [[H3541]] the Lord [[H136]] says [[H559]] to me: [[H413]] “Go, [[H1980]] post [[H5975]] a lookout [[H6822]] to report [[H5046]] what [[H834]] he sees. [[H7200]]

### 7
When he sees [[H7200]] chariots [[H7393]] with teams [[H6776]] of horsemen, [[H6571]] riders [[H7393]] on donkeys, [[H2543]] riders [[H7393]] on camels, [[H1581]] he must be alert, [[H7181]] fully [[H7227]] alert.” [[H7182]]

### 8
Then the lookout [[H738]] shouted, [[H7121]] “Day [[H8548]] after day, [[H3119]] O lord, [[H136]] I [[H595]] stand [[H5975]] on [[H5921]] the watchtower; [[H4707]] night after [[H3605]] night [[H3915]] I [[H595]] stay [[H5324]] at [[H5921]] my post. [[H4931]]

### 9
Look, [[H2009]] here [[H2088]] come [[H935]] the riders, [[H7393]] horsemen [[H6571]] in pairs.” [[H6776]] And one answered, [[H6030]] saying, [[H559]] “Fallen, [[H5307]] fallen is [[H5307]] Babylon! [[H894]] All [[H3605]] the images [[H6456]] of her gods [[H430]] lie shattered [[H7665]] on the ground.” [[H776]]

### 10
O My people, [[H1121]] crushed [[H4098]] on the threshing floor, [[H1637]] I tell [[H5046]] you  what [[H834]] I have heard [[H8085]] from [[H853]] the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts, [[H6635]] the God [[H430]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

### 11
[This is] an oracle [[H4853]] concerning Dumah: [[H1746]] One calls [[H7121]] to me [[H413]] from Seir, [[H8165]] “Watchman, [[H8104]] what is left [[H4100]] of the night? [[H3915]] Watchman, [[H8104]] what is left [[H4100]] of the night?” [[H3915]]

### 12
The watchman [[H8104]] replies, [[H559]] “Morning [[H1242]] has come, [[H857]] but also [[H1571]] the night. [[H3915]] If [[H518]] you would inquire, [[H1158]] then inquire! [[H1158]] Come back [[H857]] yet again.” [[H7725]]

### 13
[This is] an oracle [[H4853]] concerning Arabia: [[H6152]] In the thickets [[H3293]] of Arabia [[H6152]] you must lodge, [[H3885]] O caravans [[H736]] of Dedanites. [[H1720]]

### 14
Bring [[H857]] water [[H4325]] for the thirsty, [[H6771]] O dwellers [[H3427]] of Tema, [[H8485]] meet [[H6923]] the refugees [[H5074]] with food. [[H3899]]

### 15
For [[H3588]] they flee [[H5074]] from [[H6440]] the sword, [[H2719]] the sword [[H2719]] that is drawn, [[H5203]] from [[H6440]] the bow [[H7198]] that is bent, [[H1869]] and from [[H6440]] the stress [[H3514]] of battle. [[H4421]]

### 16
For [[H3588]] this [is what] [[H3541]] the Lord [[H136]] says [[H559]] to me: [[H413]] “Within one year, [[H8141]] as a hired worker [[H7916]] would count [it], [[H8141]] all [[H3605]] the glory [[H3519]] of Kedar [[H6938]] will be gone. [[H3615]]

### 17
The remaining [[H7605]] archers, [[H7198]] the warriors [[H1368]] of Kedar, [[H6938]] will be few.” [[H4591]] For [[H3588]] the LORD, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] has spoken. [[H1696]]
