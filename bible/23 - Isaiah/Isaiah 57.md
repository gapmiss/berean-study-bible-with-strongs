# Isaiah 57

[[Isaiah 56|←]] • [[Isaiah 58|→]]

---

###### 1
The righteous [[H6662]] perish, [[H6]] and no [[H369]] one [[H376]] takes [[H7760]] it to [[H5921]] heart; [[H3820]] devout [[H2617]] men [[H376]] are swept away, [[H622]] with none [[H369]] considering [[H995]] that [[H3588]] the righteous [[H6662]] are guided [[H622]] from the presence [[H6440]] of evil. [[H7451]]

###### 2
Those who walk [[H1980]] uprightly [[H5228]] enter [[H935]] into peace; [[H7965]] they find rest, [[H5117]] lying down in death. [[H4904]]

###### 3
But come [[H7126]] here, [[H2008]] you [[H859]] sons [[H1121]] of a sorceress, [[H6049]] you offspring [[H2233]] of adulterers [[H5003]] and prostitutes! [[H2181]]

###### 4
Whom [[H4310]] are you mocking? [[H6026]] At [[H5921]] whom [[H4310]] do you snarl [[H7337]] and stick out [[H748]] your tongue? [[H3956]] Are you [[H859]] not [[H3808]] children [[H3206]] of transgression, [[H6588]] offspring [[H2233]] of deceit, [[H8267]]

###### 5
who burn with lust [[H2552]] among the oaks, [[H410]] under [[H8478]] every [[H3605]] luxuriant [[H7488]] tree, [[H6086]] who slaughter [[H7819]] your children [[H3206]] in the valleys, [[H5158]] under [[H8478]] the clefts [[H5585]] of the rocks? [[H5553]]

###### 6
Among the smooth [stones] [[H2511]] of the valley [[H5158]] [is] your portion; [[H2506]] indeed, they [[H1992]] are your lot. [[H1486]] Even [[H1571]] to them you have [[H1992]] poured out [[H8210]] a drink offering, [[H5262]] you have offered [[H5927]] a grain offering. [[H4503]] Should I relent [[H5162]] because of [[H5921]] these? [[H428]]

###### 7
On [[H5921]] a high [[H1364]] and lofty [[H5375]] hill [[H2022]] you have made [[H7760]] your bed, [[H4904]] and [[H1571]] there [[H8033]] you went up [[H5927]] to offer [[H2076]] sacrifices. [[H2077]]

###### 8
Behind [[H310]] the door [[H1817]] and doorpost [[H4201]] you have set up [[H7760]] your memorial. [[H2146]] Forsaking Me, [[H3588]] you uncovered [[H1540]] your bed; [[H4904]] you climbed up [[H5927]] and opened it wide. [[H7337]] And you have made a pact [[H3772]] with those  whose bed [[H4904]] you have loved; [[H157]] you have gazed [[H2372]] upon their nakedness. [[H3027]]

###### 9
You went [[H7788]] to [Molech] [[H4428]] with oil [[H8081]] and multiplied [[H7235]] your perfumes. [[H7547]] You have sent [[H7971]] your envoys [[H6735]] a great distance; [[H7350]] you have descended [[H8213]] even to [[H5704]] Sheol itself. [[H7585]]

###### 10
You are wearied [[H3021]] by your many [[H7230]] journeys, [[H1870]] but you did not [[H3808]] say, [[H559]] “There is no hope!” [[H2976]] You found [[H4672]] renewal [[H2416]] of your strength; [[H3027]] therefore [[H5921]] you did not [[H3808]] grow weak. [[H2470]]

###### 11
Whom [[H4310]] have you dreaded [[H1672]] and feared, [[H3372]] so that [[H3588]] you lied [[H3576]] and [[H853]] failed [[H3808]] to remember Me [[H2142]] or take this [[H7760]] to [[H5921]] heart? [[H3820]] Have I [[H589]] not [[H3808]] held My peace [[H2814]] such a long time, [[H5769]] and still [[H853]] you [[H3808]] do not [[H3808]] fear Me? [[H3372]]

###### 12
I [[H589]] will expose [[H5046]] your righteousness [[H6666]] and your works, [[H4639]] and they will not [[H3808]] profit you. [[H3276]]

###### 13
When you cry out, [[H2199]] let your companies [of idols] [[H6899]] deliver you! [[H5337]] Yet [[H853]] the wind [[H7307]] will carry off [[H5375]] all of them, [[H3605]] a breath [[H1892]] will take them away. [[H3947]] But he who seeks refuge [[H2620]] in Me  will inherit [[H5157]] the land [[H776]] and possess [[H3423]] My holy [[H6944]] mountain.” [[H2022]]

###### 14
And it will be said, [[H559]] “Build it up, [[H5549]] build it up, [[H5549]] prepare [[H6437]] the way, [[H1870]] take [[H7311]] every obstacle [[H4383]] out of the way [[H1870]] of My people.” [[H5971]]

###### 15
For [[H3588]] thus [[H3541]] says [[H559]] the One who is high [[H7311]] and lifted up, [[H5375]] who inhabits [[H7931]] eternity, [[H5703]] whose name [[H8034]] is Holy: [[H6918]] “I dwell [[H7931]] in a high [[H4791]] and holy place, [[H6918]] and with [[H854]] the oppressed [[H1793]] and humble [[H8217]] of spirit, [[H7307]] to restore [[H2421]] the spirit [[H7307]] of the lowly [[H8217]] and revive [[H2421]] the heart [[H3820]] of the contrite. [[H1792]]

###### 16
For [[H3588]] I will not [[H3808]] accuse you forever, [[H7378]] nor will I [[H3808]] always [[H5331]] be angry; [[H7107]] for [[H3588]] then the spirit [of man] [[H7307]] would grow weak [[H5848]] before Me, [[H6440]] with the breath [[H5397]] of those [[H589]] I have made. [[H6213]]

###### 17
I was enraged [[H7107]] by his sinful [[H5771]] greed, [[H1215]] so I struck him [[H5221]] and hid [My face] [[H5641]] in anger; [[H7107]] yet he kept [[H1980]] turning back [[H7726]] to the desires [[H1870]] of his heart. [[H3820]]

###### 18
I have seen [[H7200]] his ways, [[H1870]] but I will heal him; [[H7495]] I will guide him [[H5148]] and restore [[H7999]] comfort [[H5150]] to him  and his mourners, [[H57]]

###### 19
bringing [[H1254]] praise [[H5108]] to their lips. [[H8193]] “Peace, [[H7965]] peace [[H7965]] to those far [[H7350]] and near,” [[H7138]] says [[H559]] the LORD, [[H3068]] “and I will heal them.” [[H7495]]

###### 20
But the wicked [[H7563]] are like the storm-tossed [[H1644]] sea, [[H3220]] for [[H3588]] it cannot [[H3808]] be still, [[H8252]] and its waves [[H4325]] churn up [[H1644]] mire [[H7516]] and muck. [[H2916]]

###### 21
“There is no [[H369]] peace,” [[H7965]] says [[H559]] my God, [[H430]] “for the wicked.” [[H7563]]
