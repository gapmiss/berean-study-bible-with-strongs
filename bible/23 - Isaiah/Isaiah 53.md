# Isaiah 53

[[Isaiah 52|←]] • [[Isaiah 54|→]]

---

###### 1
Who [[H4310]] has believed [[H539]] our message? [[H8052]] And to [[H5921]] whom [[H4310]] has the arm [[H2220]] of the LORD [[H3068]] been revealed? [[H1540]]

###### 2
He grew up [[H5927]] before Him [[H6440]] like a tender shoot, [[H3126]] and like a root [[H8328]] out of dry [[H6723]] ground. [[H776]] He had no [[H3808]] [stately] form [[H8389]] or majesty [[H1926]] to attract us, [[H7200]] no [[H3808]] beauty [[H4758]] that we should desire Him. [[H2530]]

###### 3
He was despised [[H959]] and rejected [[H2310]] by men, [[H376]] a man [[H376]] of sorrows, [[H4341]] acquainted [[H3045]] with grief. [[H2483]] Like one from whom men hide [[H4564]] their faces, [[H6440]] He was despised, [[H959]] and we esteemed [[H2803]] Him not. [[H3808]]

###### 4
Surely [[H403]] He [[H1931]] took on [[H5375]] our infirmities [[H2483]] and carried [[H5445]] our sorrows; [[H4341]] yet we [[H587]] considered Him [[H2803]] stricken [[H5060]] by God, [[H430]] struck down [[H5221]] and afflicted. [[H6031]]

###### 5
But He [[H1931]] was pierced [[H2490]] for our transgressions, [[H6588]] He was crushed [[H1792]] for our iniquities; [[H5771]] the punishment [[H4148]] that brought us peace [[H7965]] was upon Him, [[H5921]] and by His stripes [[H2250]] we are healed. [[H7495]]

###### 6
We all [[H3605]] like sheep [[H6629]] have gone astray, [[H8582]] each one [[H376]] has turned [[H6437]] to his own way; [[H1870]] and the LORD [[H3068]] has laid [[H6293]] on Him [[H853]] the iniquity [[H5771]] of us all. [[H3605]]

###### 7
He was oppressed [[H5065]] and afflicted, [[H6031]] yet He did not [[H3808]] open [[H6605]] His mouth. [[H6310]] He was led [[H2986]] like a lamb [[H7716]] to the slaughter, [[H2874]] and as a sheep [[H7353]] before [[H6440]] her shearers [[H1494]] is silent, [[H481]] so He did not [[H3808]] open [[H6605]] His mouth. [[H6310]]

###### 8
By oppression [[H6115]] and judgment [[H4941]] He was taken away, [[H3947]] and who [[H4310]] can recount [[H7878]] His descendants? [[H1755]] For [[H3588]] He was cut off [[H1504]] from the land [[H776]] of the living; [[H2416]] He was stricken [[H5061]] for the transgression [[H6588]] of My people. [[H5971]]

###### 9
He was assigned [[H5414]] a grave [[H6913]] with [[H854]] the wicked, [[H7563]] and with [[H854]] a rich man [[H6223]] in His death, [[H4194]] although [[H5921]] He had done [[H6213]] no [[H3808]] violence, [[H2555]] nor [[H3808]] was any deceit [[H4820]] in His mouth. [[H6310]]

###### 10
Yet it was the LORD’s [[H3068]] will [[H2654]] to crush Him [[H1792]] and cause Him to suffer. [[H2470]] And when [[H518]] His soul [[H5315]] is made [[H7760]] a guilt offering, [[H817]] He will see [[H7200]] [His] offspring, [[H2233]] He will prolong [[H748]] His days, [[H3117]] and the good pleasure [[H2656]] of the LORD [[H3068]] will prosper [[H6743]] in His hand. [[H3027]]

###### 11
After the anguish [[H5999]] of His soul, [[H5315]] He will see the light of life [[H7200]] and be satisfied. [[H7646]] By His knowledge [[H1847]] My righteous [[H6662]] Servant [[H5650]] will justify [[H6663]] many, [[H7227]] and He [[H1931]] will bear [[H5445]] their iniquities. [[H5771]]

###### 12
Therefore [[H3651]] I will allot Him a portion [[H2505]] with the great, [[H7227]] and He will divide [[H2505]] the spoils [[H7998]] with the strong, [[H6099]] because [[H8478]] He has poured out [[H6168]] His life [[H5315]] unto death, [[H4194]] and [[H854]] He was numbered [[H4487]] among [[H854]] the transgressors. [[H6586]] Yet He [[H1931]] bore [[H5375]] the sin [[H2399]] of many [[H7227]] and made intercession [[H6293]] for the transgressors. [[H6586]]
