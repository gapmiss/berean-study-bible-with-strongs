### 1
In the year [[H8141]] that King [[H4428]] Uzziah [[H5818]] died, [[H4194]] I saw [[H7200]] the Lord [[H136]] seated [[H3427]] on [[H5921]] a throne, [[H3678]] high [[H7311]] and exalted; [[H5375]] and the train of His robe [[H7757]] filled [[H4390]] the temple. [[H1964]]

### 2
Above [[H4605]] Him  stood [[H5975]] seraphim, [[H8314]] each [[H259]] having six [[H8337]] wings: [[H3671]] With two [wings] [[H8147]] they covered [[H3680]] their faces, [[H6440]] with two [[H8147]] they covered [[H3680]] their feet, [[H7272]] and with two [[H8147]] they were flying. [[H5774]]

### 3
And they [[H2088]] called out [[H7121]] to [[H413]] one another: [[H2088]] Holy, [[H6918]] holy, [[H6918]] holy [[H6918]] is the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts; [[H6635]] His glory [[H3519]] fills [[H4393]] all [[H3605]] the earth. [[H776]]

### 4
The doorposts [[H520]] and thresholds [[H5592]] shook [[H5128]] at the sound [[H6963]] of their voices, [[H7121]] and the temple [[H1004]] was filled [[H4390]] with smoke. [[H6227]]

### 5
Then I said, [[H559]] “Woe [[H188]] is me,  for [[H3588]] I am ruined, [[H1820]] because [[H3588]] I [[H595]] am a man [[H376]] of unclean [[H2931]] lips [[H8193]] dwelling [[H3427]] among [[H8432]] a people [[H5971]] of unclean [[H2931]] lips, [[H8193]] [and] [[H3588]] my eyes [[H5869]] have seen [[H7200]] the King, [[H4428]] the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts.” [[H6635]]

### 6
Then one [[H259]] of [[H4480]] the seraphim [[H8314]] flew [[H5774]] to me, [[H413]] and in his hand [[H3027]] was a glowing coal [[H7531]] that he had taken [[H3947]] with tongs [[H4457]] from [[H5921]] the altar. [[H4196]]

### 7
And with it he touched [[H5060]] my mouth [[H6310]] and said, [[H559]] “Now that [[H2009]] this [[H2088]] has touched [[H5060]] your lips, [[H8193]] your iniquity [[H5771]] is removed [[H5493]] and your sin [[H2403]] is atoned for.” [[H3722]]

### 8
Then I heard [[H8085]] the voice [[H6963]] of the Lord [[H136]] saying, [[H559]] “Whom [[H4310]] shall I send? [[H7971]] Who [[H4310]] will go for Us?” [[H1980]] And I said, [[H559]] “Here am I. [[H2005]] Send me!” [[H7971]]

### 9
And He replied, [[H559]] “Go [[H1980]] and tell [[H559]] this [[H2088]] people: [[H5971]] ‘Be ever hearing, [[H8085]] but never [[H408]] understanding; [[H995]] be ever seeing, [[H7200]] but never [[H408]] perceiving.’ [[H3045]]

### 10
{Make} the hearts [[H3820]] of this [[H2088]] people [[H5971]] calloused; [[H8080]] deafen [[H3513]] their ears [[H241]] and close [[H8173]] their eyes. [[H5869]] Otherwise [[H6435]] they might see [[H7200]] with their eyes, [[H5869]] hear [[H8085]] with their ears, [[H241]] understand [[H995]] with their hearts, [[H3824]] and turn [[H7725]] and be healed. [[H7495]]

### 11
Then I asked, [[H559]] “How long, [[H5704]] O Lord?” [[H136]] And He replied, [[H559]] “Until [[H5704]] cities [[H5892]] lie in ruins [[H7582]] without [[H369]] an inhabitant, [[H3427]] until the houses [[H1004]] are left unoccupied, [[H369]] and the land [[H127]] is desolate [[H7582]] and ravaged, [[H8077]]

### 12
until the LORD [[H3069]] has driven men [[H120]] far away, [[H7368]] and the land [[H776]] is utterly [[H7227]] forsaken. [[H5805]]

### 13
And though [[H5750]] a tenth [remains] [[H6224]] in [the land],  it will be [[H1961]] burned [[H1197]] again. [[H7725]] As the terebinth [[H424]] and oak [[H437]] leave stumps [[H4678]] when felled, [[H7995]] so the holy [[H6944]] seed [[H2233]] will be a stump [[H4678]] in [the land].”
