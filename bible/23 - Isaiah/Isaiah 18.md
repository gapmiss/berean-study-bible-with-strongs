### 1
Woe [[H1945]] to the land [[H776]] of whirring [[H6767]] wings, [[H3671]] along [[H5676]] the rivers [[H5104]] of Cush, [[H3568]]

### 2
which sends [[H7971]] couriers [[H6735]] by sea, [[H3220]] in papyrus [[H1573]] vessels [[H3627]] on [[H5921]] the waters. [[H4325]] Go, [[H1980]] swift [[H7031]] messengers, [[H4397]] to [[H413]] a people [[H1471]] tall [[H4900]] and smooth-skinned, [[H4178]] to [[H413]] a people [[H5971]] widely [[H4480]] feared, [[H3372]] to a powerful [[H6978]] nation [[H1471]] of strange speech, [[H4001]] whose land [[H776]] is divided [[H958]] by rivers. [[H5104]]

### 3
All [[H3605]] you people [[H3427]] of the world [[H8398]] and dwellers [[H7931]] of the earth, [[H776]] when a banner [[H5251]] is raised [[H5375]] on the mountains, [[H2022]] you will see it; [[H7200]] when a trumpet [[H7782]] sounds, [[H8628]] you will hear it. [[H8085]]

### 4
For [[H3588]] this is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] has told [[H559]] me: [[H413]] “I will quietly [[H8252]] look on [[H5027]] from My dwelling place, [[H4349]] like shimmering [[H6703]] heat [[H2527]] in [[H5921]] the sunshine, [[H219]] like a cloud [[H5645]] of dew [[H2919]] in the heat [[H2527]] of harvest.” [[H7105]]

### 5
For [[H3588]] before [[H6440]] the harvest, [[H7105]] when the blossom [[H6525]] is gone [[H8552]] and the flower [[H5328]] becomes [[H1961]] a ripening [[H1580]] grape, [[H1155]] He will cut off [[H3772]] the shoots [[H2150]] with a pruning knife, [[H4211]] and [[H853]] remove [[H8456]] and discard [[H5493]] the branches. [[H5189]]

### 6
They will all [[H3162]] be left [[H5800]] to the mountain [[H2022]] birds of prey, [[H5861]] and to the beasts [[H929]] of the land. [[H776]] The birds [[H5861]] will feed on them in summer, [[H6972]] and all [[H3605]] the wild animals [[H929]] in winter. [[H2778]]

### 7
At that [[H1931]] time [[H6256]] gifts [[H7862]] will be brought [[H2986]] to the LORD [[H3069]] of Hosts— [[H6635]] from a people [[H5971]] tall [[H4900]] and smooth-skinned, [[H4178]] from a people [[H5971]] widely [[H4480]] feared, [[H3372]] from a powerful [[H6978]] nation [[H1471]] of strange speech, [[H4001]] whose [[H834]] land [[H776]] is divided [[H958]] by rivers— [[H5104]] to [[H413]] Mount [[H2022]] Zion, [[H6726]] the place [[H4725]] of the Name [[H8034]] of the LORD [[H3069]] of Hosts.
