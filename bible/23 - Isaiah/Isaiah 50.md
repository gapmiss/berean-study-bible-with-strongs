# Isaiah 50

[[Isaiah 49|←]] • [[Isaiah 51|→]]

###### 1
This is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] says: [[H559]] “Where [[H335]] is your mother’s [[H517]] certificate [[H5612]] of divorce [[H3748]] with which [[H834]] I sent her away? [[H7971]] Or [[H176]] to which [[H4310]] of My creditors [[H5383]] did I sell you? [[H4376]] Look, [[H2005]] you were sold [[H4376]] for your iniquities, [[H5771]] and for your transgressions [[H6588]] your mother [[H517]] was sent away. [[H7971]]

###### 2
Why [[H4069]] was no [[H369]] one there [[H376]] when I arrived? [[H935]] Why did no one [[H369]] answer [[H6030]] when I called? [[H7121]] Is My hand [[H3027]] too short [[H7114]] to redeem you? [[H6304]] Or [[H518]] do I lack [[H369]] the strength [[H3581]] to deliver you? [[H5337]] Behold, [[H2005]] My rebuke [[H1606]] dries up [[H2717]] the sea; [[H3220]] I turn the rivers [[H5104]] into [[H7760]] a desert; [[H4057]] the fish [[H1710]] rot [[H887]] for lack [[H369]] of water [[H4325]] and they die [[H4191]] of thirst. [[H6772]]

###### 3
I clothe [[H3847]] the heavens [[H8064]] in black [[H6940]] and make [[H7760]] sackcloth [[H8242]] their covering. [[H3682]]

###### 4
The Lord [[H136]] GOD [[H3069]] has given Me [[H5414]] the tongue [[H3956]] of discipleship, [[H3928]] to sustain [[H5790]] the weary [[H3287]] with a word. [[H1697]] He awakens Me [[H5782]] morning [[H1242]] by morning; [[H1242]] He awakens [[H5782]] My ear [[H241]] to listen [[H8085]] as a disciple. [[H3928]]

###### 5
The Lord [[H136]] GOD [[H3068]] has opened [[H6605]] My ears, [[H241]] and I [[H595]] have not been [[H3808]] rebellious, [[H4784]] nor have I [[H3808]] turned [[H5472]] back. [[H268]]

###### 6
I offered [[H5414]] My back [[H1460]] to those who struck Me, [[H5221]] and My cheeks [[H3895]] to those who tore out My beard. [[H4803]] I did not [[H3808]] hide [[H5641]] My face [[H6440]] from scorn [[H3639]] and spittle. [[H7536]]

###### 7
Because the Lord [[H136]] GOD [[H3069]] helps [[H5826]] Me,  I have not [[H3808]] been disgraced; [[H3637]] therefore [[H5921]] I have set [[H7760]] My face [[H6440]] like flint, [[H2496]] and I know [[H3045]] I will not [[H3808]] be put to shame. [[H954]]

###### 8
The One who vindicates [[H6663]] Me is near. [[H7138]] Who [[H4310]] will dare to contend [[H7378]] with Me? [[H854]] Let us confront [[H5975]] each other! [[H3162]] Who [[H4310]] has a case against Me? [[H4941]] Let him approach [[H5066]] Me! [[H413]]

###### 9
Surely [[H2005]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD [[H3069]] helps [[H5826]] Me.  Who [[H4310]] is there [[H1931]] to condemn Me? [[H7561]] See, [[H2005]] they will all [[H3605]] wear out [[H1086]] like a garment; [[H899]] the moths [[H6211]] will devour them. [[H398]]

###### 10
Who [[H4310]] among you  fears [[H3373]] the LORD [[H3068]] [and] obeys [[H8085]] the voice [[H6963]] of His Servant? [[H5650]] Who [[H834]] among you walks [[H1980]] in darkness [[H2825]] and has no [[H369]] light? [[H5051]] Let him trust [[H982]] in the name [[H8034]] of the LORD; [[H3068]] let him lean [[H8172]] on his God. [[H430]]

###### 11
Behold, [[H2005]] all [[H3605]] you who kindle [[H6919]] a fire, [[H784]] who array yourselves [[H247]] with firebrands, [[H2131]] walk [[H1980]] in the light [[H217]] of your fire [[H784]] and in the firebrands [[H2131]] you have lit! [[H1197]] This [[H2063]] is what you will receive [[H1961]] from My hand: [[H3027]] You will lie down [[H7901]] in a place of torment. [[H4620]]
