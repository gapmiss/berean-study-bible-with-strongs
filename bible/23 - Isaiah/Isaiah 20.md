# Isaiah 20

[[Isaiah 19|←]] • [[Isaiah 21|→]]

---

### 1
Before the year [[H8141]] that the chief commander, [[H8661]] sent [[H7971]] by Sargon [[H5623]] king [[H4428]] of Assyria, [[H804]] came [[H935]] to Ashdod [[H795]] and attacked [[H3898]] and captured it, [[H3920]]

### 2
the LORD [[H3069]] had already spoken [[H1696]] through [[H3027]] Isaiah [[H3470]] son [[H1121]] of Amoz, [[H531]] saying, [[H559]] “Go, [[H1980]] remove [[H6605]] the sackcloth [[H8242]] from [[H5921]] your waist [[H4975]] [and] [[H2502]] the sandals [[H5275]] from your feet.” [[H7272]] And [Isaiah] did [[H6213]] so, [[H3651]] walking around [[H1980]] naked [[H6174]] and barefoot. [[H3182]]

### 3
Then the LORD [[H3068]] said, [[H559]] “Just as [[H834]] My servant [[H5650]] Isaiah [[H3470]] has gone [[H1980]] naked [[H6174]] and barefoot [[H3182]] for three [[H7969]] years, [[H8141]] as a sign [[H226]] and omen [[H4159]] against [[H5921]] Egypt [[H4714]] and Cush, [[H3568]]

### 4
so [[H3651]] the king [[H4428]] of Assyria [[H804]] will lead away [[H5090]] the captives [[H7628]] of Egypt [[H4714]] and the exiles [[H1546]] of Cush, [[H3568]] young [[H5288]] and old alike, [[H2205]] naked [[H6174]] and barefoot, [[H3182]] with bared [[H2834]] buttocks— [[H8357]] to Egypt’s [[H4714]] shame. [[H6172]]

### 5
Those who made Cush [[H3568]] their hope [[H4007]] and Egypt [[H4714]] their boast [[H8597]] will be dismayed [[H2865]] and ashamed. [[H954]]

### 6
And on that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] the dwellers [[H3427]] of this [[H2088]] coastland [[H339]] will say, [[H559]] ‘See [[H2009]] what has happened [[H3541]] to our source of hope, [[H4007]] those to whom [[H834]] we fled [[H5127]] for help [[H5833]] and deliverance [[H5337]] from [[H6440]] the king [[H4428]] of Assyria! [[H804]] How then [[H349]] can we [[H587]] escape?’” [[H4422]]
