# Isaiah 29

[[Isaiah 28|←]] • [[Isaiah 30|→]]

---

### 1
Woe to you, [[H1945]] O Ariel, [[H740]] Ariel, [[H740]] the city [[H7151]] where David [[H1732]] camped! [[H2583]] Year [[H8141]] upon [[H5921]] year [[H8141]] let your festivals [[H2282]] recur. [[H5362]]

### 2
And I will constrain [[H6693]] Ariel, [[H740]] and there will be [[H1961]] mourning [[H8386]] and sorrow; [[H592]] she will be [[H1961]] like an altar hearth [[H740]] before me. 

### 3
I will camp [[H2583]] in a circle [[H1754]] around you; [[H5921]] I will besiege you [[H6696]] with towers [[H4674]] and set up [[H6965]] siege works [[H4694]] against you. [[H5921]]

### 4
You will be brought low, [[H8213]] you will speak [[H1696]] from the ground, [[H776]] and out of the dust [[H6083]] your words [[H565]] will be muffled. [[H7817]] Your voice [[H6963]] will be [[H1961]] like a spirit [[H178]] from the ground; [[H776]] your speech [[H565]] will whisper [[H6850]] out of the dust. [[H6083]]

### 5
But your many [[H1995]] foes [[H2114]] will be [[H1961]] like fine [[H1851]] dust, [[H80]] the multitude [[H1995]] of the ruthless [[H6184]] like blowing [[H5674]] chaff. [[H4671]] Then suddenly, [[H6597]] in an instant, [[H6621]]

### 6
you will be visited [[H6485]] by [[H5973]] the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts [[H6635]] with thunder [[H7482]] and earthquake [[H7494]] and loud [[H1419]] noise, [[H6963]] with windstorm [[H5492]] and tempest [[H5591]] and flame [[H3851]] of consuming [[H398]] fire. [[H784]]

### 7
All [[H3605]] the many [[H1995]] nations [[H1471]] going out to battle [[H6633]] against [[H5921]] Ariel— [[H740]] even all [[H3605]] who war against her, [[H6633]] laying siege [[H4685]] and attacking her— [[H6693]] will be [[H1961]] like a dream, [[H2472]] like a vision [[H2377]] in the night, [[H3915]]

### 8
as when [[H834]] a hungry man [[H7457]] dreams [[H2492]] he is eating, [[H398]] then wakes [[H6974]] and is still hungry. [[H7386]] And like [[H834]] a thirsty man [[H6771]] dreams [[H2492]] he is drinking, [[H8354]] then awakens [[H6974]] faint [[H5889]] and parched, [[H8264]] so [[H3651]] it will be [[H1961]] for all [[H3605]] the many [[H1995]] nations [[H1471]] who go to battle [[H6633]] against [[H5921]] Mount [[H2022]] Zion. [[H6726]]

### 9
Stop [[H4102]] and be astonished; [[H8539]] blind yourselves [[H8173]] and be sightless; [[H8173]] be drunk, [[H7937]] but not [[H3808]] with wine; [[H3196]] stagger, [[H5128]] but not [[H3808]] from strong drink. [[H7941]]

### 10
For [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3069]] has poured out [[H5258]] on you [[H5921]] a spirit [[H7307]] of deep sleep; [[H8639]] He has shut [[H6105]] your eyes, [[H5869]] O prophets, [[H5030]] and covered [[H3680]] your heads, [[H7218]] O seers. [[H2374]]

### 11
And the entire [[H3605]] vision [[H2380]] will be [[H1961]] to you  like the words [[H1697]] sealed [[H2856]] in a scroll. [[H5612]] If it [[H834]] is handed [[H5414]] to [[H413]] a reader, [[H3045]] he will say, [[H559]] “I cannot [read it], [[H3808]] because [[H3588]] it [[H1931]] is sealed.” [[H2856]]

### 12
Or if the scroll [[H5612]] is given [[H5414]] to [[H5921]] one who [[H834]] is not [[H3808]] able to read, [[H3045]] he will say, [[H559]] “I cannot read.” [[H3808]]

### 13
Therefore [[H3282]] the Lord [[H136]] said: [[H559]] “These [[H2088]] people [[H5971]] draw near to Me [[H5066]] with their mouths [[H6310]] and honor Me [[H3513]] with their lips, [[H8193]] but their hearts [[H3820]] are far [[H7368]] from Me. [[H4480]] Their worship [[H3373]] of Me [[H853]] is but [[H1961]] rules [[H4687]] taught [[H3925]] by men. [[H376]]

### 14
Therefore [[H3651]] I will again [[H3254]] confound [[H6381]] these [[H2088]] people [[H5971]] with wonder [[H6381]] upon wonder. [[H6382]] The wisdom [[H2451]] of the wise [[H2450]] will perish, [[H6]] and the intelligence [[H998]] of the intelligent [[H995]] will be hidden. [[H5641]]

### 15
Woe [[H1945]] to those who dig deep [[H6009]] to hide [[H5641]] their plans [[H6098]] from the LORD. [[H3068]] In darkness [[H4285]] they do their works [[H4639]] and say, [[H559]] “Who [[H4310]] sees us, [[H7200]] and who [[H4310]] will know?” [[H3045]]

### 16
You have turned things upside down, [[H2017]] as if [[H518]] the potter [[H3335]] were regarded [[H2803]] as clay. [[H2563]] Shall [[H3588]] what is formed [[H4639]] say [[H559]] to him who formed it, [[H6213]] “He did not [[H3808]] make me”? [[H6213]] Can the pottery [[H3336]] say [[H559]] of the potter, [[H3335]] “He has no [[H3808]] understanding”? [[H995]]

### 17
In just [[H3808]] a very [[H5750]] short [[H4592]] time, [[H4213]] [will not] Lebanon [[H3844]] become [[H7725]] an orchard, [[H3759]] and the orchard [[H3759]] seem [[H2803]] like a forest? [[H3293]]

### 18
On that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] the deaf [[H2795]] will hear [[H8085]] the words [[H1697]] of the scroll, [[H5612]] and out of [[H652]] the deep darkness [[H2822]] the eyes [[H5869]] of the blind [[H5787]] will see. [[H7200]]

### 19
The humble [[H6035]] will increase [[H3254]] [their] joy [[H8057]] in the LORD, [[H3068]] and the poor [[H34]] among men [[H120]] will rejoice [[H1523]] in the Holy One [[H6918]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

### 20
For [[H3588]] the ruthless [[H6184]] will vanish, [[H656]] the mockers [[H3887]] will disappear, [[H3615]] and all [[H3605]] who look [[H8245]] for evil [[H205]] will be cut down— [[H3772]]

### 21
those who indict [[H2398]] a man [[H120]] with a word, [[H1697]] who ensnare [[H6983]] the mediator [[H3198]] at the gate, [[H8179]] and with empty charges [[H8414]] deprive the righteous [[H6662]] of justice. [[H5186]]

### 22
Therefore, [[H3651]] the LORD [[H3068]] who [[H834]] redeemed [[H6299]] Abraham [[H85]] says [[H559]] of [[H413]] the house [[H1004]] of Jacob: [[H3290]] “No [[H3808]] longer [[H6258]] will Jacob [[H3290]] be ashamed [[H954]] and no [[H3808]] more [[H6258]] will his face [[H6440]] grow pale. [[H2357]]

### 23
For [[H3588]] when he sees [[H7200]] his children, [[H3206]] the work [[H4639]] of My hands [[H3027]] among him, [[H7130]] they will honor [[H6942]] My name, [[H8034]] they will sanctify [[H6942]] the Holy [[H6918]] One of Jacob, [[H3290]] and [[H853]] they will stand in awe [[H6206]] of the God [[H430]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

### 24
Then the wayward [[H8582]] in spirit [[H7307]] will come [[H3045]] to understanding, [[H998]] and those who grumble [[H7279]] will accept [[H3925]] instruction.” [[H3948]]
