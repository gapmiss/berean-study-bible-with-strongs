# Isaiah 62

[[Isaiah 61|←]] • [[Isaiah 63|→]]

---

### 1
For Zion’s [[H6726]] sake [[H4616]] I will not [[H3808]] keep silent, [[H2814]] and for Jerusalem’s [[H3389]] sake [[H4616]] I will not [[H3808]] keep still, [[H8252]] until [[H5704]] her righteousness [[H6664]] shines [[H3318]] like a bright light, [[H5051]] her salvation [[H3444]] like a blazing [[H1197]] torch. [[H3940]]

### 2
Nations [[H1471]] will see [[H7200]] your righteousness, [[H6664]] and all [[H3605]] kings [[H4428]] your glory. [[H3519]] You will be called [[H7121]] by  a new [[H2319]] name [[H8034]] that [[H834]] the mouth [[H6310]] of the LORD [[H3068]] will bestow. [[H5344]]

### 3
You will be [[H1961]] a crown [[H5850]] of glory [[H8597]] in the hand [[H3027]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] a royal [[H4410]] diadem [[H6797]] in the palm [[H3709]] of your God. [[H430]]

### 4
No [[H3808]] longer [[H5750]] will you be called [[H559]] Forsaken, [[H5805]] nor your land [[H776]] named [[H559]] Desolate; [[H8077]] but [[H3588]] you will be called [[H7121]] Hephzibah, [[H2657]] and your land [[H776]] Beulah; [[H1166]] for [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] will take delight [[H2654]] in you,  and your land [[H776]] will be His bride. [[H1166]]

### 5
For [[H3588]] as a young man [[H970]] marries [[H1166]] a young woman, [[H1330]] so your sons [[H1121]] will marry you; [[H1166]] and as a groom [[H2860]] rejoices [[H4885]] over [[H5921]] his bride, [[H3618]] so your God [[H430]] will rejoice [[H7797]] over you. [[H5921]]

### 6
On [[H5921]] your walls, [[H2346]] O Jerusalem, [[H3389]] I have posted [[H6485]] watchmen; [[H8104]] they will never [[H8548]] be silent [[H2814]] day [[H3605]] or night. [[H3605]] You who call [[H2142]] on the LORD [[H3068]] shall take no [[H408]] rest [[H1824]] for yourselves, 

### 7
nor [[H408]] give Him [[H5414]] any rest [[H1824]] until [[H5704]] He establishes [[H3559]] Jerusalem [[H3389]] and makes her [[H7760]] the praise [[H8416]] of the earth. [[H776]]

### 8
The LORD [[H3068]] has sworn [[H7650]] by His right hand [[H3225]] and by His mighty [[H5797]] arm: [[H2220]] “Never [[H518]] again [[H5750]] will I give [[H5414]] your grain [[H1715]] to your enemies [[H341]] for food, [[H3978]] nor will [[H518]] foreigners [[H1121]] drink [[H8354]] the new wine [[H8492]] for which [[H834]] you have toiled. [[H3021]]

### 9
For [[H3588]] those who harvest [grain] [[H622]] will eat it [[H398]] and praise [[H1984]] the LORD, [[H3068]] and those who gather [grapes] [[H6908]] will drink the wine [[H8354]] in My holy [[H6944]] courts.” [[H2691]]

### 10
Go out, [[H5674]] go out [[H5674]] through the gates; [[H8179]] prepare [[H6437]] the way [[H1870]] for the people! [[H5971]] Build it up, [[H5549]] build up [[H5549]] the highway; [[H4546]] clear away [[H5619]] the stones! [[H68]] Raise [[H7311]] a banner [[H5251]] for [[H5921]] the nations [to see]. [[H5971]]

### 11
Behold, [[H2009]] the LORD [[H3068]] has proclaimed [[H8085]] to [[H413]] the ends [[H7097]] of the earth, [[H776]] “Say [[H559]] to Daughter [[H1323]] Zion: [[H6726]] See, [[H2009]] your Savior [[H3468]] comes! [[H935]] Look, [[H2009]] His reward [[H7939]] is with Him, [[H854]] and His recompense [[H6468]] goes before Him.” [[H6440]]

### 12
And they will be called [[H7121]] the Holy [[H6944]] People, [[H5971]] the Redeemed [[H1350]] of The LORD; [[H3069]] and you will be called [[H7121]] Sought Out, [[H1875]] A City [[H5892]] Not [[H3808]] Forsaken. [[H5800]]
