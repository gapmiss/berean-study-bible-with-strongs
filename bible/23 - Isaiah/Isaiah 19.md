[[Isaiah 18|←]] • [[Isaiah 20|→]]

---

### 1
[This is] an oracle [[H4853]] concerning Egypt: [[H4714]] Behold, [[H2009]] the LORD [[H3068]] rides [[H7392]] on [[H5921]] a swift [[H7031]] cloud; [[H5645]] He is coming [[H935]] to Egypt. [[H4714]] The idols [[H457]] of Egypt [[H4714]] will tremble [[H5128]] before Him, [[H6440]] and the hearts [[H3824]] of the Egyptians [[H4714]] will melt [[H4549]] within them. [[H7130]]

### 2
“So I will incite [[H5526]] Egyptian [[H4714]] against Egyptian; [[H4714]] [brother] [[H376]] will fight [[H3898]] against brother, [[H251]] [neighbor] [[H376]] against neighbor, [[H7453]] city [[H5892]] against city, [[H5892]] [and] kingdom [[H4467]] against kingdom. [[H4467]]

### 3
Then the spirit [[H7307]] of the Egyptians [[H4714]] will be emptied out [[H1238]] from among them, [[H7130]] and I will frustrate [[H1104]] their plans, [[H6098]] so that they will resort [[H1875]] to [[H413]] idols [[H457]] and [[H413]] spirits of the dead, [[H328]] to mediums [[H178]] and [[H413]] spiritists. [[H3049]]

### 4
I will deliver [[H5534]] the Egyptians [[H4714]] into the hands [[H3027]] of harsh [[H7186]] masters, [[H113]] and a fierce [[H5794]] king [[H4428]] will rule [[H4910]] over them,”  declares [[H5002]] the Lord [[H113]] GOD [[H3068]] of Hosts. [[H6635]]

### 5
The waters [[H4325]] of the [Nile] [[H3220]] will dry up, [[H5405]] and the riverbed [[H5104]] will be parched [[H2717]] and empty. [[H3001]]

### 6
The canals [[H5104]] will stink; [[H2186]] the streams [[H2975]] of Egypt [[H4693]] will trickle [[H1809]] and dry up; [[H2717]] the reeds [[H7070]] and rushes [[H5488]] will wither. [[H7060]]

### 7
The bulrushes [[H6169]] by [[H5921]] the Nile, [[H2975]] by [[H5921]] the mouth [[H6310]] of the river, [[H2975]] and all [[H3605]] the fields sown [[H4218]] along the Nile, [[H2975]] will wither, [[H3001]] blow away, [[H5086]] and be no [more]. [[H369]]

### 8
Then the fishermen [[H1771]] will mourn, [[H578]] all [[H3605]] who cast [[H7993]] hooks [[H2443]] into the Nile [[H2975]] will lament, [[H56]] and those who spread [[H6566]] nets [[H4365]] on [[H5921]] the water [[H4325]] will grieve. [[H535]]

### 9
Those who work [[H5647]] with flax [[H6593]] will be dismayed, [[H954]] and the weavers [[H707]] of fine linen [[H8305]] will turn pale. [[H2355]]

### 10
The workers in cloth [[H8356]] will be [[H1961]] dejected, [[H1792]] and all [[H3605]] the wage [[H7938]] earners [[H6213]] will be sick [[H99]] at heart. [[H5315]]

### 11
The princes [[H8269]] of Zoan [[H6814]] are mere [[H389]] fools; [[H196]] Pharaoh’s [[H6547]] wise [[H2450]] counselors [[H6098]] give senseless [[H1197]] advice. [[H6098]] How [[H349]] can you say [[H559]] to [[H413]] Pharaoh, [[H6547]] “I [[H589]] am one [[H1121]] of the wise, [[H2450]] a son [[H1121]] of eastern [[H6924]] kings”? [[H4428]]

### 12
Where [[H335]] are your wise men [[H2450]] now? [[H645]] Let them tell you [[H5046]] and reveal [[H3045]] what [[H4100]] the LORD [[H3069]] of Hosts [[H6635]] has planned [[H3289]] against [[H5921]] Egypt. [[H4714]]

### 13
The princes [[H8269]] of Zoan [[H6814]] have become fools; [[H2973]] the princes [[H8269]] of Memphis [[H5297]] are deceived. [[H5377]] The cornerstones [[H6438]] of her tribes [[H7626]] have led Egypt [[H4714]] astray. [[H8582]]

### 14
The LORD [[H3068]] has poured [[H4537]] into her [[H7130]] a spirit [[H7307]] of confusion. [[H5773]] Egypt [[H4714]] has been led astray [[H8582]] in all [[H3605]] she does, [[H4639]] as a drunkard [[H7910]] staggers around [[H8582]] in his vomit. [[H6892]]

### 15
There is [[H1961]] nothing [[H3808]] Egypt [[H4714]] can do— [[H6213]] head [[H7218]] or tail, [[H2180]] palm [[H3712]] or reed. [[H100]]

### 16
In that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] the Egyptians [[H4714]] will become [[H1961]] like women. [[H802]] They will tremble [[H2729]] with fear [[H6342]] beneath [[H6440]] the uplifted [[H8573]] hand [[H3027]] of the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts, [[H6635]] when He [[H1931]] brandishes [[H5130]] it [[H834]] against them. [[H5921]]

### 17
The land [[H127]] of Judah [[H3063]] will bring terror [[H2283]] to Egypt; [[H4714]] whenever [[H3605]] Judah is mentioned, [[H2142]] Egypt will tremble [[H6342]] over [[H6440]] what the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts [[H6635]] has planned [[H6098]] against it. [[H5921]]

### 18
In that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] five [[H2568]] cities [[H5892]] in the land [[H776]] of Egypt [[H4714]] will speak [[H1696]] the language [[H8193]] of Canaan [[H3667]] and swear allegiance [[H7650]] to the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts. [[H6635]] One of them [[H259]] will be called [[H559]] the City [[H5892]] of the Sun. [[H2041]]

### 19
In that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] there will be [[H1961]] an altar [[H4196]] to the LORD [[H3068]] in the center [[H8432]] of the land [[H776]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] and a pillar [[H4676]] to the LORD [[H3068]] near [[H681]] her border. [[H1366]]

### 20
It will be [[H1961]] a sign [[H226]] and a witness [[H5707]] to the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts [[H6635]] in the land [[H776]] of Egypt. [[H4714]] When [[H3588]] they cry out [[H6817]] to [[H413]] the LORD [[H3068]] because of [[H6440]] their oppressors, [[H3905]] He will send [[H7971]] them a savior [[H3467]] and defender [[H7227]] to rescue them. [[H5337]]

### 21
The LORD [[H3068]] will make Himself known [[H3045]] to Egypt, [[H4714]] and on that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] Egypt [[H4714]] will acknowledge [[H3045]] the LORD. [[H3068]] They will worship [[H5647]] with sacrifices [[H2077]] and offerings; [[H4503]] they will make [[H5087]] vows [[H5088]] to the LORD [[H3068]] and fulfill them. [[H7999]]

### 22
And the LORD [[H3068]] will strike [[H5062]] Egypt {with a plague}; [[H4714]] He will strike them [[H5062]] but heal them. [[H7495]] They will turn [[H7725]] to [[H5704]] the LORD, [[H3068]] and He will hear their prayers [[H6279]] and  heal them. [[H7495]]

### 23
In that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] there will be [[H1961]] a highway [[H4546]] from Egypt [[H4714]] to Assyria. [[H804]] The Assyrians [[H804]] will go [[H935]] to Egypt, [[H4714]] and the Egyptians [[H4714]] to Assyria. [[H804]] The Egyptians [[H4714]] and Assyrians [[H804]] will worship together. [[H5647]]

### 24
In that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] Israel [[H3478]] will join [[H1961]] a three-party [[H7992]] alliance with Egypt [[H4714]] and Assyria— [[H804]] a blessing [[H1293]] upon [[H7130]] the earth. [[H776]]

### 25
The LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts [[H6635]] will bless [[H1288]] them, [[H834]] saying, [[H559]] “Blessed [be] [[H1288]] Egypt [[H4714]] My people, [[H5971]] Assyria [[H804]] My handiwork, [[H4639]] and Israel [[H3478]] My inheritance.” [[H5159]]
