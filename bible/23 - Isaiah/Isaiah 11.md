[[Isaiah 10|←]] • [[Isaiah 12|→]]

---

###### 1
A shoot [[H2415]] will spring up [[H3318]] from the stump [[H1503]] of Jesse, [[H3448]] and a branch [[H5342]] from his roots [[H8328]] will bear fruit. [[H6509]]

###### 2
The Spirit [[H7307]] of the LORD [[H3068]] will rest [[H5117]] on Him— [[H5921]] the Spirit [[H7307]] of wisdom [[H2451]] and understanding, [[H998]] the Spirit [[H7307]] of counsel [[H6098]] and strength, [[H1369]] the Spirit [[H7307]] of knowledge [[H1847]] and the fear [[H3374]] of the LORD. [[H3068]]

###### 3
And He will delight [[H7306]] in the fear [[H3374]] of the LORD. [[H3068]] He will not [[H3808]] judge [[H8199]] by what His eyes [[H5869]] see, [[H4758]] and He will not [[H3808]] decide [[H3198]] by what His ears [[H241]] hear, [[H4926]]

###### 4
but with righteousness [[H6664]] He will judge [[H8199]] the poor, [[H1800]] and with equity [[H4334]] He will decide in favor [[H3198]] of the earth’s [[H776]] oppressed. [[H6035]] He will strike [[H5221]] the earth [[H776]] with the rod [[H7626]] of His mouth [[H6310]] and slay [[H4191]] the wicked [[H7563]] with the breath [[H7307]] of His lips. [[H8193]]

###### 5
Righteousness [[H6664]] will be [[H1961]] the belt [[H232]] around His hips, [[H4975]] and faithfulness [[H530]] the sash [[H232]] around His waist. [[H2504]]

###### 6
The wolf [[H2061]] will live [[H1481]] with [[H5973]] the lamb, [[H3532]] and the leopard [[H5246]] will lie down [[H7257]] with [[H5973]] the goat; [[H1423]] the calf [[H5695]] and young lion [[H3715]] and fatling [[H4806]] will be together, [[H3162]] and a little child [[H5288]] will lead [[H5090]] them. 

###### 7
The cow [[H6510]] will graze [[H7462]] with the bear, [[H1677]] their young [[H3206]] will lie down [[H7257]] together, [[H3162]] and the lion [[H738]] will eat [[H398]] straw [[H8401]] like the ox. [[H1241]]

###### 8
The infant [[H3243]] will play [[H8173]] by [[H5921]] the cobra’s [[H6620]] den, [[H2356]] and the toddler [[H1580]] will reach [[H1911]] into [[H5921]] the viper’s [[H6848]] nest. [[H3975]]

###### 9
They will neither [[H3808]] harm [[H7489]] nor [[H3808]] destroy [[H7843]] on all [[H3605]] My holy [[H6944]] mountain, [[H2022]] for [[H3588]] the earth [[H776]] will be full [[H4390]] of the knowledge [[H1844]] of the LORD [[H3069]] as the sea [[H3220]] is full [[H3680]] of water. [[H4325]]

###### 10
On that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] the root [[H8328]] of Jesse [[H3448]] will stand [[H5975]] as a banner [[H5251]] for the peoples. [[H5971]] The nations [[H1471]] will seek Him, [[H1875]] and His place of rest [[H4496]] will be glorious. [[H3519]]

###### 11
On that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] the Lord [[H136]] will extend His hand [[H3027]] a second time [[H8145]] to recover [[H7069]] the remnant [[H7605]] of His people [[H5971]] from Assyria, [[H804]] from Egypt, [[H4714]] from Pathros, [[H6624]] from Cush, [[H3568]] from Elam, [[H5867]] from Shinar, [[H8152]] from Hamath, [[H2574]] and from the islands [[H339]] of the sea. [[H3220]]

###### 12
He will raise [[H5375]] a banner [[H5251]] for the nations [[H1471]] and gather [[H622]] the exiles [[H1760]] of Israel; [[H3478]] He will collect [[H6908]] the scattered [[H5310]] of Judah [[H3063]] from the four [[H702]] corners [[H3671]] of the earth. [[H776]]

###### 13
Then the jealousy [[H7068]] of Ephraim [[H669]] will depart, [[H5493]] and the adversaries [[H6862]] of Judah [[H3063]] will be cut off. [[H3772]] Ephraim [[H669]] will no longer [[H3808]] envy [[H7065]] Judah, [[H3063]] nor will [[H3808]] Judah [[H3063]] harass [[H6887]] Ephraim. [[H669]]

###### 14
They will swoop down [[H5774]] on the slopes [[H3802]] of the Philistines [[H6430]] to the west; [[H3220]] together [[H3162]] they will plunder [[H962]] the people [[H1121]] of the east. [[H6924]] They will lay [[H4916]] their hands [[H3027]] on Edom [[H123]] and Moab, [[H4124]] and the Ammonites [[H1121]] will be subject to them. [[H8085]]

###### 15
The LORD [[H3068]] will devote to destruction [[H2763]] the gulf [[H3956]] of the Egyptian [[H4714]] Sea; [[H3220]] with a scorching [[H5868]] wind [[H7307]] He will sweep [[H5130]] His hand [[H3027]] over [[H5921]] the Euphrates. [[H5104]] He will split [[H5221]] it into seven [[H7651]] streams, [[H5158]] for men to cross [[H1869]] with dry sandals. [[H5275]]

###### 16
There will be [[H1961]] a highway [[H4546]] for the remnant [[H7605]] of His people [[H5971]] who [[H834]] remain [[H7604]] from Assyria, [[H804]] as [[H834]] there was [[H1961]] for Israel [[H3478]] when [[H3117]] they came up [[H5927]] from the land [[H776]] of Egypt. [[H4714]]
