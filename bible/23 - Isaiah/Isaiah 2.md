# Isaiah 2

[[Isaiah 1|←]] • [[Isaiah 3|→]]

---

### 1
[This is] the message [[H1697]] that [[H834]] was revealed [[H2372]] to Isaiah [[H3470]] son [[H1121]] of Amoz [[H531]] concerning [[H5921]] Judah [[H3063]] and Jerusalem: [[H3389]]

### 2
In the last [[H319]] days [[H3117]] the mountain [[H2022]] of the house [[H1004]] of the LORD [[H3068]] will be [[H1961]] established [[H3559]] as the chief [[H7218]] of the mountains; [[H2022]] it will be raised [[H5375]] above the hills, [[H1389]] and all [[H3605]] nations [[H1471]] will stream [[H5102]] to it. [[H413]]

### 3
And many [[H7227]] peoples [[H5971]] will come [[H1980]] and say, [[H559]] “Come, [[H1980]] let us go up [[H5927]] to [[H413]] the mountain [[H2022]] of the LORD, [[H3069]] to [[H413]] the house [[H1004]] of the God [[H430]] of Jacob. [[H3290]] He will teach us [[H3384]] His ways [[H1870]] so that we may walk [[H1980]] in His paths.” [[H734]] For [[H3588]] the law [[H8451]] will go forth [[H3318]] from Zion, [[H6726]] and the word [[H1697]] of the LORD [[H3069]] from Jerusalem. [[H3389]]

### 4
Then He will judge [[H8199]] between [[H996]] the nations [[H1471]] and arbitrate [[H3198]] for many [[H7227]] peoples. [[H5971]] They will beat [[H3807]] their swords [[H2719]] into plowshares [[H855]] and their spears [[H2595]] into pruning hooks. [[H4211]] Nation [[H1471]] will no longer [[H3808]] take up [[H5375]] the sword [[H2719]] against [[H413]] nation, [[H1471]] nor [[H3808]] train [[H3925]] anymore [[H5750]] for war. [[H4421]]

### 5
Come, [[H1980]] O house [[H1004]] of Jacob, [[H3290]] let us walk [[H1980]] in the light [[H216]] of the LORD. [[H3068]]

### 6
For [[H3588]] You have abandoned [[H5203]] Your people, [[H5971]] the house [[H1004]] of Jacob, [[H3290]] because [[H3588]] they are filled [[H4390]] [with influences] from the east; [[H6924]] they are soothsayers [[H6049]] like the Philistines; [[H6430]] they strike [hands] [[H5606]] with the children [[H3206]] of foreigners. [[H5237]]

### 7
Their land [[H776]] is full of [[H4390]] silver [[H3701]] and gold, [[H2091]] with no [[H369]] limit [[H7097]] to their treasures; [[H214]] their land [[H776]] is full of [[H4390]] horses, [[H5483]] with no [[H369]] limit [[H7097]] to their chariots. [[H4818]]

### 8
Their land [[H776]] is full of [[H4390]] idols; [[H457]] they bow down [[H7812]] to the work [[H4639]] of their hands, [[H3027]] to what [[H834]] their fingers [[H676]] have made. [[H6213]]

### 9
So mankind [[H120]] is brought low, [[H7817]] and man [[H376]] is humbled— [[H8213]] do not [[H408]] forgive them! [[H5375]]

### 10
Go [[H935]] into the rocks [[H6697]] and hide [[H2934]] in the dust [[H6083]] from [[H6440]] the terror [[H6343]] of the LORD [[H3068]] and the splendor [[H1926]] of His majesty. [[H1347]]

### 11
The proud [[H1365]] look [[H5869]] of man [[H120]] will be humbled, [[H8213]] and the loftiness [[H7312]] of men [[H376]] brought low; [[H7817]] the LORD [[H3068]] alone [[H905]] will be exalted [[H7682]] in that [[H1931]] day. [[H3117]]

### 12
For [[H3588]] the Day [[H3117]] of the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts [[H6635]] [will come] against [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] the proud [[H1343]] and lofty, [[H7311]] against [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] that is exalted— [[H5375]] it will be humbled— [[H8213]]

### 13
against [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] the cedars [[H730]] of Lebanon, [[H3844]] lofty [[H7311]] and lifted up, [[H5375]] against [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] the oaks [[H437]] of Bashan, [[H1316]]

### 14
against [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] the tall [[H7311]] mountains, [[H2022]] against [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] the high [[H5375]] hills, [[H1389]]

### 15
against [[H5921]] every [[H3605]] high [[H1364]] tower, [[H4026]] against [[H5921]] every [[H3605]] fortified [[H1219]] wall, [[H2346]]

### 16
against [[H5921]] every [[H3605]] ship [[H591]] of Tarshish, [[H8659]] [and] [[H5921]] every [[H3605]] stately [[H2532]] vessel. [[H7914]]

### 17
So the pride [[H1365]] of man [[H120]] will be brought low, [[H7817]] and the loftiness [[H7312]] of men [[H376]] will be humbled; [[H8213]] the LORD [[H3068]] alone [[H905]] will be exalted [[H7682]] in that [[H1931]] day, [[H3117]]

### 18
and the idols [[H457]] will vanish [[H2498]] completely. [[H3632]]

### 19
Men will flee [[H935]] to caves [[H4631]] in the rocks [[H6697]] and holes [[H4247]] in the ground, [[H6083]] away from [[H6440]] the terror [[H6343]] of the LORD [[H3068]] and from the splendor [[H1926]] of His majesty, [[H1347]] when He rises [[H6965]] to shake [[H6206]] the earth. [[H776]]

### 20
In that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] men [[H120]] will cast away [[H7993]] their idols [[H457]] of silver [[H3701]] and [[H853]] gold— [[H2091]] [the idols] [[H834]] they made [[H6213]] to worship— [[H7812]] away to the moles [[H2661]] and bats. [[H5847]]

### 21
They will flee [[H935]] to caverns [[H5366]] in the rocks [[H6697]] and crevices [[H5585]] in the cliffs, [[H5553]] away from [[H6440]] the terror [[H6343]] of the LORD [[H3068]] and from the splendor [[H1926]] of His majesty, [[H1347]] when He rises [[H6965]] to shake [[H6206]] the earth. [[H776]]

### 22
Put no more trust [[H2308]] in [[H4480]] man, [[H120]] who [[H834]] has only the breath [[H5397]] in his nostrils. [[H639]] Of what [[H4100]] account [[H2803]] is he? [[H1931]]
