###### 1
“Shout for joy, [[H7442]] O barren woman, [[H6135]] who bears no children; [[H3205]] break forth [[H6476]] into song [[H7440]] and cry aloud, [[H6670]] you who have never [[H3808]] travailed; [[H2342]] because [[H3588]] more [[H7227]] [are] the children [[H1121]] of the desolate woman [[H8074]] [than] [[H1121]] of her who has a husband,” [[H1166]] says [[H559]] the LORD. [[H3068]]

###### 2
“Enlarge [[H7337]] the site [[H4725]] of your tent, [[H168]] stretch out [[H5186]] the curtains [[H3407]] of your dwellings, [[H4908]] do not [[H408]] hold back. [[H2820]] Lengthen [[H748]] your ropes [[H4340]] and drive your stakes deep. [[H3489]]

###### 3
For [[H3588]] you will spread out [[H6555]] to the right [[H3225]] and left; [[H8040]] your descendants [[H2233]] will dispossess [[H3423]] the nations [[H1471]] and inhabit [[H3427]] the desolate [[H8074]] cities. [[H5892]]

###### 4
Do not [[H408]] be afraid, [[H3372]] for [[H3588]] you will not [[H3808]] be put to shame; [[H954]] do not [[H408]] be humiliated, [[H3637]] for [[H3588]] you will not [[H3808]] be disgraced. [[H2659]] For [[H3588]] you will forget [[H7911]] the shame [[H1322]] of your youth, [[H5934]] and remember [[H2142]] no [[H3808]] more [[H5750]] the reproach [[H2781]] of your widowhood. [[H491]]

###### 5
For [[H3588]] your husband [[H1166]] is your Maker— [[H6213]] the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts [[H6635]] [is] His name— [[H8034]] the Holy [[H6918]] One of Israel [[H3478]] is your Redeemer; [[H1350]] He is called [[H7121]] the God [[H430]] of all [[H3605]] the earth. [[H776]]

###### 6
For [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3069]] has called you back, [[H7121]] like a wife [[H802]] deserted [[H5805]] and wounded [[H6087]] in spirit, [[H7307]] the wife [[H802]] of one’s youth [[H5271]] when [[H3588]] she is rejected,” [[H3988]] says [[H559]] your God. [[H430]]

###### 7
For a brief [[H6996]] moment [[H7281]] I forsook you, [[H5800]] but with great [[H1419]] compassion [[H7356]] I will bring you back. [[H6908]]

###### 8
In a surge [[H8241]] of anger [[H7110]] I hid [[H5641]] My face [[H6440]] from you [[H4480]] for a moment, [[H7281]] but with everlasting [[H5769]] kindness [[H2617]] I will have compassion on you,” [[H7355]] says [[H559]] the LORD [[H3068]] your Redeemer. [[H1350]]

###### 9
“For [[H3588]] to Me  this is like [[H2063]] the days of Noah, [[H5146]] when [[H834]] I swore [[H7650]] that the waters [[H4325]] of Noah [[H5146]] would never again [[H5750]] cover [[H5674]] the earth. [[H776]] So [[H3651]] I have sworn [[H7650]] that I will not be angry [[H7107]] with you [[H5921]] or rebuke [[H1605]] you. 

###### 10
Though [[H3588]] the mountains [[H2022]] may be removed [[H4185]] and the hills [[H1389]] may be shaken, [[H4131]] My loving devotion [[H2617]] will not [[H3808]] depart from you, [[H4185]] and My covenant [[H1285]] of peace [[H7965]] will not [[H3808]] be broken,” [[H4131]] says [[H559]] the LORD, [[H3068]] who has compassion on you. [[H7355]]

###### 11
“O afflicted city, [[H6041]] lashed by storms, [[H5590]] without [[H3808]] solace, [[H5162]] surely [[H2009]] I [[H595]] will set [[H7257]] your stones [[H68]] in antimony [[H6320]] and lay your foundations [[H3245]] with sapphires. [[H5601]]

###### 12
I will make [[H7760]] your pinnacles [[H8121]] of rubies, [[H3539]] your gates [[H8179]] of sparkling [[H688]] jewels, [[H68]] and all [[H3605]] your walls [[H1366]] of precious [[H2656]] stones. [[H68]]

###### 13
Then all [[H3605]] your sons [[H1121]] will be taught [[H3928]] by the LORD, [[H3068]] and great [[H7227]] [will be their] [[H1121]] prosperity. [[H7965]]

###### 14
In righteousness [[H6666]] you will be established, [[H3559]] far [[H7368]] from oppression, [[H6233]] for [[H3588]] you will have no [[H3808]] fear, [[H3372]] and [removed] from terror, [[H4288]] for [[H3588]] it will not [[H3808]] come near [[H7126]] you. [[H413]]

###### 15
If [[H2005]] anyone attacks [[H1481]] you, [[H1481]] it is not [[H657]] from Me; [[H853]] whoever [[H4310]] assails you [[H1481]] will fall [[H5307]] before you. [[H5921]]

###### 16
Behold, [[H2005]] I [[H595]] have created [[H1254]] the craftsman [[H2796]] who fans [[H5301]] the coals [[H6352]] into flame [[H784]] and forges [[H3318]] a weapon [[H3627]] fit for its task; [[H4639]] and I [[H595]] have created [[H1254]] the destroyer [[H7843]] to wreak havoc. [[H2254]]

###### 17
No [[H3808]] weapon [[H3627]] formed [[H3335]] against you [[H5921]] shall prosper, [[H6743]] and you will refute [[H7561]] every [[H3605]] tongue [[H3956]] that accuses [[H6965]] you. [[H854]] This [[H2063]] is the heritage [[H5159]] of the LORD’s [[H3068]] servants, [[H5650]] and their vindication [[H6666]] [is] from Me,” [[H853]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD. [[H3068]]
