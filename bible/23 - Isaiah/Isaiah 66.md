# Isaiah 66

[[Isaiah 65|←]] • [[Jeremiah 1|→]]

###### 1
This is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] says: [[H559]] “Heaven [[H8064]] is My throne, [[H3678]] and earth [[H776]] is My footstool. [[H1916]] What kind [[H335]] of house [[H1004]] will you build [[H1129]] for Me?  Or where [will be] [[H335]] My place [[H4725]] of repose? [[H4496]]

###### 2
[Has not] My hand [[H3027]] made [[H6213]] all [[H3605]] these things? [[H428]] And so they [[H428]] came into being, [[H1961]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD. [[H3068]] This is the one [[H2088]] I will esteem: [[H5027]] he who is humble [[H6041]] and contrite [[H5223]] in spirit, [[H7307]] who trembles [[H2730]] at [[H5921]] My word. [[H1697]]

###### 3
Whoever slaughters [[H7819]] an ox [[H7794]] is [like] one who slays [[H5221]] a man; [[H376]] whoever sacrifices [[H2076]] a lamb [[H7716]] [is like] one who breaks a dog’s [[H3611]] neck; [[H6202]] whoever presents [[H5927]] a grain offering [[H4503]] [is like] one who offers [[H2142]] pig’s [[H2386]] blood; [[H1818]] whoever offers incense [[H3828]] [is like] one who praises [[H1288]] an idol. [[H205]] Indeed, [[H1571]] they [[H1992]] have chosen [[H977]] their own ways [[H1870]] and delighted [[H2654]] in their abominations. [[H8251]]

###### 4
So [[H1571]] I [[H589]] will choose [[H977]] their punishment [[H8586]] and I will bring [[H935]] terror [[H4035]] upon them, [[H1992]] because [[H3282]] I called [[H7121]] and no [[H369]] one answered, [[H6030]] I spoke [[H1696]] and no one [[H3808]] listened. [[H8085]] But they did [[H6213]] what was evil [[H7451]] in My sight [[H5869]] and chose [[H977]] that in which [[H834]] I did not [[H3808]] delight. [[H2654]]

###### 5
You who tremble [[H2730]] at [[H413]] His word, [[H1697]] hear [[H8085]] the word [[H1697]] of the LORD: [[H3068]] “Your brothers [[H251]] who hate [[H8130]] and exclude you [[H5077]] because of [[H4616]] My name [[H8034]] have said, [[H559]] ‘Let the LORD [[H3068]] be glorified [[H3513]] that we may see [[H7200]] your joy!’ [[H8057]] But they [[H1992]] will be put to shame.” [[H954]]

###### 6
Hear [[H6963]] the uproar [[H7588]] from the city; [[H5892]] [listen to] the voice [[H6963]] from the temple! [[H1964]] [It is] the voice [[H6963]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] repaying [[H7999]] His enemies [[H341]] what they deserve! [[H1576]]

###### 7
Before [[H2962]] she was in labor, [[H2342]] she gave birth; [[H3205]] before [[H2962]] she was in pain, [[H2256]] she delivered [[H4422]] a boy. [[H2145]]

###### 8
Who [[H4310]] has heard [[H8085]] of such as this? [[H2063]] Who [[H4310]] has seen [[H7200]] such things? [[H428]] Can a country [[H776]] be born [[H2342]] in a [[H259]] day [[H3117]] or [[H518]] a nation [[H1471]] be delivered [[H3205]] in an instant? [[H6471]] Yet [[H3588]] as soon as Zion [[H6726]] was in labor, [[H2342]] she gave birth to [[H3205]] her children. [[H1121]]

###### 9
Shall I [[H589]] bring a baby to the point of birth [[H7665]] and not [[H3808]] deliver it?” [[H3205]] says [[H559]] the LORD. [[H3068]] “Or [[H518]] will I [[H589]] who deliver [[H3205]] close the womb?” [[H6113]] says [[H559]] your God. [[H430]]

###### 10
Be glad [[H8055]] for [[H854]] Jerusalem [[H3389]] and rejoice over her, [[H1523]] all [[H3605]] who love her. [[H157]] Rejoice greatly [[H7797]] with her, [[H854]] all [[H3605]] who mourn [[H56]] over her, [[H5921]]

###### 11
so that [[H4616]] you may nurse [[H3243]] and be satisfied [[H7646]] at her comforting [[H8575]] breasts; [[H7699]] you may drink deeply [[H4711]] and delight yourselves [[H6026]] in her glorious [[H3519]] abundance. [[H2123]]

###### 12
For [[H3588]] this is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] says: [[H559]] I will extend [[H5186]] peace [[H7965]] to her [[H413]] like a river, [[H5104]] and the wealth [[H3519]] of nations [[H1471]] like a flowing [[H7857]] stream; [[H5158]] you will nurse [[H3243]] and be carried [[H5375]] on [[H5921]] her arm, [[H6654]] and bounced [[H8173]] upon [[H5921]] [her] knees. [[H1290]]

###### 13
As a mother [[H517]] comforts her son, [[H5162]] so [[H3651]] I [[H595]] will comfort you, [[H5162]] and you will be consoled [[H5162]] over Jerusalem. [[H3389]]

###### 14
When you see, [[H7200]] you [[H3820]] will rejoice, [[H7797]] and you [[H6106]] will flourish [[H6524]] like grass; [[H1877]] then the hand [[H3027]] of the LORD [[H3068]] will be revealed [[H3045]] to [[H854]] His servants, [[H5650]] but His wrath will be shown [[H2194]] to His enemies. [[H341]]

###### 15
For [[H3588]] behold, [[H2009]] the LORD [[H3068]] will come [[H935]] with fire— [[H784]] His chariots [[H4818]] are like the whirlwind— [[H5492]] to execute [[H7725]] His anger [[H639]] with fury [[H2534]] and His rebuke [[H1606]] with flames [[H3851]] of fire. [[H784]]

###### 16
For [[H3588]] by fire [[H784]] and by His sword, [[H2719]] the LORD [[H3068]] will execute judgment [[H8199]] on [[H854]] all [[H3605]] flesh, [[H1320]] and many [[H7231]] will be slain [[H2491]] by the LORD. [[H3068]]

###### 17
“Those who dedicate [[H6942]] and purify [[H2891]] themselves to [[H413]] enter the groves— [[H1593]] to follow [[H310]] one [[H259]] in the midst [[H8432]] of those who eat [[H398]] the flesh [[H1320]] of swine [[H2386]] and vermin [[H8263]] and rats— [[H5909]] will perish [[H5486]] together,” [[H3162]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD. [[H3068]]

###### 18
“For I [know] [[H595]] their works [[H4639]] and thoughts; [[H4284]] the time is coming [[H935]] to gather [[H6908]] all [[H3605]] nations [[H1471]] and tongues, [[H3956]] and they will come [[H935]] and see [[H7200]] My glory. [[H3519]]

###### 19
I will establish [[H7760]] a sign among them, [[H226]] and I will send [[H7971]] survivors [[H6412]] from among them [[H1992]] to Tarshish, [[H8659]] Put, [[H6322]] and Lud [[H3865]] the archers, [[H4900]] [to] Tubal, [[H8422]] Javan, [[H3120]] and the islands [[H339]] far away, [[H7350]] [and] to [[H413]] the nations [[H1471]] who [[H834]] have not [[H3808]] heard [[H8085]] of My fame [[H8088]] or seen [[H7200]] My glory. [[H3519]] So they will proclaim [[H5046]] My glory [[H3519]] among the nations. [[H1471]]

###### 20
And they will bring [[H935]] all [[H3605]] your brothers [[H251]] from all [[H3605]] the nations [[H1471]] as a gift [[H4503]] to the LORD [[H3068]] on horses [[H5483]] and chariots [[H7393]] and wagons, [[H6632]] on mules [[H6505]] and camels, [[H3753]] to [[H5921]] My holy [[H6944]] mountain [[H2022]] Jerusalem,” [[H3389]] says [[H559]] the LORD, [[H3068]] “just as [[H834]] the Israelites [[H1121]] bring [[H935]] an offering [[H4503]] in a clean [[H2889]] vessel [[H3627]] to the house [[H1004]] of the LORD. [[H3068]]

###### 21
And I will [[H1571]] select [[H3947]] some of them [[H1992]] as priests [[H3548]] and Levites,” [[H3881]] says [[H559]] the LORD. [[H3068]]

###### 22
“For [[H3588]] just as [[H834]] the new [[H2319]] heavens [[H8064]] and the new [[H2319]] earth, [[H776]] which [[H834]] I [[H589]] will make, [[H6213]] will endure [[H5975]] before Me,” [[H6440]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD, [[H3068]] “so [[H3651]] your descendants [[H2233]] and your name [[H8034]] will endure. [[H5975]]

###### 23
From [[H1767]] one New Moon [[H2320]] to another [[H2320]] and from [[H1767]] one Sabbath [[H7676]] to another, [[H7676]] all [[H3605]] mankind [[H1320]] will come [[H935]] to worship [[H7812]] before Me,” [[H6440]] says [[H559]] the LORD. [[H3068]]

###### 24
“As they go forth, [[H3318]] they will see [[H7200]] the corpses [[H6297]] of the men [[H376]] who have rebelled against Me; [[H6586]] for [[H3588]] their worm [[H8438]] will never [[H3808]] die, [[H4191]] their fire [[H784]] will never [[H3808]] be quenched, [[H3518]] and they will be [[H1961]] a horror [[H1860]] to all [[H3605]] mankind.” [[H1320]]
