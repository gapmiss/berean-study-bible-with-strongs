# Isaiah 61

[[Isaiah 60|←]] • [[Isaiah 62|→]]

---

### 1
The Spirit [[H7307]] of the Lord [[H136]] GOD [[H3069]] is on Me, [[H5921]] because [[H3282]] the LORD [[H3068]] has anointed Me [[H4886]] to preach good news [[H1319]] to the poor. [[H6035]] He has sent Me [[H7971]] to bind up [[H2280]] the brokenhearted, [[H7665]] to proclaim [[H7121]] liberty [[H1865]] to the captives [[H7617]] and release from darkness [[H6495]] to the prisoners, [[H631]]

### 2
to proclaim [[H7121]] the year [[H8141]] of the LORD’s [[H3068]] favor [[H7522]] and the day [[H3117]] of our God’s [[H430]] vengeance, [[H5359]] to comfort [[H5162]] all [[H3605]] who mourn, [[H57]]

### 3
to provide [[H7760]] for those who grieve [[H57]] in Zion— [[H6726]] to give [[H5414]] them  a crown of beauty [[H6287]] for [[H8478]] ashes, [[H665]] the oil [[H8081]] of joy [[H8342]] for [[H8478]] mourning, [[H60]] and a garment [[H4594]] of praise [[H8416]] in place [[H8478]] of a spirit [[H7307]] of despair. [[H3544]] So they will be called [[H7121]] oaks [[H352]] of righteousness, [[H6664]] the planting [[H4302]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] that He may be glorified. [[H6286]]

### 4
They will rebuild [[H1129]] the ancient [[H5769]] ruins; [[H2723]] they will restore [[H6965]] the places long [[H7223]] devastated; [[H8074]] they will renew [[H2318]] the ruined [[H2721]] cities, [[H5892]] the desolations [[H8074]] of many [[H1755]] generations. [[H1755]]

### 5
Strangers [[H2114]] will stand [[H5975]] and feed [[H7462]] your flocks, [[H6629]] and foreigners [[H1121]] will be your plowmen [[H406]] and vinedressers. [[H3755]]

### 6
But you [[H859]] will be called [[H7121]] the priests [[H3548]] of the LORD; [[H3068]] they will speak [[H559]] of you as ministers [[H8334]] of our God; [[H430]] you will feed on [[H398]] the wealth [[H2428]] of the nations, [[H1471]] and you will boast [[H3235]] in their riches. [[H3519]]

### 7
Instead [[H8478]] of shame, [[H1322]] [My people will have a] double portion, [[H4932]] and [instead of] humiliation, [[H3639]] they will rejoice [[H7442]] in their share; [[H2506]] and so [[H3651]] they will inherit [[H3423]] a double portion [[H4932]] in their land, [[H776]] and everlasting [[H5769]] joy [[H8057]] will be [[H1961]] theirs. 

### 8
For [[H3588]] I, [[H589]] the LORD, [[H3068]] love [[H157]] justice; [[H4941]] I hate [[H8130]] robbery [[H1498]] and iniquity; [[H5930]] in My faithfulness [[H571]] I will give them [[H5414]] their recompense [[H6468]] and make [[H3772]] an everlasting [[H5769]] covenant with them. [[H1285]]

### 9
Their descendants [[H2233]] will be known [[H3045]] among the nations, [[H1471]] and their offspring [[H6631]] among [[H8432]] the peoples. [[H5971]] All [[H3605]] who see them [[H7200]] will acknowledge [[H5234]] that [[H3588]] they [[H1992]] are a people [[H2233]] the LORD [[H3068]] has blessed. [[H1288]]

### 10
I will rejoice greatly [[H7797]] in the LORD, [[H3068]] my soul [[H5315]] will exult [[H1523]] in my God; [[H430]] for [[H3588]] He has clothed me [[H3847]] with garments [[H899]] of salvation [[H3468]] and wrapped me [[H3271]] in a robe [[H4598]] of righteousness, [[H6666]] as a groom [[H2860]] wears a priestly [[H3547]] headdress, [[H6287]] and as a bride [[H3618]] adorns herself [[H5710]] with her jewels. [[H3627]]

### 11
For [[H3588]] as the earth [[H776]] brings forth [[H3318]] its growth, [[H6780]] and as a garden [[H1593]] enables seed [[H2221]] to spring up, [[H6779]] so [[H3651]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD [[H3068]] will cause righteousness [[H6666]] and praise [[H8416]] to spring up [[H6779]] before [[H5048]] all [[H3605]] the nations.
