### 1
Now [[H6258]] this is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] says— [[H559]] He who created you, [[H1254]] O Jacob, [[H3290]] and He who formed you, [[H3335]] O Israel: [[H3478]] “Do not [[H408]] fear, [[H3372]] for [[H3588]] I have redeemed you; [[H1350]] I have called [[H7121]] you by your name; [[H8034]] you are Mine! [[H859]]

### 2
When [[H3588]] you pass [[H5674]] through the waters, [[H4325]] I [[H589]] will be with you; [[H854]] and [when you go through] the rivers, [[H5104]] they will not [[H3808]] overwhelm you. [[H7857]] When [[H3588]] you walk [[H1980]] through [[H1119]] the fire, [[H784]] you will not [[H3808]] be scorched, [[H3554]] and the flames [[H3852]] will not [[H3808]] set you ablaze. [[H1197]]

### 3
For [[H3588]] I [am] [[H589]] the LORD [[H3069]] your God, [[H430]] the Holy [[H6918]] One of Israel, [[H3478]] your Savior; [[H3467]] I give [[H5414]] Egypt [[H4714]] [for] your ransom, [[H3724]] Cush [[H3568]] and Seba [[H5434]] in your place. [[H8478]]

### 4
Because [[H834]] you are precious [[H3365]] and honored [[H3513]] in My sight, [[H5869]] and [because] I [[H589]] love you, [[H157]] I will give [[H5414]] men [[H120]] in exchange for you [[H8478]] and nations [[H3816]] in place of [[H8478]] your life. [[H5315]]

### 5
Do not [[H408]] be afraid, [[H3372]] for [[H3588]] I [[H589]] am with you; [[H854]] I will bring [[H935]] your offspring [[H2233]] from the east, [[H4217]] and gather you [[H6908]] from the west. [[H4628]]

### 6
I will say [[H559]] to the north, [[H6828]] ‘Give them up!’ [[H5414]] and to the south, [[H8486]] ‘Do not [[H408]] hold them back!’ [[H3607]] Bring [[H935]] My sons [[H1121]] from afar, [[H7350]] and My daughters [[H1323]] from the ends [[H7097]] of the earth— [[H776]]

### 7
everyone [[H3605]] called [[H7121]] by My name [[H8034]] and created [[H1254]] for My glory, [[H3519]] whom I have indeed formed [[H3335]] [and] made.” [[H6213]]

### 8
Bring out [[H3318]] a people [[H5971]] who have [[H3426]] eyes [[H5869]] but are blind, [[H5787]] and who have ears [[H241]] but are deaf. [[H2795]]

### 9
All [[H3605]] the nations [[H1471]] gather [[H6908]] together [[H3162]] and the peoples [[H3816]] assemble. [[H622]] Who [[H4310]] among them  have declared [[H5046]] this, [[H2063]] and foretold [[H8085]] the former things? [[H7223]] Let them present [[H5414]] their witnesses [[H5707]] to vindicate themselves, [[H6663]] so that others may hear [[H8085]] and say, [[H559]] “It is true.” [[H571]]

### 10
“You [[H859]] are My witnesses,” [[H5707]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD, [[H3068]] “and My servant [[H5650]] whom [[H834]] I have chosen, [[H977]] so that [[H4616]] you may know [[H3045]] and believe [[H539]] Me  and understand [[H995]] that [[H3588]] I [[H589]] am He. [[H1931]] Before Me, [[H6440]] no [[H3808]] god [[H410]] was formed, [[H3335]] and none [[H3808]] will come [[H1961]] after Me. [[H310]]

### 11
I, [[H595]] yes I, [[H595]] am the LORD, [[H3068]] and there is no [[H369]] Savior [[H3467]] but Me. [[H1107]]

### 12
I [[H595]] alone decreed [[H5046]] and saved [[H3467]] and proclaimed— [[H8085]] [I,] and not [[H369]] some foreign god among you. [[H2114]] So you [[H859]] are My witnesses,” [[H5707]] declares [[H5002]] the LORD, [[H3068]] “that I [[H589]] am God. [[H410]]

### 13
Even [[H1571]] from eternity [[H3117]] I [am] [[H589]] He, [[H1931]] and none [[H369]] can deliver [[H5337]] out of My hand. [[H3027]] When I act, [[H6466]] who [[H4310]] can reverse it?” [[H7725]]

### 14
Thus [[H3541]] says [[H559]] the LORD [[H3068]] your Redeemer, [[H1350]] the Holy [[H6918]] One of Israel: [[H3478]] “For your sake, [[H4616]] I will send [[H7971]] to Babylon [[H894]] and bring [[H3381]] them all [[H3605]] as fugitives, [[H1281]] even the Chaldeans, [[H3778]] in the ships [[H591]] in which they rejoice. [[H7440]]

### 15
I [[H589]] am the LORD, [[H3068]] your Holy One, [[H6918]] the Creator [[H1254]] of Israel, [[H3478]] [and] your King.” [[H4428]]

### 16
Thus [[H3541]] says [[H559]] the LORD— [[H3068]] He who makes [[H5414]] a way [[H1870]] in the sea, [[H3220]] and a path [[H5410]] through surging [[H5794]] waters, [[H4325]]

### 17
who brings out [[H3318]] the chariots [[H7393]] and horses, [[H5483]] the armies [[H2428]] and warriors [[H5808]] together, [[H3162]] to lie down [[H7901]] [and] never [[H1077]] rise again, [[H6965]] to be extinguished, [[H1846]] quenched [[H3518]] like a wick— [[H6594]]

### 18
“Do not [[H408]] call to mind [[H2142]] the former things; [[H7223]] pay no [[H408]] attention [[H995]] to things of old. [[H6931]]

### 19
Behold, [[H2005]] I am about to do [[H6213]] something new; [[H2319]] even now [[H6258]] it is coming. [[H6779]] Do you not [[H3808]] see it? [[H3045]] Indeed, [[H637]] I will make [[H7760]] a way [[H1870]] in the wilderness [[H4057]] [and] streams [[H5104]] in the desert. [[H3452]]

### 20
The animals [[H2416]] of the field [[H7704]] will honor Me, [[H3513]] the jackals [[H8577]] and the owls, [[H1323]] because [[H3588]] I provide [[H5414]] water [[H4325]] in the wilderness, [[H4057]] [and] rivers [[H5104]] in the desert, [[H3452]] to give drink [[H8248]] to My chosen [[H972]] people. [[H5971]]

### 21
The people [[H5971]] I formed for Myself [[H3335]] will declare [[H5608]] My praise. [[H8416]]

### 22
But you have not [[H3808]] called [[H7121]] on Me, [[H853]] O Jacob, [[H3290]] because [[H3588]] you have grown weary of Me, [[H3021]] O Israel. [[H3478]]

### 23
You have not [[H3808]] brought [[H935]] Me  sheep [[H7716]] for burnt offerings, [[H5930]] nor honored Me [[H3513]] with your sacrifices. [[H2077]] I have not [[H3808]] burdened you [[H5647]] with offerings, [[H4503]] nor [[H3808]] wearied [[H3021]] you with incense. [[H3828]]

### 24
You have bought [[H7069]] Me  no [[H3808]] sweet cane [[H7070]] with [your] silver, [[H3701]] nor have you [[H3808]] satisfied Me [[H7301]] with the fat [[H2459]] of your sacrifices. [[H2077]] But [[H389]] you have burdened [[H5647]] Me with your sins; [[H2403]] you have wearied [[H3021]] Me with your iniquities. [[H5771]]

### 25
I, [[H595]] yes I, [[H595]] am He who [[H1931]] blots out [[H4229]] your transgressions [[H6588]] for My own sake [[H4616]] and remembers [[H2142]] your sins [[H2403]] no more. [[H3808]]

### 26
Remind Me, [[H2142]] let us argue the matter [[H8199]] together. [[H3162]] State your case, [[H5608]] so that [[H4616]] you [[H859]] may be vindicated. [[H6663]]

### 27
Your first [[H7223]] father [[H1]] sinned, [[H2398]] and your spokesmen [[H3887]] rebelled [[H6586]] against Me. 

### 28
So I will disgrace [[H2490]] the princes [[H8269]] of your sanctuary, [[H6944]] and consign [[H5414]] Jacob [[H3290]] to destruction [[H2764]] and Israel [[H3478]] to reproach. [[H1421]]
