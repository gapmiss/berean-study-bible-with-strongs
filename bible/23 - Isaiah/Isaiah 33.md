# Isaiah 33

[[Isaiah 32|←]] • [[Isaiah 34|→]]

---

###### 1
Woe [[H1945]] to you, [[H859]] O destroyer [[H7703]] never [[H3808]] destroyed, [[H7703]] O traitor [[H898]] never [[H3808]] betrayed! [[H898]] When you have finished [[H8552]] destroying, [[H7703]] you will be destroyed. [[H7703]] When you have finished [[H5239]] betraying, [[H898]] you will be betrayed. [[H898]]

###### 2
O LORD, [[H3068]] be gracious to us! [[H2603]] We wait for You. [[H6960]] Be [[H1961]] our strength [[H2220]] every morning [[H1242]] and [[H637]] our salvation [[H3444]] in time [[H6256]] of trouble. [[H6869]]

###### 3
The peoples [[H5971]] flee [[H5074]] the thunder [[H1995]] of Your voice; [[H6963]] the nations [[H1471]] scatter [[H5310]] when You rise. [[H7427]]

###### 4
Your spoil [[H7998]] will be gathered [[H622]] as if by locusts; [[H2625]] like a swarm [[H4944]] of locusts [[H1357]] men will pounce [[H8264]] on it. 

###### 5
The LORD [[H3068]] is exalted, [[H7682]] for [[H3588]] He dwells [[H7931]] on high; [[H4791]] He has filled [[H4390]] Zion [[H6726]] with justice [[H4941]] and righteousness. [[H6666]]

###### 6
There will be [[H1961]] times [[H6256]] of security for you— [[H530]] a storehouse [[H2633]] of salvation, [[H3444]] wisdom, [[H2451]] and knowledge. [[H1847]] The fear [[H3374]] of the LORD [[H3068]] is Zion’s treasure. [[H214]]

###### 7
Behold! [[H2005]] Their warriors [[H691]] cry aloud [[H6817]] in the streets; [[H2351]] the envoys [[H4397]] of peace [[H7965]] weep [[H1058]] bitterly. [[H4751]]

###### 8
The highways [[H4546]] are deserted; [[H8074]] travel [[H5674]] has ceased. [[H7673]] The treaty [[H1285]] has been broken, [[H6565]] the witnesses [[H5892]] are despised, [[H3988]] and human life [[H3808]] is disregarded. [[H2803]]

###### 9
The land [[H776]] mourns [[H56]] [and] languishes; [[H535]] Lebanon [[H3844]] is ashamed [[H2659]] and decayed. [[H7060]] Sharon [[H8289]] is [[H1961]] like a desert; [[H6160]] Bashan [[H1316]] and Carmel [[H3760]] shake off their leaves. [[H5287]]

###### 10
“Now [[H6258]] I will arise,” [[H6965]] says [[H559]] the LORD. [[H3068]] “Now [[H6258]] I will lift Myself up. [[H7311]] Now [[H6258]] I will be exalted. [[H5375]]

###### 11
You conceive [[H2029]] chaff; [[H2842]] you give birth to [[H3205]] stubble. [[H7179]] Your breath [[H7307]] is a fire [[H784]] that will consume you. [[H398]]

###### 12
The peoples [[H5971]] will be [[H1961]] burned [[H4955]] to ashes, [[H7875]] like thorns [[H6975]] cut down [[H3683]] and set [[H3341]] ablaze. [[H784]]

###### 13
You who are far off, [[H7350]] hear [[H8085]] what [[H834]] I have done; [[H6213]] you who are near, [[H7138]] acknowledge [[H3045]] My might.” [[H1369]]

###### 14
The sinners [[H2400]] in Zion [[H6726]] are afraid; [[H6342]] trembling [[H7461]] grips [[H270]] the ungodly: [[H2611]] “Who [[H4310]] of us can dwell with [[H1481]] a consuming [[H398]] fire? [[H784]] Who [[H4310]] of us can dwell with [[H1481]] everlasting [[H5769]] flames?” [[H4168]]

###### 15
He who walks [[H1980]] righteously [[H6666]] and speaks [[H1696]] with sincerity, [[H4339]] who refuses [[H3988]] gain [[H1215]] from extortion, [[H4642]] whose hand [[H3709]] never [[H5287]] takes [[H8551]] a bribe, [[H7810]] who stops [[H331]] his ears [[H241]] against [[H8085]] murderous plots [[H1818]] and shuts [[H6105]] his eyes tightly [[H5869]] against [[H7200]] evil— [[H7451]]

###### 16
he [[H1931]] will dwell [[H7931]] on the heights; [[H4791]] his refuge [[H4869]] will be the mountain [[H5553]] fortress; [[H4679]] his food [[H3899]] will be provided [[H5414]] [and] his water [[H4325]] assured. [[H539]]

###### 17
Your eyes [[H5869]] will see [[H2372]] the King [[H4428]] in His beauty [[H3308]] and behold [[H7200]] a land [[H776]] that stretches afar. [[H4801]]

###### 18
Your mind [[H3820]] will ponder [[H1897]] the former terror: [[H367]] “Where [[H346]] is he who tallies? [[H5608]] Where [[H346]] is he who weighs? [[H8254]] Where [[H346]] is he who counts [[H5608]] the towers?” [[H4026]]

###### 19
You will no [[H3808]] longer see [[H7200]] the insolent, [[H3267]] a people [[H5971]] whose speech [[H8193]] is unintelligible, [[H6012]] who stammer [[H3932]] in a language [[H3956]] that is not [[H369]] understood. [[H998]]

###### 20
Look [[H2372]] upon Zion, [[H6726]] the city [[H7151]] of our festivals. [[H4150]] Your eyes [[H5869]] will see [[H7200]] Jerusalem, [[H3389]] a peaceful [[H7600]] pasture, [[H5116]] a tent [[H168]] that does not [[H1077]] wander; [[H6813]] its tent pegs [[H3489]] will not [[H1077]] be pulled up, [[H5265]] nor [[H1077]] will any [[H3605]] of its cords [[H2256]] be loosened. [[H5423]]

###### 21
But [[H518]] there [[H8033]] the Majestic One, [[H117]] our LORD, [[H3068]] [will be] for us  a place [[H4725]] of rivers [[H5104]] and wide [[H7342]] canals, [[H2975]] where no [[H1077]] galley [[H590]] with oars [[H7885]] will go, [[H1980]] and majestic [[H117]] vessels [[H6716]] will not [[H3808]] pass. [[H5674]]

###### 22
For [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] is our Judge, [[H8199]] the LORD [[H3068]] is our lawgiver, [[H2710]] the LORD [[H3068]] is our King. [[H4428]] He [[H1931]] will save us. [[H3467]]

###### 23
Your ropes [[H2256]] are slack; [[H5203]] they cannot [[H1077]] secure [[H2388]] the mast [[H8650]] or spread [[H6566]] the sail. [[H5251]] Then [[H227]] an abundance [[H4766]] of spoils [[H7998]] will be divided, [[H2505]] [and even] the lame [[H6455]] will carry off plunder. [[H962]]

###### 24
And no [[H1077]] resident [of Zion] [[H7934]] will say, [[H559]] “I am sick.” [[H2470]] The people [[H5971]] who dwell [[H3427]] there  will be forgiven [[H5375]] their iniquity. [[H5771]]
