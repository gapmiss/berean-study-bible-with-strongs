###### 1
[This is] an oracle [[H4853]] concerning Moab: [[H4124]] Ar [[H6144]] in Moab [[H4124]] is ruined, [[H7703]] destroyed [[H1820]] in a night! [[H3915]] Kir in Moab [[H7024]] is devastated, [[H7703]] destroyed [[H1820]] in a night! [[H3915]]

###### 2
Dibon [[H1769]] goes up [[H5927]] to its temple [[H1004]] to weep [[H1065]] at its high places. [[H1116]] Moab [[H4124]] wails [[H3213]] over [[H5921]] Nebo, [[H5015]] as well as over [[H5921]] Medeba. [[H4311]] Every [[H3605]] head [[H7218]] is shaved, [[H7144]] every [[H3605]] beard [[H2206]] is cut off. [[H1639]]

###### 3
In its streets [[H2351]] they wear [[H2296]] sackcloth; [[H8242]] on [[H5921]] the rooftops [[H1406]] and in the public squares [[H7339]] they all [[H3605]] wail, [[H3213]] falling down [[H3381]] weeping. [[H1065]]

###### 4
Heshbon [[H2809]] and Elealeh [[H500]] cry out; [[H2199]] their voices [[H6963]] are heard [[H8085]] as far as [[H5704]] Jahaz. [[H3096]] Therefore [[H5921]] the soldiers [[H2502]] of Moab [[H4124]] cry out; [[H7321]] their souls [[H5315]] tremble [[H3415]] within. 

###### 5
My heart [[H3820]] cries out [[H2199]] over Moab; [[H4124]] her fugitives [[H1280]] flee as [[H5704]] far as Zoar, [[H6820]] as far as Eglath-shelishiyah; [[H5697]] with weeping [[H1065]] they ascend [[H5927]] the slope [[H4608]] of Luhith; [[H3872]] they lament [[H5782]] their destruction [[H7667]] on the road [[H1870]] to Horonaim. [[H2773]]

###### 6
The waters [[H4325]] of Nimrim [[H5249]] are [[H1961]] dried up; [[H4923]] the grass [[H2682]] is withered, [[H3001]] the foliage [[H1877]] is gone, [[H3615]] and the vegetation [[H3418]] has vanished. [[H3808]]

###### 7
So [[H5921]] they carry [[H5375]] their wealth [[H3502]] and belongings [[H6486]] over [[H5921]] the Brook [[H5158]] of the Willows. [[H6155]]

###### 8
For [[H3588]] their outcry [[H2201]] echoes [[H5362]] to the border [[H1366]] of Moab. [[H4124]] Their wailing [[H3215]] reaches Eglaim; [[H97]] [it is heard] [[H3215]] in Beer-elim. [[H879]]

###### 9
The waters [[H4325]] of Dimon [[H1775]] are full of [[H4390]] blood, [[H1818]] but [[H3588]] I will bring [[H7896]] more [[H3254]] upon [[H5921]] Dimon— [[H1775]] a lion [[H738]] on the fugitives [[H6413]] of Moab, [[H4124]] and on the remnant [[H7611]] of the land. [[H127]]
