[[2 Corinthians 13|←]] • [[Galatians 2|→]]

---

###### 1
Paul, [[G3972]] an apostle— [[G652]] [sent] not [[G3756]] from [[G575]] men [[G444]] nor [[G3761]] by [[G1223]] man, [[G444]] but [[G235]] by [[G1223]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ [[G5547]] and [[G2532]] God [[G2316]] [the] Father, [[G3962]] who [[G3588]] raised [[G1453]] Him [[G846]] from [[G1537]] [the] dead— [[G3498]]

###### 2
and [[G2532]] all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] brothers [[G80]] with [[G4862]] me, [[G1473]] To the [[G3588]] churches [[G1577]] of Galatia: [[G1053]]

###### 3
Grace [[G5485]] and [[G2532]] peace [[G1515]] to you [[G4771]] from [[G575]] God [[G2316]] our [[G1473]] Father [[G3962]] and [[G2532]] the Lord [[G2962]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ, [[G5547]]

###### 4
who [[G3588]] gave [[G1325]] Himself [[G1438]] for [[G5228]] our [[G1473]] sins [[G266]] to [[G3704]] rescue [[G1807]] us [[G1473]] from [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] present [[G1764]] evil [[G4190]] age, [[G165]] according to [[G2596]] the [[G3588]] will [[G2307]] of our [[G1473]] God [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] Father, [[G3962]]

###### 5
to whom [be] [[G3739]] glory [[G1391]] forever [[G165]] [and] [[G3588]] ever. [[G165]] Amen. [[G281]]

###### 6
I am astonished [[G2296]] how [[G3779]] quickly [[G5030]] you are deserting [[G3346]] the [One who] [[G3588]] called [[G2564]] you [[G4771]] by [[G1722]] [the] grace [[G5485]] of Christ [[G5547]] [and are turning] to [[G1519]] a different [[G2087]] gospel— [[G2098]]

###### 7
which [[G3739]] is [[G1510]] not even [[G3756]] [a gospel]. [[G243]] Evidently [[G1487]] some [[G5100]] [people] [[G3588]] are [[G1510]] troubling [[G5015]] you [[G4771]] and [[G2532]] trying [[G2309]] to distort [[G3344]] the [[G3588]] gospel [[G2098]] of Christ. [[G5547]]

###### 8
But [[G235]] even [[G2532]] if [[G1437]] we [[G1473]] or [[G2228]] an angel [[G32]] from [[G1537]] heaven [[G3772]] should preach a gospel [[G2097]] contrary to [[G3844]] the one [[G3739]] we preached [[G2097]] to you, [[G4771]] let him be [[G1510]] under a divine curse! [[G331]]

###### 9
As [[G5613]] we have said before, [[G4302]] so [[G2532]] now [[G737]] I say [[G3004]] again: [[G3825]] If [[G1487]] anyone [[G5100]] is preaching to you a gospel [[G2097]] contrary to [[G3844]] the one [[G3739]] you embraced, [[G3880]] let him be [[G1510]] under a divine curse! [[G331]]

###### 10
{Am I} now [[G737]] seeking the approval [[G3982]] of men, [[G444]] or [[G2228]] of God? [[G2316]] Or [[G2228]] am I striving [[G2212]] to please [[G700]] men? [[G444]] If [[G1487]] I were still trying to please [[G700]] men, [[G444]] I would not be [[G1510]] a servant [[G1401]] of Christ. [[G5547]]

###### 11
For [[G1063]] I certify [[G1107]] to you, [[G4771]] brothers, [[G80]] [that] the [[G3588]] gospel [[G2098]] I preached [[G2097]] is [[G1510]] not [[G3756]] devised by [[G2596]] man. [[G444]]

###### 12
I [[G1473]] did not [[G3761]] receive [[G3880]] it [[G846]] from [[G3844]] any man, [[G444]] nor [[G3777]] was I taught [it]; [[G1321]] rather, [ I received it ] [[G235]] by [[G1223]] revelation [[G602]] from Jesus [[G2424]] Christ. [[G5547]]

###### 13
For [[G1063]] you have heard of [[G191]] my [[G1699]] former [[G4218]] way of life [[G391]] in [[G1722]] Judaism, [[G2454]] how [[G3754]] severely [[G2596]] I persecuted [[G1377]] the [[G3588]] church [[G1577]] of God [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] tried to destroy [[G4199]] it. [[G846]]

###### 14
I was advancing [[G4298]] in [[G1722]] Judaism [[G2454]] beyond [[G5228]] many [[G4183]] of my contemporaries [[G4915]] [and] was [[G5225]] extremely [[G4057]] zealous [[G2207]] for the [[G3588]] traditions [[G3862]] of my [[G1473]] fathers. [[G3967]]

###### 15
But [[G1161]] when [[G3753]] God, [[G2316]] who [[G3588]] set me apart [[G873]] from [[G1537]] my [[G1473]] mother’s [[G3384]] womb [[G2836]] and [[G2532]] called [me] [[G2564]] by [[G1223]] His [[G846]] grace, [[G5485]] was pleased [[G2106]]

###### 16
to reveal [[G601]] His [[G846]] Son [[G5207]] in [[G1722]] me [[G1473]] so that [[G2443]] I might preach [[G2097]] Him [[G846]] among [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] Gentiles, [[G1484]] I did not rush to consult [[G4323]] with flesh [[G4561]] and [[G2532]] blood, [[G129]]

###### 17
nor [[G3761]] did I go up [[G424]] to [[G1519]] Jerusalem [[G2414]] to [[G4314]] the [[G3588]] apostles [[G652]] [who came] before [[G4253]] me, [[G1473]] but [[G235]] I went [[G565]] into [[G1519]] Arabia [[G688]] and [[G2532]] [later] [[G3825]] returned [[G5290]] to [[G1519]] Damascus. [[G1154]]

###### 18
Only after [[G1899]] three [[G5140]] years [[G2094]] did I go up [[G424]] to [[G1519]] Jerusalem [[G2414]] to confer with [[G2477]] Cephas, [[G2786]] and [[G2532]] I stayed [[G1961]] with [[G4314]] him [[G846]] fifteen [[G1178]] days. [[G2250]]

###### 19
But [[G1161]] I saw [[G3708]] none [[G3756]] of the [[G3588]] other [[G2087]] apostles [[G652]] except [[G1487]] James, [[G2385]] the [[G3588]] Lord’s [[G2962]] brother. [[G80]]

###### 20
I assure you [[G2400]] before [[G1799]] God [[G2316]] that [[G3754]] what [[G3739]] I am writing [[G1125]] to you [[G4771]] is no lie. [[G5574]]

###### 21
Later [[G1899]] I went [[G2064]] to [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] regions [[G2824]] of Syria [[G4947]] and [[G2532]] Cilicia. [[G2791]]

###### 22
I was [[G1510]] personally [[G4383]] unknown, [[G50]] however, [[G1161]] to the [[G3588]] churches [[G1577]] of Judea [[G2449]] that [are] [[G3588]] in [[G1722]] Christ. [[G5547]]

###### 23
They [[G1510]] only [[G3440]] heard [[G191]] the account: [[G3754]] “The [man who] [[G3588]] formerly [[G4218]] persecuted [[G1377]] us [[G1473]] {is} now [[G3568]] preaching [[G2097]] the [[G3588]] faith [[G4102]] {he} once [[G4218]] tried to destroy.” [[G4199]]

###### 24
And [[G2532]] they glorified [[G1392]] God [[G2316]] because of [[G1722]] me. [[G1473]]
