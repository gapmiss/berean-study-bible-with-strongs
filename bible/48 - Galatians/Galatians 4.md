###### 1
[What] [[G1161]] I am saying [is that] [[G3004]] as long as [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] heir [[G2818]] is [[G1510]] a child, [[G3516]] he is no different [[G1308]] from a slave, [[G1401]] [although] he is [[G1510]] the owner [[G2962]] of everything. [[G3956]]

###### 2
He is [[G1510]] subject to [[G5259]] guardians [[G2012]] and [[G2532]] trustees [[G3623]] until [[G891]] the [[G3588]] date set [[G4287]] by [his] [[G3588]] father. [[G3962]]

###### 3
So [[G3779]] also, [[G2532]] when [[G3753]] we were [[G1510]] children, [[G3516]] we [[G1473]] were [[G1510]] enslaved [[G1402]] under [[G5259]] the [[G3588]] basic principles [[G4747]] of the [[G3588]] world. [[G2889]]

###### 4
But [[G1161]] when [[G3753]] the [[G3588]] time [[G5550]] {had} fully [[G4138]] come, [[G2064]] God [[G2316]] sent [[G1821]] His [[G846]] Son, [[G5207]] born [[G1096]] of [[G1537]] a woman, [[G1135]] born [[G1096]] under [[G5259]] [the] Law, [[G3551]]

###### 5
to redeem [[G1805]] those [[G3588]] under [[G5259]] [the] Law, [[G3551]] that [[G2443]] we might receive [[G618]] [our] [[G3588]] adoption as sons. [[G5206]]

###### 6
And [[G1161]] because [[G3754]] you are [[G1510]] sons, [[G5207]] God [[G2316]] sent [[G1821]] the [[G3588]] Spirit [[G4151]] of [[G3588]] His [[G846]] Son [[G5207]] into [[G1519]] our [[G1473]] hearts, [[G2588]] crying out, [[G2896]] “Abba, [[G5]] Father!” [[G3962]]

###### 7
So [[G5620]] you are [[G1510]] no longer [[G3765]] a slave, [[G1401]] but [[G235]] a son; [[G5207]] and [[G1161]] since [you are] [[G1487]] a son, [[G5207]] [you are] also [[G2532]] an heir [[G2818]] through [[G1223]] God. [[G2316]]

###### 8
Formerly, [[G5119]] when you did not know [[G1492]] God, [[G2316]] you were slaves [[G1398]] to those who [[G3588]] by nature [[G5449]] are [[G1510]] not [[G3361]] gods. [[G2316]]

###### 9
But [[G1161]] now that [[G3568]] you know [[G1097]] God, [[G2316]] or rather [[G3123]] are known [[G1097]] by [[G5259]] God, [[G2316]] how [is it that] [[G4459]] you are turning [[G1994]] back [[G3825]] to [[G1909]] those [[G3588]] weak [[G772]] and [[G2532]] worthless [[G4434]] principles? [[G4747]] Do you wish [[G2309]] to be enslaved [[G1398]] by [them] [[G3739]] all over [[G509]] again? [[G3825]]

###### 10
You are observing [[G3906]] [special] days [[G2250]] and [[G2532]] months [[G3376]] and [[G2532]] seasons [[G2540]] and [[G2532]] years! [[G1763]]

###### 11
I fear [[G5399]] for you, [[G4771]] [that] [[G3361]] my efforts [[G2872]] for [[G1519]] you [[G4771]] may have been [[G4459]] in vain. [[G1500]]

###### 12
I beg [[G1189]] you, [[G4771]] brothers, [[G80]] become [[G1096]] like [[G5613]] me, [[G1473]] for [[G3754]] I became [[G2504]] like [[G5613]] you. [[G4771]] You have done me no wrong. [[G91]]

###### 13
You know [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] it was because of [[G1223]] an illness [[G769]] [that] I first preached the gospel [[G2097]] to you. [[G4771]]

###### 14
And [[G2532]] [although] [[G1722]] my [[G1473]] [illness] [[G4561]] [was a] trial [[G3986]] to you, [[G4771]] you did not despise [me] [[G1848]] [or] [[G3761]] reject [me]. [[G1609]] Instead, [[G235]] you welcomed [[G1209]] me [[G1473]] as if [I were] [[G5613]] an angel [[G32]] of God, [[G2316]] as if [I were] [[G5613]] Christ [[G5547]] Jesus [himself]. [[G2424]]

###### 15
What [[G4226]] then [has become] [[G3767]] of your [[G4771]] blessing? [[G3108]] For [[G1063]] I can testify [[G3140]] that, [[G3754]] if [[G1487]] [it were] possible, [[G1415]] you would have torn out [[G1846]] your [[G4771]] eyes [[G3788]] [and] given [them] [[G1325]] to me. [[G1473]]

###### 16
Have I now become [[G1096]] your [[G4771]] enemy [[G2190]] [by] telling you the truth? [[G226]]

###### 17
[Those people] are zealous for you, [[G2206]] [but] not [[G3756]] in a good way. [[G2573]] Instead, [[G235]] they want [[G2309]] to isolate [[G1576]] you [from us], [[G4771]] so that [[G2443]] you will be zealous [[G2206]] for them. [[G846]]

###### 18
Nevertheless, [[G1161]] [it is] good [[G2570]] to be zealous [[G2206]] if it serves [[G1722]] a noble [purpose]— [[G2570]] at any time, [[G3842]] and [[G2532]] not [[G3361]] only [[G3440]] when [[G1722]] I am [[G1473]] with [[G4314]] you. [[G4771]]

###### 19
My [[G1473]] children, [[G5043]] for whom [[G3739]] I am again [[G3825]] in the pains of childbirth [[G5605]] until [[G3360]] Christ [[G5547]] is formed [[G3445]] in [[G1722]] you, [[G4771]]

###### 20
[how] [[G1161]] I wish [[G2309]] I could be [[G3918]] with [[G4314]] you [[G4771]] now [[G737]] and [[G2532]] change [[G236]] my [[G1473]] tone, [[G5456]] because [[G3754]] I am perplexed [[G639]] about [[G1722]] you. [[G4771]]

###### 21
Tell [[G3004]] me, [[G1473]] [you] who [[G3588]] want [[G2309]] to be [[G1510]] under [[G5259]] [the] Law, [[G3551]] do you not understand [what] [[G191]] the [[G3588]] Law [says]? [[G3551]]

###### 22
For [[G1063]] it is written [[G1125]] that [[G3754]] Abraham [[G11]] had [[G2192]] two [[G1417]] sons, [[G5207]] one [[G1520]] by [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] slave woman [[G3814]] and [[G2532]] [the other] [[G1520]] by [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] free [woman]. [[G1658]]

###### 23
His [son] [[G3588]] by [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] slave woman [[G3814]] was born [[G1080]] according to [[G2596]] [the] flesh, [[G4561]] [but] [[G1161]] [his son] [[G3588]] by [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] free [woman] [[G1658]] [was born] because of [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] promise. [[G1860]]

###### 24
These [things] [[G3748]] serve as illustrations, [[G238]] for [[G1063]] [the women] [[G3778]] represent [[G1510]] two [[G1417]] covenants. [[G1242]] One [covenant] [[G1520]] [is] from [[G575]] Mount [[G3735]] Sinai [[G4614]] [and bears] children [[G1080]] into [[G1519]] slavery: [[G1397]] This [[G3748]] is [[G1510]] Hagar. [[G28]]

###### 25
Now [[G1161]] Hagar [[G28]] stands for [[G1510]] Mount [[G3735]] Sinai [[G4614]] in [[G1722]] Arabia [[G688]] and [[G1161]] corresponds [[G4960]] to the [[G3588]] present-day [[G3568]] Jerusalem, [[G2419]] because [[G1063]] she is in slavery [[G1398]] with [[G3326]] her [[G846]] children. [[G5043]]

###### 26
But [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] Jerusalem [[G2419]] above [[G507]] is [[G1510]] free, [[G1658]] [and she] [[G3748]] is [[G1510]] our [[G1473]] mother. [[G3384]]

###### 27
For [[G1063]] it is written: [[G1125]] “Rejoice, [[G2165]] [O] barren woman, [[G4723]] who [[G3588]] bears no children; [[G5088]] break forth [[G4486]] and [[G2532]] cry aloud, [[G994]] [you] who [[G3588]] {have} never [[G3756]] travailed; [[G5605]] because [[G3754]] more [[G3123]] [are] the [[G3588]] children [[G5043]] of the [[G3588]] desolate woman, [[G2048]] than [[G2228]] of her who [[G3588]] has [[G2192]] a husband. [[G435]]

###### 28
Now [[G1161]] you, [[G4771]] brothers, [[G80]] like [[G2596]] Isaac, [[G2464]] are [[G1510]] children [[G5043]] of [the] promise. [[G1860]]

###### 29
At that time, [[G5119]] however, [[G235]] the [son] [[G3588]] born [[G1080]] by [[G2596]] [the] flesh [[G4561]] persecuted [[G1377]] the [son born] [[G3588]] by [[G2596]] [the] Spirit. [[G4151]] [It is] the same [[G3779]] now. [[G3568]]

###### 30
But [[G235]] what [[G5101]] {does} the [[G3588]] Scripture [[G1124]] say? [[G3004]] “Expel [[G1544]] the [[G3588]] slave woman [[G3814]] and [[G2532]] her [[G846]] son, [[G5207]] for [[G1063]] the [[G3588]] slave woman’s [[G3814]] son [[G5207]] will never share in the inheritance with [[G2816]] the [[G3588]] free [woman’s] [[G1658]] son.” [[G5207]]

###### 31
Therefore, [[G1352]] brothers, [[G80]] we are [[G1510]] not [[G3756]] children [[G5043]] of [the] slave woman, [[G3814]] but [[G235]] of the [[G3588]] free [woman]. [[G1658]]
