### 1
Now when [[H1961]] news of this reached [[H8085]] all [[H3605]] the kings [[H4428]] west [[H5676]] of the Jordan— [[H3383]] those [[H834]] in the hill country, [[H2022]] the foothills, [[H8219]] and all [[H3605]] along the coast [[H2348]] of the Great [[H1419]] Sea [[H3220]] toward [[H413]] Lebanon [[H3844]] (the Hittites, [[H2850]] Amorites, [[H567]] Canaanites, [[H3669]] Perizzites, [[H6522]] Hivites, [[H2340]] and Jebusites)— [[H2983]]

### 2
they came [[H6908]] together [[H3162]] to wage war [[H3898]] against [[H5973]] Joshua [[H3091]] and Israel. [[H3478]]

### 3
But the people [[H3427]] of Gibeon, [[H1391]] having heard [[H8085]] what [[H834]] Joshua [[H3091]] had done [[H6213]] to Jericho [[H3405]] and Ai, [[H5857]]

### 4
acted deceptively [[H6213]] and set out [[H1980]] as envoys, [[H6737]] carrying [[H3947]] on their donkeys [[H2543]] worn-out [[H1087]] sacks [[H8242]] and old [[H1087]] wineskins, [[H4997]] cracked [[H1234]] and mended. [[H6887]]

### 5
They put worn, [[H1087]] patched [[H2921]] sandals [[H5275]] on their feet [[H7272]] and threadbare [[H1087]] clothing [[H8008]] on [their bodies], [[H5921]] and their whole [[H3605]] supply [[H6720]] of bread [[H3899]] was dry [[H3001]] [and] moldy. [[H5350]]

### 6
They went [[H1980]] to [[H413]] Joshua [[H3091]] in [[H413]] the camp [[H4264]] at Gilgal [[H1537]] and said [[H559]] to him [[H413]] and [[H413]] the men [[H376]] of Israel, [[H3478]] “We have come [[H935]] from a distant [[H7350]] land; [[H776]] please make [[H3772]] a treaty with us.” [[H1285]]

### 7
But the men [[H376]] of Israel [[H3478]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] the Hivites, [[H2340]] “Perhaps [[H194]] you [[H859]] dwell [[H3427]] near us. [[H7130]] How [[H349]] can we make [[H3772]] a treaty with you?” [[H1285]]

### 8
“We [[H587]] are your servants,” [[H5650]] they said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Joshua. [[H3091]] Then Joshua [[H3091]] asked them, [[H559]] “Who [[H4310]] are you [[H859]] and from where [[H370]] have you come?” [[H935]]

### 9
“Your servants [[H5650]] have come [[H935]] from a very [[H3966]] distant [[H7350]] land,” [[H776]] they replied, [[H559]] “because of the fame [[H8034]] of the LORD [[H3068]] your God. [[H430]] For [[H3588]] we have heard [[H8085]] the reports of Him [[H8089]] and [[H853]] all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] He did [[H6213]] in Egypt, [[H4714]]

### 10
as well as [[H853]] all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] He did [[H6213]] to the two [[H8147]] kings [[H4428]] of the Amorites [[H567]] beyond [[H5676]] the Jordan— [[H3383]] Sihon [[H5511]] king [[H4428]] of Heshbon [[H2809]] and Og [[H5747]] king [[H4428]] of Bashan, [[H1316]] who [[H834]] reigned in Ashtaroth. [[H6252]]

### 11
So the elders [[H2205]] and [[H3605]] inhabitants [[H3427]] of our land [[H776]] told [[H559]] us, [[H413]] ‘Take [[H3947]] provisions [[H6720]] for your journey; [[H1870]] go [[H1980]] to meet them [[H7125]] and say [[H559]] to them: [[H413]] We [[H587]] are your servants. [[H5650]] Please make [[H3772]] a treaty with us.’ [[H1285]]

### 12
This [[H2088]] bread [[H3899]] of ours was warm [[H2525]] when we packed it [[H6679]] at home [[H1004]] on the day [[H3117]] we left [[H3318]] to come [[H1980]] to you. [[H413]] But take a look, [[H2009]] it is now [[H6258]] dry [[H3001]] and [[H1961]] moldy. [[H5350]]

### 13
These [[H428]] wineskins [[H4997]] were new [[H2319]] when we filled [[H4390]] them, [[H834]] but look, [[H2009]] they are cracked. [[H1234]] And these [[H428]] clothes [[H8008]] and sandals [[H5275]] are worn out [[H1086]] from our very [[H3966]] long [[H7230]] journey.” [[H1870]]

### 14
Then the men of Israel [[H582]] sampled [[H3947]] their provisions, [[H6718]] but did not [[H3808]] seek [[H7592]] the counsel [[H6310]] of the LORD. [[H3068]]

### 15
And Joshua [[H3091]] made [[H6213]] a treaty [[H1285]] of peace [[H7965]] with them  to let them live, [[H2421]] and the leaders [[H5387]] of the congregation [[H5712]] swore an oath to them. [[H7650]]

### 16
Three [[H7969]] days [[H3117]] after [[H310]] they had made [[H3772]] the treaty with [the Gibeonites], [[H1285]] [the Israelites learned [[H8085]] that [[H3588]] they [were] [[H1992]] neighbors, [[H7138]] living [[H3427]] among them. [[H7130]]

### 17
So the Israelites [[H1121]] set out [[H5265]] and on the third [[H7992]] day [[H3117]] arrived [[H935]] at their cities— [[H5892]] Gibeon, [[H1391]] Chephirah, [[H3716]] Beeroth, [[H881]] and Kiriath-jearim. [[H7157]]

### 18
But the Israelites [[H1121]] did not [[H3808]] attack them, [[H5221]] because [[H3588]] the leaders [[H5387]] of the congregation [[H5712]] had sworn an oath [[H7650]] to them  by the LORD, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of Israel. [[H3478]] And the whole [[H3605]] congregation [[H5712]] grumbled [[H3885]] against [[H5921]] the leaders. [[H5387]]

### 19
All [[H3605]] the leaders [[H5387]] answered, [[H559]] “We [[H587]] have sworn an oath [[H7650]] to them by the LORD, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] and now [[H6258]] we cannot [[H3808]] touch [[H5060]] them. 

### 20
This [[H2063]] is how we will treat them: [[H6213]] We will let them live, [[H2421]] so that no [[H3808]] wrath [[H7110]] will fall [[H1961]] on [[H5921]] us because of [[H5921]] the oath [[H7621]] we swore [[H7650]] to them.” 

### 21
They [[H5387]] continued, [[H559]] “Let them live, [[H2421]] but let them be [[H1961]] woodcutters [[H2404]] and water [[H4325]] carriers [[H7579]] for the whole [[H3605]] congregation.” [[H5712]] So [[H834]] the leaders [[H5387]] kept their promise. [[H1696]]

### 22
Then Joshua [[H3091]] summoned [[H7121]] the Gibeonites  and said, [[H1696]] “Why [[H4100]] did you deceive [[H7411]] us [[H853]] by telling [[H559]] us you live far away [[H7350]] from [[H4480]] us, [[H587]] when in fact you [[H859]] live [[H3427]] among us? [[H7130]]

### 23
Now therefore [[H6258]] you [[H859]] are under a curse [[H779]] and will perpetually [[H3808]] serve [[H5650]] as woodcutters [[H2404]] and water [[H4325]] carriers [[H7579]] for the house [[H1004]] of my God.” [[H430]]

### 24
The Gibeonites answered, [[H6030]] “Your servants [[H5650]] were told [[H5046]] clearly [[H5046]] that [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] had commanded [[H6680]] His servant [[H5650]] Moses [[H4872]] to give [[H5414]] you all [[H3605]] the land [[H776]] and wipe out [[H8045]] all [[H3605]] its inhabitants [[H3427]] before you. [[H6440]] So we greatly [[H3966]] feared [[H3372]] for our lives [[H5315]] because of you, [[H6440]] and that is why we have done [[H6213]] this. [[H2088]]

### 25
Now [[H6258]] we are in your hands. [[H3027]] Do [[H6213]] to us  as it seems [[H5869]] good [[H2896]] and right [[H3477]] [to you].” [[H6213]]

### 26
So [[H3651]] Joshua did this [[H6213]] and delivered [[H5337]] them [[H853]] from the hands [[H3027]] of the Israelites, [[H1121]] and they did not [[H3808]] kill [the Gibeonites]. [[H2026]]

### 27
On that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] he [[H3091]] made [[H5414]] them woodcutters [[H2404]] and water [[H4325]] carriers, [[H7579]] as they are to this day, [[H5704]] for the congregation [[H5712]] of the LORD [[H3068]] and for the altar [[H4196]] at [[H413]] the place [[H4725]] He would choose.
