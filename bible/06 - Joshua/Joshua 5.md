###### 1
Now [[H1961]] when all [[H3605]] the Amorite [[H567]] kings [[H4428]] west of [[H3220]] the Jordan [[H3383]] and all [[H3605]] the Canaanite [[H3669]] kings [[H4428]] along [[H5921]] the coast [[H3220]] heard [[H8085]] how [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] had dried up [[H3001]] the waters [[H4325]] of the Jordan [[H3383]] before [[H6440]] the Israelites [[H1121]] until [[H5704]] they had crossed over, [[H5674]] their hearts [[H3824]] melted [[H4549]] and their spirit [[H7307]] failed [[H3808]] for fear of [[H6440]] the Israelites. [[H1121]]

###### 2
At that [[H1931]] time [[H6256]] the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Joshua, [[H3091]] “Make [[H6213]] flint [[H6697]] knives [[H2719]] and circumcise [[H4135]] the sons [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] once again.” [[H7725]]

###### 3
So Joshua [[H3091]] made [[H6213]] flint [[H6697]] knives [[H2719]] and circumcised [[H4135]] the sons [[H1121]] of Israel [[H3478]] at [[H413]] Gibeath-haaraloth. [[H1389]]

###### 4
Now this [[H2088]] is why [[H1697]] Joshua [[H3091]] circumcised them: [[H4135]] All [[H3605]] those [[H5971]] who came out [[H3318]] of Egypt— [[H4714]] all [[H3605]] the men [[H582]] of war— [[H4421]] had died [[H4191]] on the journey [[H1870]] in the wilderness [[H4057]] after they had left [[H3318]] Egypt. [[H4714]]

###### 5
Though [[H3588]] all [[H3605]] who had come out [[H3318]] were [[H1961]] circumcised, [[H4135]] none [[H3605]] of those [[H5971]] born [[H3209]] in the wilderness [[H4057]] on the journey [[H1870]] from Egypt [[H4714]] had been circumcised. [[H4135]]

###### 6
For [[H3588]] the Israelites [[H1121]] had wandered [[H1980]] in the wilderness [[H4057]] forty [[H705]] years, [[H8141]] until [[H5704]] all [[H3605]] the nation’s [[H1471]] men [[H376]] of war [[H4421]] who had come out [[H3318]] of Egypt [[H4714]] had died, [[H8552]] since [[H834]] they did not [[H3808]] obey [[H8085]] the LORD. [[H3068]] So [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] vowed [[H7650]] never [[H1115]] to let them see [[H7200]] the land [[H776]] He [[H3068]] had sworn [[H7650]] to their fathers [[H1]] to give us, [[H5414]] a land [[H776]] flowing [[H2100]] with milk [[H2461]] and honey. [[H1706]]

###### 7
And [[H853]] Joshua [[H3091]] raised up [[H6965]] their sons [[H1121]] in their place, [[H8478]] and these were the ones he circumcised. [[H4135]] [Until this time] they were [[H1961]] still uncircumcised, [[H6189]] since [[H3588]] they had not [[H3808]] been circumcised [[H4135]] on the way. [[H1870]]

###### 8
And [[H1961]] after [[H834]] all [[H3605]] the nation [[H1471]] had been circumcised, [[H4135]] they stayed [[H3427]] there [[H8478]] in the camp [[H4264]] until [[H5704]] they were healed. [[H2421]]

###### 9
Then the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Joshua, [[H3091]] “Today [[H3117]] I have rolled away [[H1556]] the reproach [[H2781]] of Egypt [[H4714]] from you.” [[H5921]] So that [[H1931]] place [[H4725]] has been called [[H7121]] Gilgal [[H1537]] to [[H5704]] this [[H2088]] day. [[H3117]]

###### 10
On the evening [[H6153]] of the fourteenth [[H702]] day [[H3117]] of the month, [[H2320]] while the Israelites [[H1121]] were camped [[H2583]] at Gilgal [[H1537]] on the plains [[H6160]] of Jericho, [[H3405]] they kept [[H6213]] the Passover. [[H6453]]

###### 11
The day after [[H4283]] the Passover, [[H6453]] on that very [[H6106]] day, [[H3117]] they ate [[H398]] unleavened bread [[H4682]] and roasted grain [[H7033]] from the produce [[H5669]] of the land. [[H776]]

###### 12
And the day [[H4283]] after they had eaten [[H398]] from the produce [[H5669]] of the land, [[H776]] the manna [[H4478]] ceased. [[H7673]] There was [[H1961]] no [[H3808]] more [[H5750]] manna [[H4478]] for the Israelites, [[H1121]] so that [[H1931]] year [[H8141]] they began to eat [[H398]] the crops [[H8393]] of the land [[H776]] of Canaan. [[H3667]]

###### 13
Now when Joshua [[H3091]] was [[H1961]] near Jericho, [[H3405]] he looked up [[H5375]] and saw [[H7200]] a man [[H376]] standing [[H5975]] in front of [[H5048]] him with a drawn [[H8025]] sword [[H2719]] in His hand. [[H3027]] Joshua [[H3091]] approached [[H1980]] Him [[H413]] and asked, [[H559]] “Are You [[H859]] for us or [[H518]] for our enemies?” [[H6862]]

###### 14
“Neither,” [[H3808]] He replied. [[H559]] “I [[H589]] have now [[H6258]] come [[H935]] as commander [[H8269]] of the LORD’s [[H3068]] army.” [[H6635]] Then Joshua [[H3091]] fell facedown [[H413]] in reverence [[H7812]] and asked [[H559]] Him,  “What [[H4100]] does my Lord [[H136]] have to say [[H1696]] to [[H413]] His servant?” [[H5650]]

###### 15
The commander [[H8269]] of the LORD’s [[H3068]] army [[H6635]] replied, [[H559]] “Take off [[H5394]] your sandals, [[H5275]] for [[H3588]] the place [[H4725]] where [[H834]] you [[H859]] are standing [[H5975]] is holy.” [[H6944]] And Joshua [[H3091]] did [[H6213]] so. [[H3651]]
