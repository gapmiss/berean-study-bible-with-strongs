###### 1
The allotment [[H1486]] for the descendants [[H1121]] of Joseph [[H3130]] extended [[H3318]] from the Jordan [[H3383]] at Jericho [[H3405]] to the waters [[H4325]] of Jericho [[H3405]] on the east, [[H4217]] through the wilderness [[H4057]] that goes up [[H5927]] from Jericho [[H3405]] into the hill country [[H2022]] of Bethel. [[H1008]]

###### 2
It went on [[H3318]] from Bethel [[H1008]] ([that is,] Luz) [[H3870]] and proceeded [[H5674]] to [[H413]] the border [[H1366]] of the Archites [[H757]] in Ataroth. [[H5852]]

###### 3
Then it descended [[H3381]] westward [[H3220]] to [[H413]] the border [[H1366]] of the Japhletites [[H3311]] as [[H5704]] far as the border [[H1366]] of lower [[H8481]] Beth-horon, [[H1032]] then to [[H5704]] Gezer, [[H1507]] and ended [[H1961]] at the Sea. [[H3220]]

###### 4
So Ephraim [[H669]] and Manasseh, [[H4519]] the sons [[H1121]] of Joseph, [[H3130]] received their inheritance. [[H5157]]

###### 5
This was [[H1961]] the territory [[H1366]] of the descendants [[H1121]] of Ephraim [[H669]] by their clans: [[H4940]] The border [[H1366]] of their inheritance [[H5159]] went from Ataroth-addar [[H5853]] in the east [[H4217]] to Upper [[H5945]] Beth-horon [[H1032]]

###### 6
and out [[H3318]] toward the Sea. [[H3220]] From Michmethath [[H4366]] on the north [[H6828]] it [[H1366]] turned [[H5437]] eastward [[H4217]] toward Taanath-shiloh [[H8387]] and passed by [[H5674]] it [[H853]] to Janoah [[H3239]] on the east. [[H4217]]

###### 7
From Janoah [[H3239]] it went down [[H3381]] to Ataroth [[H5852]] and Naarah, [[H5292]] and then reached [[H6293]] Jericho [[H3405]] and came out [[H3318]] at the Jordan. [[H3383]]

###### 8
From Tappuah [[H8599]] the border [[H1366]] went [[H1980]] westward [[H3220]] to the Brook [[H5158]] of Kanah [[H7071]] and ended [[H1961]] at the Sea. [[H3220]] This [[H2063]] was the inheritance [[H5159]] of the clans [[H4940]] of the tribe [[H4294]] of Ephraim, [[H669]]

###### 9
[along] with all the cities [[H5892]] and villages [[H2691]] set apart [[H3995]] for the descendants [[H1121]] of Ephraim [[H669]] within [[H8432]] the inheritance [[H5159]] of Manasseh. [[H4519]]

###### 10
But they did not [[H3808]] drive out [[H3423]] the Canaanites [[H3669]] who lived [[H3427]] in Gezer. [[H1507]] So the Canaanites [[H3669]] dwell [[H3427]] among [[H7130]] the Ephraimites [[H669]] to [[H5704]] this [[H2088]] day, [[H3117]] but they are [[H1961]] forced laborers. [[H5647]]
