###### 1
Now these [are the portions] [[H428]] that [[H834]] the Israelites [[H1121]] inherited [[H5157]] in the land [[H776]] of Canaan, [[H3667]] as distributed [[H5157]] by Eleazar [[H499]] the priest, [[H3548]] Joshua [[H3091]] son [[H1121]] of Nun, [[H5126]] and the heads [[H7218]] of the families [[H1]] of the tribes [[H4294]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

###### 2
Their inheritance [[H5159]] was assigned by lot [[H1486]] for the nine [[H8672]] and a half [[H2677]] tribes, [[H4294]] as [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] had commanded [[H6680]] through [[H3027]] Moses. [[H4872]]

###### 3
For [[H3588]] Moses [[H4872]] had given [[H5414]] the inheritance [[H5159]] east of [[H5676]] the Jordan [[H3383]] to the [other] two [[H8147]] and a half [[H2677]] tribes. [[H4294]] But he granted [[H5414]] no [[H3808]] inheritance [[H5159]] among them [[H8432]] to the Levites. [[H3881]]

###### 4
The descendants [[H1121]] of Joseph [[H3130]] became [[H1961]] two [[H8147]] tribes, [[H4294]] Manasseh [[H4519]] and Ephraim. [[H669]] And no [[H3808]] portion [[H2506]] of the land [[H776]] was given [[H5414]] to the Levites, [[H3881]] except for [[H518]] cities [[H5892]] in which to live, [[H3427]] along with pasturelands [[H4054]] for their flocks [[H4735]] and herds. [[H7075]]

###### 5
So [[H3651]] the Israelites [[H1121]] did [[H6213]] as [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] had commanded [[H6680]] Moses, [[H4872]] and they divided [[H2505]] the land. [[H776]]

###### 6
Then the sons [[H1121]] of Judah [[H3063]] approached [[H5066]] Joshua [[H3091]] at Gilgal, [[H1537]] and Caleb [[H3612]] son [[H1121]] of Jephunneh [[H3312]] the Kenizzite [[H7074]] said [[H559]] to him, [[H413]] “You [[H859]] know [[H3045]] what [[H834]] the LORD [[H3069]] said [[H1696]] to [[H413]] Moses [[H4872]] the man [[H376]] of God [[H430]] at Kadesh-barnea [[H6947]] about [[H5921]] you and me. [[H182]]

###### 7
I [was] [[H595]] forty [[H705]] years old [[H1121]] when Moses [[H4872]] the servant [[H5650]] of the LORD [[H3068]] sent [[H7971]] me [[H853]] from  Kadesh-barnea [[H6947]] to spy out [[H7270]] the land, [[H776]] and I brought back [[H7725]] to him [[H853]] an honest [[H834]] report. [[H1697]]

###### 8
Although my brothers [[H251]] who [[H834]] went [[H5927]] with me [[H5973]] {made} the hearts [[H3820]] of the people [[H5971]] melt with fear, [[H4529]] I [[H595]] remained loyal [[H4390]] to [[H310]] the LORD [[H3068]] my God. [[H430]]

###### 9
On that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] Moses [[H4872]] swore to me, [[H7650]] saying, [[H559]] ‘Surely [[H3808]] the land [[H776]] on which [[H834]] you have set foot [[H1869]] will be [[H1961]] an inheritance [[H5159]] to you  and your children [[H1121]] forever, [[H5704]] because [[H3588]] you have wholly [[H4390]] followed [[H310]] the LORD [[H3068]] my God.’ [[H430]]

###### 10
Now [[H6258]] behold, [[H2009]] as [[H834]] [the LORD] promised, [[H1696]] [He] [[H3068]] has kept me alive [[H2421]] these [[H2088]] forty-five [[H705]] years [[H8141]] since [[H227]] [He] [[H3068]] spoke [[H1696]] this [[H2088]] word [[H1697]] to [[H413]] Moses, [[H4872]] while [[H834]] Israel [[H3478]] wandered [[H1980]] in the wilderness. [[H4057]] So [[H6258]] here [[H2009]] I am today, [[H595]] eighty-five [[H2568]] years old, [[H1121]]

###### 11
still [[H5750]] as strong [[H2389]] today [[H3117]] as [[H834]] I was the day [[H3117]] Moses [[H4872]] sent me out. [[H7971]] As my strength [[H3581]] was then, [[H227]] so [it] [[H3581]] is now [[H6258]] for war, [[H4421]] for going out, [[H3318]] and for coming in. [[H935]]

###### 12
Now therefore [[H6258]] give [[H5414]] me  this [[H2088]] hill country [[H2022]] that [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] promised [[H1696]] me on that [[H1931]] day, [[H3117]] for [[H3588]] you yourself [[H859]] heard [[H8085]] then [[H3117]] that [[H3588]] the Anakim [[H6062]] were there, [[H8033]] with great [[H1419]] [and] fortified [[H1219]] cities. [[H5892]] Perhaps [[H194]] with the LORD's [[H3068]] help [[H854]] I will drive them out, [[H3423]] as [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] has spoken. [[H1696]]

###### 13
Then Joshua [[H3091]] blessed [[H1288]] Caleb [[H3612]] son [[H1121]] of Jephunneh [[H3312]] and gave [[H5414]] him Hebron [[H2275]] as his inheritance. [[H5159]]

###### 14
Therefore [[H5921]] Hebron [[H2275]] belongs to [[H1961]] Caleb [[H3612]] son [[H1121]] of Jephunneh [[H3312]] the Kenizzite [[H7074]] as an inheritance [[H5159]] to [[H5704]] this [[H2088]] day, [[H3117]] because [[H3282]] he wholly [[H4390]] followed [[H310]] the LORD, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

###### 15
(Hebron [[H2275]] used to be [[H6440]] called [[H8034]] Kiriath-arba, [[H7153]] after Arba, [[H1931]] the greatest [[H1419]] man [[H120]] among the Anakim.) [[H6062]] Then the land [[H776]] had rest [[H8252]] from war. [[H4421]]
