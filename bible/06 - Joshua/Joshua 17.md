### 1
Now this was [[H1961]] the allotment [[H1486]] for the tribe [[H4294]] of Manasseh [[H4519]] as Joseph’s [[H3130]] firstborn son, [[H1060]] [namely] for Machir [[H4353]] the firstborn [[H1060]] of Manasseh [[H4519]] and father [[H1]] of the Gileadites, [[H1568]] who had received [[H1961]] Gilead [[H1568]] and Bashan [[H1316]] because [[H3588]] [Machir] [[H1931]] was [[H1961]] a man [[H376]] of war. [[H4421]]

### 2
So this allotment was [[H1961]] for the rest [[H3498]] of the descendants [[H1121]] of Manasseh— [[H4519]] the clans [[H1121]] of Abiezer, [[H44]] Helek, [[H2507]] Asriel, [[H844]] Shechem, [[H7928]] Hepher, [[H2660]] and Shemida. [[H8061]] These [[H428]] are the other male [[H2145]] descendants [[H1121]] of the clans [[H4940]] of Manasseh [[H4519]] son [[H1121]] of Joseph. [[H3130]]

### 3
But Zelophehad [[H6765]] son [[H1121]] of Hepher [[H2660]] (the son [[H1121]] of Gilead, [[H1568]] the son [[H1121]] of Machir, [[H4353]] the son [[H1121]] of Manasseh) [[H4519]] had [[H1961]] no [[H3808]] sons [[H1121]] but [[H3588]] only [[H518]] daughters. [[H1323]] These [[H428]] are the names [[H8034]] of his daughters: [[H1323]] Mahlah, [[H4244]] Noah, [[H5270]] Hoglah, [[H2295]] Milcah, [[H4435]] and Tirzah. [[H8656]]

### 4
They approached [[H7126]] Eleazar [[H499]] the priest, [[H3548]] Joshua [[H3091]] son [[H1121]] of Nun, [[H5126]] and the leaders, [[H5387]] and said, [[H559]] “The LORD [[H3069]] commanded [[H6680]] Moses [[H4872]] to give [[H5414]] us an inheritance [[H5159]] among [[H8432]] our brothers.” [[H251]] So [Joshua] gave [[H5414]] them  an inheritance [[H5159]] among [[H8432]] their father's [[H1]] brothers, [[H251]] in keeping with [[H413]] the command of [[H6310]] the LORD. [[H3069]]

### 5
Thus ten [[H6235]] shares [[H2256]] fell [[H5307]] to Manasseh, [[H4519]] in addition to [[H905]] the land [[H776]] of Gilead [[H1568]] and Bashan [[H1316]] beyond [[H5676]] the Jordan, [[H3383]]

### 6
because [[H3588]] the daughters [[H1323]] of Manasseh [[H4519]] received [[H5157]] an inheritance [[H5159]] among [[H8432]] his sons. [[H1121]] And the land [[H776]] of Gilead [[H1568]] belonged to [[H1961]] the rest [[H3498]] of the sons [[H1121]] of Manasseh. [[H4519]]

### 7
Now the border [[H1366]] of Manasseh [[H4519]] went [[H1961]] from Asher [[H836]] to Michmethath [[H4366]] near [[H5921]] Shechem, [[H7927]] then [[H1980]] southward [[H413]] to include [[H413]] the inhabitants [[H3427]] of En-tappuah. [[H5887]]

### 8
The region [[H776]] of Tappuah [[H8599]] belonged to [[H1961]] Manasseh, [[H4519]] but Tappuah itself, [[H8599]] on [[H413]] the border [[H1366]] of Manasseh, [[H4519]] belonged to [[H1121]] Ephraim. [[H669]]

### 9
From there the border [[H1366]] continued [[H3381]] southward [[H5045]] to the Brook [[H5158]] of Kanah. [[H7071]] There were cities [[H5892]] belonging to Ephraim [[H669]] among [[H8432]] the cities [[H5892]] of Manasseh, [[H4519]] but the border [[H1366]] of Manasseh [[H4519]] [was] on the north side [[H6828]] of the brook [[H5158]] and ended [[H1961]] at the Sea. [[H3220]]

### 10
Ephraim’s [territory] [[H669]] was to the south, [[H5045]] and Manasseh’s [[H4519]] was [[H1961]] to the north, [[H6828]] having the Sea [[H3220]] as its border [[H1366]] and adjoining [[H6293]] Asher [[H836]] on the north [[H6828]] and Issachar [[H3485]] on the east. [[H4217]]

### 11
Within Issachar [[H3485]] and Asher, [[H836]] Manasseh [[H4519]] was assigned [[H1961]] Beth-shean, [[H1052]] Ibleam, [[H2991]] Dor [[H1756]] (that is, [[H7969]] Naphath), [[H5316]] Endor, [[H5874]] Taanach, [[H8590]] [and] [[H3427]] Megiddo, [[H4023]] each with their surrounding settlements. [[H1323]]

### 12
But the descendants [[H1121]] of Manasseh [[H4519]] were unable [[H3201]] to occupy [[H3423]] these [[H428]] cities, [[H5892]] because the Canaanites [[H3669]] were determined [[H2974]] to stay [[H3427]] in this [[H2063]] land. [[H776]]

### 13
However, [[H1961]] when [[H3588]] the Israelites [[H1121]] grew stronger, [[H2388]] they put [[H5414]] the Canaanites [[H3669]] to forced labor; [[H4522]] but they failed [[H3808]] to drive them out [[H3423]] completely. [[H3423]]

### 14
Then the sons [[H1121]] of Joseph [[H3130]] said [[H1696]] to [[H854]] Joshua, [[H3091]] “Why [[H4069]] have you given [[H5414]] us  [only] [[H259]] one [[H259]] portion [[H1486]] as an inheritance? [[H5159]] We [[H589]] have many [[H7227]] people, [[H5971]] because [[H5704]] the LORD [[H3068]] has blessed us abundantly.” [[H1288]]

### 15
Joshua [[H3091]] answered [[H559]] them, [[H413]] “If [[H518]] you [[H859]] have so many [[H7227]] people [[H5971]] that [[H3588]] the hill country [[H2022]] of Ephraim [[H669]] is too small [[H213]] for you,  go [[H5927]] to  the forest [[H3293]] and clear [[H1254]] for yourself  an area [[H8033]] in the land [[H776]] of the Perizzites [[H6522]] and the Rephaim. [[H7497]]

### 16
“The hill country [[H2022]] is not [[H3808]] enough [[H4672]] for us,”  [they] [[H1121]] replied, [[H559]] “and all [[H3605]] the Canaanites [[H3669]] who live [[H3427]] in the valley [[H6010]] have iron [[H1270]] chariots, [[H7393]] both in Beth-shean [[H1052]] with its towns [[H1323]] and in the valley [[H6010]] of Jezreel.” [[H3157]]

### 17
So Joshua [[H3091]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] the house [[H1004]] of Joseph— [[H3130]] to Ephraim [[H669]] and Manasseh— [[H4519]] “You have many [[H7227]] people [[H5971]] and great [[H1419]] strength. [[H3581]] You shall not [[H3808]] have [[H1961]] just one [[H259]] allotment, [[H1486]]

### 18
because [[H3588]] the hill country [[H2022]] will be [[H1961]] yours as well.  It [[H1931]] is a forest; [[H3293]] clear it, [[H1254]] and its farthest limits [[H8444]] will be [[H1961]] yours.  Although [[H3588]] [the Canaanites] have iron [[H1270]] chariots, [[H7393]] and although [[H3588]] they are strong, [[H2389]] you can [[H1931]] drive them out.” [[H3423]]
