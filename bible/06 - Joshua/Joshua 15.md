###### 1
Now the allotment [[H1486]] for the clans [[H4940]] of the tribe [[H4294]] of Judah [[H3063]] extended [[H1961]] to [[H413]] the border [[H1366]] of Edom, [[H123]] to the Wilderness [[H4057]] of Zin [[H6790]] at the extreme [[H7097]] southern boundary: [[H8486]]

###### 2
Their [[H1992]] southern [[H5045]] border [[H1366]] started [[H1961]] at the bay [[H3956]] on [[H4480]] the southern [[H5045]] tip [[H7097]] of the Salt Sea, [[H3220]]

###### 3
proceeded [[H3318]] to the south [[H5045]] of the Ascent  of Akrabbim, [[H4610]] continued on [[H5674]] to Zin, [[H6790]] went over [[H5927]] to the south [[H5045]] of Kadesh-barnea, [[H6947]] ran past [[H5674]] Hezron [[H2696]] up to [[H5927]] Addar, [[H146]] and curved [[H5437]] toward Karka. [[H7173]]

###### 4
It proceeded [[H5674]] to Azmon, [[H6111]] joined the Brook [[H5158]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] and ended [[H8444]] at the Sea. [[H3220]] This [[H2088]] was [[H1961]] their  southern [[H5045]] border. [[H1366]]

###### 5
The eastern [[H6924]] border [[H1366]] was the Salt Sea [[H3220]] as far as [[H5704]] the mouth [[H7097]] of the Jordan. [[H3383]] The northern [[H6828]] border [started] [[H1366]] from the bay [[H3956]] of the sea [[H3220]] at the mouth [[H7097]] of the Jordan, [[H3383]]

###### 6
went up [[H5927]] to Beth-hoglah, [[H1031]] proceeded [[H5674]] north [[H6828]] of  Beth-arabah, [[H1026]] and went up [[H5927]] to the Stone [[H68]] of Bohan [[H932]] son [[H1121]] of Reuben. [[H7205]]

###### 7
Then [the border] [[H1366]] went up [[H5927]] to Debir [[H1688]] from the Valley [[H6010]] of Achor, [[H5911]] turning [[H6437]] north [[H6828]] to [[H413]] Gilgal, [[H1537]] which [[H834]] faces [[H5227]] the Ascent [[H4608]] of Adummim [[H131]] south [[H5045]] of the ravine. [[H5158]] [It] [[H1366]] continued [[H5674]] along [[H413]] the waters [[H4325]] of En-shemesh [[H5885]] and came out [[H1961]] at [[H413]] En-rogel. [[H5883]]

###### 8
From there the border [[H1366]] went up [[H5927]] the Valley of Hinnom [[H1516]] along [[H413]] the southern [[H5045]] slope [[H3802]] of the Jebusites [[H2983]] (that is, [[H1931]] Jerusalem) [[H3389]] and ascended [[H5927]] to [[H413]] the top [[H7218]] of the hill [[H2022]] that [[H834]] faces [[H5921]] the Valley of Hinnom [[H1516]] on the west, [[H3220]] at the northern [[H6828]] end [[H7097]] of the Valley [[H6010]] of the Rephaim. [[H7497]]

###### 9
From the hilltop [[H7218]] the border [[H1366]] curved [[H8388]] to [[H413]] the spring [[H4599]] of the Waters [[H4325]] of Nephtoah, [[H5318]] proceeded [[H3318]] to [[H413]] the cities [[H5892]] of Mount [[H2022]] Ephron, [[H6085]] and then bent around [[H8388]] toward Baalah [[H1173]] (that is, [[H1931]] Kiriath-jearim). [[H7157]]

###### 10
The border [[H1366]] curled [[H5437]] westward [[H3220]] from Baalah [[H1173]] to [[H413]] Mount [[H2022]] Seir, [[H8165]] ran [[H5674]] along [[H413]] the northern [[H6828]] slope [[H3802]] of Mount [[H2022]] Jearim [[H3297]] (that is, [[H1931]] Chesalon), [[H3693]] went down [[H3381]] to Beth-shemesh, [[H1053]] and crossed [[H5674]] to Timnah. [[H8553]]

###### 11
Then [it] [[H1366]] went out [[H3318]] to [[H413]] the northern [[H6828]] slope [[H3802]] of Ekron, [[H6138]] curved [[H8388]] toward Shikkeron, [[H7942]] proceeded [[H5674]] to Mount [[H2022]] Baalah, [[H1173]] went on [[H3318]] to Jabneel, [[H2995]] and ended [[H1961]] at the Sea. [[H3220]]

###### 12
And the western [[H3220]] border [[H1366]] was the coastline [[H1366]] of the Great [[H1419]] Sea. [[H3220]] These [[H2088]] are the boundaries [[H1366]] around [[H5439]] the clans [[H4940]] of the descendants [[H1121]] of Judah. [[H3063]]

###### 13
According [[H413]] to the LORD’s [[H3068]] command [[H6310]] to [him], [[H3091]] [Joshua] gave [[H5414]] Caleb [[H3612]] son [[H1121]] of Jephunneh [[H3312]] a portion [[H2506]] among [[H8432]] the sons [[H1121]] of Judah— [[H3063]] Kiriath-arba, [[H7153]] that [is], [[H1931]] Hebron. [[H2275]] (Arba was the forefather [[H1]] of Anak.) [[H6061]]

###### 14
And Caleb [[H3612]] drove out [[H3423]] from there [[H8033]] the three [[H7969]] sons [[H1121]] of Anak— [[H6061]] the descendants of [[H853]] Sheshai, [[H8344]] Ahiman, [[H289]] and Talmai, [[H8526]] the children [[H3211]] of Anak. [[H6061]]

###### 15
From there [[H8033]] he marched [[H5927]] against [[H413]] the inhabitants [[H3427]] of Debir [[H1688]] (formerly [[H6440]] known as [[H8034]] Kiriath-sepher). [[H7158]]

###### 16
And Caleb [[H3612]] said, [[H559]] “I will give [[H5414]] my daughter [[H1323]] Acsah [[H5915]] in marriage [[H802]] to the one who [[H834]] strikes down [[H5221]] and captures [[H3920]] Kiriath-sepher.” [[H7158]]

###### 17
So Othniel [[H6274]] son [[H1121]] of Caleb’s [[H3612]] brother [[H251]] Kenaz [[H7073]] took it, [[H3920]] and Caleb gave [[H5414]] his daughter [[H1323]] Acsah [[H5915]] to him  in marriage. [[H802]]

###### 18
Later, [[H1961]] [Acsah] came [to Othniel] [[H935]] and urged him [[H5496]] to ask [[H7592]] her father [[H1]] for [[H853]] a field. [[H7704]] When she got off [[H6795]] her donkey, [[H2543]] Caleb [[H3612]] asked her, [[H559]] “What [[H4100]] would you like?” 

###### 19
“Give [[H5414]] me  a blessing,” [[H1293]] she replied. [[H559]] “Since [[H3588]] you have given [[H5414]] me land [[H776]] in the Negev, [[H5045]] give [[H5414]] me also  springs [[H1543]] of water.” [[H4325]] So [Caleb] gave [[H5414]] her  the upper [[H5942]] and lower [[H8482]] springs. [[H1543]]

###### 20
This [[H2063]] is the inheritance [[H5159]] of the clans [[H4940]] of the tribe [[H4294]] of Judah. [[H3063]]

###### 21
These were [[H1961]] the southernmost [[H7097]] cities [[H5892]] of the tribe [[H4294]] of Judah [[H3063]] in the Negev [[H5045]] toward [[H413]] the border [[H1366]] of Edom: [[H123]] Kabzeel, [[H6909]] Eder, [[H5740]] Jagur, [[H3017]]
