### 1
Now when [[H1961]] Jabin [[H2985]] king [[H4428]] of Hazor [[H2674]] heard of this, [[H8085]] he sent word [[H7971]] to [[H413]] Jobab [[H3103]] king [[H4428]] of Madon, [[H4068]] to [[H413]] the kings [[H4428]] of Shimron [[H8110]] and Achshaph, [[H407]]

### 2
to [[H413]] the kings [[H4428]] of the north [[H6828]] in the mountains, [[H2022]] in the Arabah [[H6160]] south [[H5045]] of Chinnereth, [[H3672]] in the foothills, [[H8219]] and on the slopes [[H5299]] of Dor [[H1756]] to the west, [[H3220]]

### 3
to the Canaanites [[H3669]] in the east [[H4217]] and west, [[H3220]] to the Amorites, [[H567]] Hittites, [[H2850]] Perizzites, [[H6522]] and Jebusites [[H2983]] in the hill country, [[H2022]] and to the Hivites [[H2340]] at the foot of [[H8478]] Hermon [[H2768]] in the land [[H776]] of Mizpah. [[H4709]]

### 4
So [these kings] [[H1992]] came out [[H3318]] with [[H5973]] all [[H3605]] their armies, [[H4264]] a multitude [[H5971]] as numerous [[H7227]] as the sand [[H2344]] on [[H5921]] the seashore, [[H8193]] along with a great number [[H7227]] of horses [[H5483]] and chariots. [[H7393]]

### 5
All [[H3605]] these [[H428]] kings [[H4428]] joined forces [[H3259]] and encamped [[H2583]] at [[H413]] the waters [[H4325]] of Merom [[H4792]] to fight [[H3898]] against [[H5973]] Israel. [[H3478]]

### 6
The LORD [[H3068]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Joshua, [[H3091]] “Do not [[H408]] be afraid [[H3372]] of them, [[H6440]] for [[H3588]] by this [[H2063]] time [[H6256]] tomorrow [[H4279]] I [[H595]] will deliver [[H5414]] all of them [[H3605]] slain [[H2491]] before [[H6440]] Israel. [[H3478]] You shall hamstring [[H6131]] their horses [[H5483]] and burn up [[H8313]] their chariots. [[H4818]]

### 7
So by [[H5921]] the waters [[H4325]] of Merom [[H4792]] Joshua [[H3091]] and his whole [[H3605]] army [[H4421]] came [[H935]] upon them [[H5921]] suddenly [[H6597]] and attacked them, [[H5307]]

### 8
and the LORD [[H3068]] delivered [[H5414]] them into the hand [[H3027]] of Israel, [[H3478]] who struck them down [[H5221]] and pursued them [[H7291]] all the way to [[H5704]] Greater [[H7227]] Sidon [[H6721]] and Misrephoth-maim, [[H4956]] and eastward [[H4217]] as far as [[H5704]] the Valley [[H1237]] of Mizpeh. [[H4708]] They struck them down, [[H5221]] leaving [[H7604]] no [[H1115]] survivors. [[H8300]]

### 9
Joshua [[H3091]] treated [[H6213]] them as [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] had told him; [[H559]] he hamstrung [[H6131]] their horses [[H5483]] and burned up [[H8313]] their chariots. [[H4818]]

### 10
At that [[H1931]] time [[H6256]] Joshua [[H3091]] turned back [[H7725]] and captured [[H3920]] Hazor [[H2674]] and struck down [[H5221]] its king [[H4428]] with the sword, [[H2719]] because [[H3588]] Hazor [[H2674]] was [[H1931]] formerly [[H6440]] the head [[H7218]] of all [[H3605]] these [[H428]] kingdoms. [[H4467]]

### 11
[The Israelites] struck down [[H5221]] everyone [[H3605]] in [Hazor]  with the sword, [[H2719]] utterly destroying [them]. [[H2763]] Nothing [[H3808]] that breathed [[H5397]] remained, [[H3498]] and [[H853]] [Joshua] burned down [[H8313]] Hazor itself. [[H2674]]

### 12
Joshua [[H3091]] captured [[H3920]] all [[H3605]] these [[H428]] kings [[H4428]] and their cities [[H5892]] and struck them down [[H5221]] with the sword. [[H2719]] He utterly destroyed [[H2763]] them, [[H853]] as [[H834]] Moses [[H4872]] the LORD’s [[H3068]] servant [[H5650]] had commanded. [[H6680]]

### 13
Yet [[H7535]] Israel [[H3478]] did not [[H3808]] burn [[H8313]] any [[H3605]] of the cities [[H5892]] built [[H5975]] on [[H5921]] their mounds, [[H8510]] except [[H2108]] Hazor, [[H2674]] which Joshua [[H3091]] burned. [[H8313]]

### 14
The Israelites [[H1121]] took for themselves [[H962]] all [[H3605]] the plunder [[H7998]] and livestock [[H929]] of these [[H428]] cities, [[H5892]] but [[H7535]] they struck down [[H5221]] all [[H3605]] the people [[H120]] with the sword [[H2719]] until [[H5704]] they had completely destroyed them, [[H8045]] not sparing anyone [[H7604]] who breathed. [[H5314]]

### 15
As [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] had commanded [[H6680]] His servant [[H5650]] Moses, [[H4872]] so Moses [[H4872]] commanded [[H6680]] Joshua. [[H3091]] That is what [[H3651]] Joshua [[H3091]] did, [[H6213]] leaving nothing [[H3808]] undone [[H5493]] of all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] had commanded [[H6680]] Moses. [[H4872]]

### 16
So Joshua [[H3091]] took [[H3947]] this [[H2063]] entire [[H3605]] region: [[H776]] the hill country, [[H2022]] all [[H3605]] the Negev, [[H5045]] all [[H3605]] the land [[H776]] of Goshen, [[H1657]] the western foothills, [[H8219]] the Arabah, [[H6160]] and the mountains [[H2022]] of Israel [[H3478]] and their foothills, [[H8219]]

### 17
from [[H4480]] Mount [[H2022]] Halak, [[H2510]] which rises [[H5927]] toward Seir, [[H8165]] as [[H5704]] far as Baal-gad [[H1171]] in the Valley [[H1237]] of Lebanon [[H3844]] at the foot of [[H8478]] Mount [[H2022]] Hermon. [[H2768]] He captured [[H3920]] all [[H3605]] their kings [[H4428]] and struck them down, [[H5221]] putting them to death. [[H4191]]

### 18
Joshua [[H3091]] waged [[H6213]] war [[H4421]] against all [[H3605]] these [[H428]] kings [[H4428]] for a long period [[H7227]] of time. [[H3117]]

### 19
No [[H3808]] city [[H5892]] made peace [[H7999]] with [[H413]] the Israelites [[H1121]] except [[H1115]] the Hivites [[H2340]] living [[H3427]] in Gibeon; [[H1391]] all [[H3605]] others were taken [[H3947]] in battle. [[H4421]]

### 20
For [[H3588]] it was [[H1961]] of [[H853]] the LORD [[H3068]] to harden [[H2388]] their hearts [[H3820]] to engage [[H7125]] Israel [[H3478]] in battle, [[H4421]] that they would be completely destroyed [[H2763]] without [[H1115]] mercy [[H8467]] and [[H3588]] be annihilated [[H8045]] as [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] had commanded [[H6680]] Moses. [[H4872]]

### 21
At that [[H1931]] time [[H6256]] Joshua [[H3091]] proceeded [[H935]] to eliminate [[H3772]] the Anakim [[H6062]] from [[H4480]] the hill country [[H2022]] of Hebron, [[H2275]] Debir, [[H1688]] [and] Anab, [[H6024]] and from all [[H3605]] the hill country [[H2022]] of Judah [[H3063]] and of Israel. [[H3478]] Joshua [[H3091]] completely destroyed [[H2763]] them with [[H5973]] their cities. [[H5892]]

### 22
No [[H3808]] Anakim [[H6062]] were left [[H3498]] in the land [[H776]] of the Israelites; [[H1121]] only [[H7535]] in Gaza, [[H5804]] Gath, [[H1661]] and Ashdod [[H795]] did any survive. [[H7604]]

### 23
So Joshua [[H3091]] took [[H3947]] the entire [[H3605]] land, [[H776]] in keeping with all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] had spoken [[H1696]] to Moses. [[H4872]] And Joshua [[H3091]] gave [[H5414]] it as an inheritance [[H5159]] to Israel [[H3478]] according to the allotments [[H4256]] to their tribes. [[H7626]] Then the land [[H776]] had rest [[H8252]] from war. [[H4421]]
