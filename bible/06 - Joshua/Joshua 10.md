### 1
Now [[H1961]] Adoni-zedek [[H139]] king [[H4428]] of Jerusalem [[H3389]] heard [[H8085]] that [[H3588]] Joshua [[H3091]] had captured [[H3920]] Ai [[H5857]] and completely destroyed it, [[H2763]] doing to [[H6213]] Ai [[H5857]] and its king [[H4428]] as [[H834]] he had done to [[H6213]] Jericho [[H3405]] and its king, [[H4428]] and that [[H3588]] the people [[H3427]] of Gibeon [[H1391]] had made peace [[H7999]] with [[H854]] Israel [[H3478]] and were [[H1961]] living among them. [[H7130]]

### 2
So [Adoni-zedek and his people] were greatly [[H3966]] alarmed, [[H3372]] because [[H3588]] Gibeon [[H1391]] [was] a great [[H1419]] city, [[H5892]] like one [[H259]] of the royal [[H4467]] cities; [[H5892]] it [[H1931]] was larger [[H1419]] than [[H4480]] Ai, [[H5857]] and all [[H3605]] its men [[H376]] were warriors. [[H1368]]

### 3
Therefore Adoni-zedek [[H139]] king [[H4428]] of Jerusalem [[H3389]] sent [[H7971]] word to [[H413]] Hoham [[H1944]] king [[H4428]] of Hebron, [[H2275]] Piram [[H6502]] king [[H4428]] of Jarmuth, [[H3412]] Japhia [[H3309]] king [[H4428]] of Lachish, [[H3923]] and Debir [[H1688]] king [[H4428]] of Eglon, [[H5700]] saying, [[H559]]

### 4
“Come up [[H5927]] and help me. [[H5826]] We will attack [[H5221]] Gibeon, [[H1391]] because [[H3588]] they have made peace [[H7999]] with [[H854]] Joshua [[H3091]] and the Israelites.” [[H1121]]

### 5
So the five [[H2568]] kings [[H4428]] of the Amorites— [[H567]] the kings [[H4428]] of Jerusalem, [[H3389]] Hebron, [[H2275]] Jarmuth, [[H3412]] Lachish, [[H3923]] and Eglon— [[H5700]] joined forces [[H622]] and advanced [[H5927]] with all [[H3605]] their armies. [[H4264]] They camped [[H2583]] before [[H5921]] Gibeon [[H1391]] and made war [[H3898]] against it. [[H5921]]

### 6
Then the men [[H376]] of Gibeon [[H1391]] sent [[H7971]] word to [[H413]] Joshua [[H3091]] in [[H413]] the camp [[H4264]] at Gilgal: [[H1537]] “Do not [[H408]] abandon [[H7503]] your servants. [[H5650]] Come [[H5927]] quickly [[H4120]] and save us! [[H3467]] Help us, [[H5826]] because [[H3588]] all [[H3605]] the kings [[H4428]] of the Amorites [[H567]] from [[H3427]] the hill country [[H2022]] have joined forces [[H6908]] against us. [[H413]]

### 7
So Joshua [[H3091]] and his whole [[H3605]] army, [[H4421]] including all [[H3605]] the mighty warriors, [[H1368]] came [[H5927]] from [[H4480]] Gilgal. [[H1537]]

### 8
The LORD [[H3068]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Joshua, [[H3091]] “Do not [[H408]] be afraid [[H3372]] of them, [[H1992]] for [[H3588]] I have given them [[H5414]] into your hands. [[H3027]] Not [[H3808]] one [[H376]] of them [[H1992]] shall stand [[H5975]] against you.” [[H6440]]

### 9
After marching [[H5927]] all [[H3605]] night [[H3915]] from [[H4480]] Gilgal, [[H1537]] Joshua [[H3091]] caught [[H935]] them by surprise. [[H6597]]

### 10
The LORD [[H3068]] threw them into confusion [[H2000]] before [[H6440]] Israel, [[H3478]] who defeated [[H5221]] them in a great [[H1419]] slaughter [[H4347]] at Gibeon, [[H1391]] pursued [[H7291]] them through [[H1870]] the ascent [[H4609]] to Beth-horon, [[H1032]] and struck them down [[H5221]] as [[H5704]] far as Azekah [[H5825]] and Makkedah. [[H4719]]

### 11
As they fled [[H5127]] before [[H4480]] Israel [[H3478]] along the descent [[H4174]] from Beth-horon [[H1032]] to [[H5704]] Azekah, [[H5825]] the LORD [[H3068]] cast down [[H7993]] on them [[H5921]] large [[H1419]] hailstones [[H68]] from the sky, [[H8064]] and more [[H7227]] of them [[H834]] were killed [[H4191]] by [[H68]] the hailstones [[H1259]] than [[H834]] by the swords [[H2719]] of the Israelites. [[H3478]]

### 12
On the day [[H3117]] the LORD [[H3068]] gave the Amorites [[H567]] over [[H5414]] to [[H6440]] the Israelites, [[H1121]] Joshua [[H3091]] spoke [[H1696]] to the LORD [[H3068]] in the presence [[H5869]] of Israel: [[H3478]] “O sun, [[H8121]] stand still [[H1826]] over Gibeon, [[H1391]] O moon, [[H3394]] over the Valley [[H6010]] of Aijalon.” [[H357]]

### 13
So the sun [[H8121]] stood still [[H1826]] and the moon [[H3394]] stopped [[H5975]] until [[H5704]] the nation [[H1471]] took vengeance [[H5358]] upon its enemies. [[H341]] Is this [[H1931]] not [[H3808]] written [[H3789]] in [[H5921]] the Book [[H5612]] of Jashar? [[H3477]] “So the sun [[H8121]] stopped [[H5975]] in the middle [[H2677]] of the sky [[H8064]] and delayed [[H3808]] going down [[H935]] almost a full [[H8549]] day. [[H3117]]

### 14
There has been [[H1961]] no [[H3808]] day [[H3117]] like it before [[H6440]] or since, [[H310]] when the LORD [[H3068]] listened [[H8085]] to the voice [[H6963]] of a man, [[H376]] because [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] fought [[H3898]] for Israel. [[H3478]]

### 15
Then Joshua [[H3091]] returned [[H7725]] with all [[H3605]] Israel [[H3478]] to [[H413]] the camp [[H4264]] at Gilgal. [[H1537]]

### 16
Now the [[H428]] five [[H2568]] kings [[H4428]] had fled [[H5127]] and hidden [[H2244]] in the cave [[H4631]] at Makkedah. [[H4719]]

### 17
And Joshua [[H3091]] was informed: [[H5046]] “The five [[H2568]] kings [[H4428]] have been found; [[H4672]] they are hiding [[H2244]] in the cave [[H4631]] at Makkedah.” [[H4719]]

### 18
So Joshua [[H3091]] said, [[H559]] “Roll [[H1556]] large [[H1419]] stones [[H68]] against [[H413]] the mouth [[H6310]] of the cave, [[H4631]] and post [[H6485]] men [[H582]] there [[H5921]] to guard them. [[H8104]]

### 19
But you, [[H859]] do not [[H408]] stop there. [[H5975]] Pursue [[H7291]] your enemies [[H341]] and attack them from behind. [[H2179]] Do not [[H408]] let them [[H5414]] reach [[H935]] their cities, [[H5892]] for [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] has delivered them [[H5414]] into your hand.” [[H3027]]

### 20
So Joshua [[H3091]] and the Israelites [[H1121]] finished [[H3615]] inflicting [[H5221]] a terrible [[H1419]] slaughter [[H4347]] until [[H5704]] they had finished them off, [[H8552]] and the remaining [[H8300]] survivors [[H8277]] retreated [[H935]] to [[H413]] the fortified [[H4013]] cities. [[H5892]]

### 21
The whole [[H3605]] army [[H5971]] returned [[H7725]] safely [[H7965]] to [[H413]] Joshua [[H3091]] in [[H413]] the camp [[H4264]] at Makkedah; [[H4719]] no one [[H3808]] dared to utter [[H2782]] a word [[H3956]] against [[H376]] the Israelites. [[H3478]]

### 22
Then Joshua [[H3091]] said, [[H559]] “Open [[H6605]] the mouth [[H6310]] of the cave, [[H4631]] and bring those [[H428]] five [[H2568]] kings [[H4428]] out [[H4480]] to [[H413]] me.” [[H3318]]

### 23
So [[H3651]] [they] [[H6213]] brought [[H3318]] the [[H428]] five [[H2568]] kings [[H4428]] out of [[H4480]] the cave— [[H4631]] the kings [[H4428]] of Jerusalem, [[H3389]] Hebron, [[H2275]] Jarmuth, [[H3412]] Lachish, [[H3923]] and Eglon. [[H5700]]

### 24
When they had brought [[H3318]] the [[H428]] kings [[H4428]] to [[H413]] Joshua, [[H3091]] [he] [[H3091]] summoned [[H7121]] all [[H3605]] the men [[H376]] of Israel [[H3478]] and said [[H559]] to [[H413]] the army [[H4421]] commanders [[H7101]] who had accompanied [[H1980]] him, [[H854]] “Come [[H7126]] here and put [[H7760]] your feet [[H7272]] on [[H5921]] the necks [[H6677]] of these [[H428]] kings. [[H4428]] So the commanders came forward [[H7126]] and put [[H7760]] their feet [[H7272]] on [[H5921]] their necks. [[H6677]]

### 25
“Do not [[H408]] be afraid [[H3372]] or discouraged,” [[H2865]] Joshua [[H3091]] said. [[H559]] “Be strong [[H2388]] and courageous, [[H553]] for [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] will do [[H6213]] this [[H3602]] to all [[H3605]] the enemies [[H341]] you [[H859]] fight.” [[H3898]]

### 26
After [[H310]] this, [[H3651]] Joshua [[H3091]] struck down [[H5221]] and killed [the kings], [[H4191]] and he hung [[H8518]] their bodies on [[H5921]] five [[H2568]] trees [[H6086]] and left them [[H1961]] there [[H5921]] until [[H5704]] evening. [[H6153]]

### 27
At sunset [[H935]] Joshua [[H3091]] ordered [[H6680]] that they be taken down [[H3381]] from [[H5921]] the trees [[H6086]] and thrown [[H7993]] into [[H413]] the cave [[H4631]] in which [[H834]] they had hidden. [[H2244]] Then large [[H1419]] stones [[H68]] were placed [[H7760]] against [[H5921]] the mouth [[H6310]] of the cave, [[H4631]] and the stones [[H5704]] are there to this [[H2088]] day. [[H3117]]

### 28
On that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] Joshua [[H3091]] captured [[H3920]] Makkedah [[H4719]] and struck it down [[H5221]] with the sword, [[H2719]] along with [[H853]] its king. [[H4428]] He completely destroyed [[H2763]] it [[H853]] and everyone [[H3605]] in it, [[H5315]] leaving [[H7604]] no [[H3808]] survivors. [[H8300]] So he did [[H6213]] to the king [[H4428]] of Makkedah [[H4719]] as [[H834]] he had done [[H6213]] to the king [[H4428]] of Jericho. [[H3405]]

### 29
Then Joshua [[H3091]] and all [[H3605]] Israel [[H3478]] with him [[H5973]] moved on [[H5674]] from Makkedah [[H4719]] to Libnah [[H3841]] and fought [[H3898]] against [[H5973]] Libnah. [[H3841]]

### 30
And the LORD [[H3068]] also [[H1571]] delivered [[H5414]] [that city] [[H853]] and its king [[H4428]] into the hands [[H3027]] of Israel, [[H3478]] and [[H853]] [Joshua] struck down [[H5221]] all [[H3605]] the people [[H5315]] with the sword, [[H2719]] leaving [[H7604]] no [[H3808]] survivors. [[H8300]] And he did [[H6213]] to the king [of Libnah] [[H4428]] as [[H834]] he had done [[H6213]] to the king [[H4428]] of Jericho. [[H3405]]

### 31
And Joshua [[H3091]] and all [[H3605]] Israel [[H3478]] with him [[H5973]] moved on [[H5674]] from Libnah [[H3841]] to Lachish. [[H3923]] They laid siege [[H2583]] to it [[H5921]] and fought [[H3898]] against it. 

### 32
And the LORD [[H3068]] delivered [[H5414]] Lachish [[H3923]] into the hands [[H3027]] of Israel, [[H3478]] and Joshua captured [[H3920]] it on the second [[H8145]] day. [[H3117]] He struck down [[H5221]] all [[H3605]] the people [[H5315]] with the sword, [[H2719]] just as [[H3605]] he had done [[H6213]] to Libnah. [[H3841]]

### 33
At that time [[H227]] Horam [[H2036]] king [[H4428]] of Gezer [[H1507]] went [[H5927]] to help [[H5826]] Lachish, [[H3923]] but Joshua [[H3091]] struck him down [[H5221]] along with his people, [[H5971]] leaving [[H7604]] no [[H1115]] survivors. [[H8300]]

### 34
So Joshua [[H3091]] moved on [[H5674]] from Lachish [[H3923]] to Eglon, [[H5700]] and all [[H3605]] Israel [[H3478]] with him. [[H5973]] They laid siege [[H2583]] to it [[H5921]] and fought [[H3898]] against it. [[H5921]]

### 35
That same [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] they captured [Eglon] [[H3920]] and struck down [[H5221]] all [[H3605]] the people [[H5315]] with the sword. [[H2719]] [Joshua] completely destroyed [[H2763]] it that [[H1931]] day, [[H3117]] just as [[H3605]] he had done [[H6213]] to Lachish. [[H3923]]

### 36
Then Joshua [[H3091]] and all [[H3605]] Israel [[H3478]] with him [[H5973]] went up [[H5927]] from Eglon [[H5700]] to Hebron [[H2275]] and fought [[H3898]] against it. [[H5921]]

### 37
They captured it [[H3920]] and struck down [[H5221]] with the sword [[H2719]] its king, [[H4428]] all [[H3605]] its villages, [[H5892]] and [[H853]] all [[H3605]] the people. [[H5315]] [Joshua] left [[H7604]] no [[H3808]] survivors, [[H8300]] just as [[H3605]] he had done [[H6213]] at Eglon; [[H5700]] he completely destroyed [[H2763]] [Hebron] [[H853]] and everyone [[H3605]] in it. 

### 38
Finally Joshua [[H3091]] and all [[H3605]] Israel [[H3478]] with him [[H5973]] turned [[H7725]] toward Debir [[H1688]] and fought [[H3898]] against it. [[H5921]]

### 39
And they captured [the city] [[H3920]] and [[H853]] its king [[H4428]] and [[H853]] all [[H3605]] its villages. [[H5892]] They struck them down [[H5221]] with the sword [[H2719]] and completely destroyed [[H2763]] all [[H3605]] the people, [[H5315]] leaving [[H7604]] no [[H3808]] survivors. [[H8300]] [Joshua] did to [[H6213]] Debir [[H1688]] and its king [[H4428]] as [[H834]] he had done [[H6213]] to Hebron [[H2275]] and as [[H3651]] he had done [[H6213]] to Libnah [[H3841]] and its king. [[H4428]]

### 40
So Joshua [[H3091]] conquered [[H5221]] the whole [[H3605]] region— [[H776]] the hill country, [[H2022]] the Negev, [[H5045]] the foothills, [[H8219]] and the slopes, [[H794]] together with [[H853]] all [[H3605]] their kings— [[H4428]] leaving [[H7604]] no [[H3808]] survivors. [[H8300]] He completely destroyed [[H2763]] all [[H3605]] that breathed, [[H5397]] just as [[H834]] the LORD, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] had commanded. [[H6680]]

### 41
Joshua [[H3091]] conquered the area [[H5221]] from  Kadesh-barnea [[H6947]] to [[H5704]] Gaza, [[H5804]] and the whole [[H3605]] region [[H776]] of Goshen [[H1657]] as far as [[H5704]] Gibeon. [[H1391]]

### 42
And because [[H3588]] the LORD, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] fought [[H3898]] for Israel, [[H3478]] Joshua [[H3091]] captured [[H3920]] all [[H3605]] these [[H428]] kings [[H4428]] and their land [[H776]] in one [[H259]] campaign. [[H6471]]

### 43
Then Joshua [[H3091]] returned [[H7725]] with [[H5973]] all [[H3605]] Israel [[H3478]] to [[H413]] the camp [[H4264]] at Gilgal. [[H1537]]
