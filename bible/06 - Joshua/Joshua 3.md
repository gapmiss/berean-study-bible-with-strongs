###### 1
Early the next morning [[H1242]] Joshua [[H3091]] got up [[H7925]] and left [[H5265]] Acacia Grove [[H7851]] with all [[H3605]] the Israelites. [[H1121]] They went [[H935]] as [[H5704]] far as the Jordan, [[H3383]] where they camped [[H3885]] before [[H2962]] crossing over. [[H5674]]

###### 2
After [[H7097]] three [[H7969]] days [[H3117]] the officers [[H7860]] went [[H5674]] through [[H7130]] the camp [[H4264]]

###### 3
and commanded [[H6680]] the people: [[H5971]] “When you see [[H7200]] the ark [[H727]] of the covenant [[H1285]] of the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] being carried [[H5375]] by the Levitical [[H3881]] priests, [[H3548]] you [[H859]] are to set out [[H5265]] from your positions [[H4725]] and follow [[H1980]] it. [[H310]]

###### 4
But [[H389]] keep a distance [[H7350]] of about two thousand [[H505]] cubits [[H520]] between yourselves [[H996]] and the ark.  Do not [[H408]] go near it, [[H7126]] so that [[H4616]] you can see [[H3045]] the way [[H1870]] to go, [[H1980]] since [[H3588]] you have never [[H3808]] traveled [[H5674]] this way [[H1870]] before.” [[H8543]]

###### 5
Then Joshua [[H3091]] told [[H559]] the people, [[H5971]] “Consecrate yourselves, [[H6942]] for [[H3588]] tomorrow [[H4279]] the LORD [[H3068]] will do [[H6213]] wonders [[H6381]] among you.” [[H7130]]

###### 6
And [he] [[H3091]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] the priests, [[H3548]] “Take [[H5375]] the ark [[H727]] of the covenant [[H1285]] and go on [[H5674]] ahead of [[H6440]] the people.” [[H5971]] So they carried [[H5375]] the ark [[H727]] of the covenant [[H1285]] and went [[H1980]] ahead [[H6440]] of them. [[H5971]]

###### 7
Now the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Joshua, [[H3091]] “Today [[H3117]] I will begin [[H2490]] to exalt you [[H1431]] in the sight [[H5869]] of all [[H3605]] Israel, [[H3478]] so [[H834]] they may know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I am [[H1961]] with you, [[H5973]] just as [[H834]] I was [[H1961]] with [[H5973]] Moses. [[H4872]]

###### 8
Command [[H6680]] the priests [[H3548]] carrying [[H5375]] the ark [[H727]] of the covenant: [[H1285]] ‘When you reach [[H935]] the edge [[H7097]] of the waters, [[H4325]] stand [[H5975]] in the Jordan.’” [[H3383]]

###### 9
So Joshua [[H3091]] told [[H559]] the Israelites, [[H1121]] “Come [[H5066]] here [[H2008]] and listen [[H8085]] to the words [[H1697]] of the LORD [[H3068]] your God.” [[H430]]

###### 10
He [[H3091]] continued, [[H559]] “This is how [[H2063]] you will know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] the living [[H2416]] God [is] [[H410]] among you [[H7130]] and that He will surely drive out [[H3423]] before you [[H6440]] the Canaanites, [[H3669]] Hittites, [[H2850]] Hivites, [[H2340]] Perizzites, [[H6522]] Girgashites, [[H1622]] Amorites, [[H567]] and Jebusites. [[H2983]]

###### 11
Behold, [[H2009]] the ark [[H727]] of the covenant [[H1285]] of the Lord [[H136]] of all [[H3605]] the earth [[H776]] will go [[H5674]] ahead of you [[H6440]] into the Jordan. [[H3383]]

###### 12
Now [[H6258]] choose [[H3947]] twelve [[H8147]] men [[H376]] from the tribes [[H7626]] of Israel, [[H3478]] one [[H259]] from each tribe. [[H7626]]

###### 13
When the feet [[H3709]] of the priests [[H3548]] who carry [[H5375]] the ark [[H727]] of the LORD— [[H3068]] the Lord [[H136]] of all [[H3605]] the earth— [[H776]] touch down [[H5117]] in the waters [[H4325]] of the Jordan, [[H3383]] its [[H3383]] flowing [[H3381]] waters [[H4325]] will be cut off [[H3772]] [and] [[H4325]] stand up [[H5975]] in a [[H259]] heap.” [[H5067]]

###### 14
So [[H1961]] when the people [[H5971]] broke camp [[H5265]] to cross [[H5674]] the Jordan, [[H3383]] the priests [[H3548]] carried [[H5375]] the ark [[H727]] of the covenant [[H1285]] ahead of [[H6440]] [them]. [[H5971]]

###### 15
Now the Jordan [[H3383]] overflows [[H4390]] its banks [[H1415]] throughout [[H3605]] the harvest [[H7105]] season. [[H3117]] But as soon as the priests [[H3548]] carrying [[H5375]] the ark [[H727]] reached [[H935]] the Jordan [[H3383]] [and] their feet [[H7272]] touched [[H2881]] the water's [[H4325]] edge, [[H7097]]

###### 16
the flowing [[H3381]] water [[H4325]] stood still. [[H5975]] It backed up [[H6965]] as far upstream [[H7368]] as Adam, [[H121]] a city [[H5892]] in the area [[H6654]] of Zarethan, [[H6891]] while the water flowing [[H3381]] toward [[H5921]] the Sea [[H3220]] of the Arabah [[H6160]] (the Salt Sea) [[H3220]] was completely [[H8552]] cut off. [[H3772]] So the people [[H5971]] crossed over [[H5674]] opposite [[H5048]] Jericho. [[H3405]]

###### 17
The priests [[H3548]] carrying [[H5375]] the ark [[H727]] of the covenant [[H1285]] of the LORD [[H3068]] stood [[H5975]] firm [[H3559]] on dry ground [[H2724]] in the middle [[H8432]] of the Jordan, [[H3383]] while all [[H3605]] Israel [[H3478]] crossed over [[H5674]] the dry ground, [[H2724]] until [[H5704]] the entire [[H3605]] nation [[H1471]] had crossed [[H5674]] the Jordan.
