###### 1
Then the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Joshua, [[H3091]] “Do not [[H408]] be afraid [[H3372]] or discouraged. [[H2865]] Take [[H3947]] the whole [[H3605]] army [[H4421]] with you, [[H5973]] and go up [[H6965]] and attack [[H5927]] Ai. [[H5857]] See, [[H7200]] I have handed over to you [[H5414]] the king [[H4428]] of Ai, [[H5857]] his people, [[H5971]] his city, [[H5892]] and [[H853]] his land. [[H776]]

###### 2
And you shall do [[H6213]] to Ai [[H5857]] and its king [[H4428]] as [[H834]] you did [[H6213]] to Jericho [[H3405]] and its king, [[H4428]] except that [[H7535]] you may carry off [[H962]] their plunder [[H7998]] and livestock [[H929]] for yourselves.  Set [[H7760]] an ambush [[H693]] behind [[H310]] the city.” [[H5892]]

###### 3
So Joshua [[H3091]] and the whole [[H3605]] army [[H4421]] set out [[H6965]] to attack [[H5927]] Ai. [[H5857]] Joshua [[H3091]] chose [[H977]] 30,000 [[H7970]] valiant [[H2428]] warriors [[H1368]] and sent them out [[H7971]] at night [[H3915]]

###### 4
with these orders: [[H6680]] “Pay attention. [[H7200]] You [[H859]] are to lie in ambush [[H693]] behind [[H4480]] the city, [[H5892]] not [[H408]] too [[H3966]] far [[H7368]] from it. [[H5892]] All of you [[H3605]] must be [[H1961]] ready. [[H3559]]

###### 5
Then I [[H589]] and all [[H3605]] the troops [[H5971]] with me [[H854]] will advance [[H7126]] on the city. [[H5892]] When [[H3588]] they come out [[H3318]] against us [[H7125]] as [[H834]] they did the first time, [[H7223]] we will flee [[H5127]] from them. [[H6440]]

###### 6
They will pursue [[H3318]] us until [[H5704]] we have drawn them away [[H5423]] from [[H4480]] the city, [[H5892]] for [[H3588]] they will say, [[H559]] ‘[The Israelites] are running away [[H5127]] from us [[H6440]] as they did before.’ [[H834]] So as we flee [[H5127]] from them, [[H6440]]

###### 7
you [[H859]] are to rise [[H6965]] from the ambush [[H693]] and seize [[H3423]] the city, [[H5892]] for the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] will deliver it [[H5414]] into your hands. [[H3027]]

###### 8
After you have taken [[H8610]] the city, [[H5892]] set it [[H5892]] on fire. [[H3341]] Do [[H6213]] as the LORD [[H3068]] has commanded! [[H1697]] See, [[H7200]] I have given you orders.” [[H6680]]

###### 9
So Joshua [[H3091]] sent them out, [[H7971]] and they went [[H1980]] to [[H413]] the place of ambush [[H3993]] and lay in wait [[H3427]] between [[H996]] Bethel [[H1008]] and Ai, [[H5857]] to the west [[H3220]] of Ai. [[H5857]] But [Joshua] [[H3091]] spent [[H3885]] that [[H1931]] night [[H3915]] among [[H8432]] the people. [[H5971]]

###### 10
Joshua [[H3091]] rose early [[H7925]] the next morning [[H1242]] and mobilized [[H6485]] [his men], [[H5971]] and he [[H1931]] and the elders [[H2205]] of Israel [[H3478]] marched [[H5927]] before [[H6440]] [them] [[H5971]] up to Ai. [[H5857]]

###### 11
Then all [[H3605]] the troops [[H5971]] who [were] [[H834]] with him [[H854]] marched up [[H5927]] and approached [[H5066]] the city. [[H5892]] They arrived [[H935]] in front [of Ai] [[H5048]] and camped [[H2583]] to the north [[H6828]] of it, [[H5857]] with the valley [[H1516]] between [[H996]] them and the city. [[H5857]]

###### 12
Now Joshua had taken [[H3947]] about five [[H2568]] thousand [[H505]] men [[H376]] and set [[H7760]] them [[H853]] in ambush [[H693]] between [[H996]] Bethel [[H1008]] and Ai, [[H5857]] to the west [[H3220]] of the city. [[H5892]]

###### 13
So the forces [[H5971]] were stationed [[H7760]] with the main [[H3605]] camp [[H4264]] to the north [[H6828]] of the city [[H5892]] and the rear guard [[H6119]] to the west [[H3220]] of the city. [[H5892]] And that [[H1931]] night [[H3915]] Joshua [[H3091]] went [[H1980]] into [[H8432]] the valley. [[H6010]]

###### 14
When the king [[H4428]] of Ai [[H5857]] saw [the Israelites], [[H7200]] he hurried [[H4116]] out [[H3318]] early in the morning [[H7925]] with the men [[H582]] of the city [[H5892]] to engage [[H7125]] [them] [[H3478]] in battle [[H4421]] at an appointed place [[H4150]] overlooking [[H6440]] the Arabah. [[H6160]] But he [[H1931]] did not [[H3808]] know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] an ambush [[H693]] had been set against him  behind [[H310]] the city. [[H5892]]

###### 15
Joshua [[H3091]] and all [[H3605]] Israel [[H3478]] let themselves be beaten back [[H5060]] before them, [[H6440]] and they fled [[H5127]] toward [[H1870]] the wilderness. [[H4057]]

###### 16
Then all [[H3605]] the men [of Ai] [[H5971]] were summoned [[H2199]] to pursue them, [[H7291]] and they followed [[H7291]] Joshua [[H3091]] and were drawn away [[H5423]] from [[H4480]] the city. [[H5892]]

###### 17
Not [[H3808]] a man [[H376]] was left [[H7604]] in Ai [[H5857]] or Bethel [[H1008]] who [[H834]] did not [[H3808]] go out [[H3318]] after [[H310]] Israel, [[H3478]] leaving [[H5800]] the city [[H5892]] wide open [[H6605]] while they pursued [[H7291]] Israel. [[H3478]]

###### 18
Then the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Joshua, [[H3091]] “Hold out [[H5186]] your battle lance [[H3591]] toward [[H413]] Ai, [[H5857]] for [[H3588]] into your hand [[H3027]] I will deliver [the city].” [[H5414]] So Joshua [[H3091]] held out [[H5186]] his battle lance [[H3591]] toward [[H413]] [Ai], [[H5892]]

###### 19
and as soon as he did so, [[H5186]] the men in ambush [[H693]] rose [[H6965]] quickly [[H4120]] from their position. [[H4725]] They rushed forward, [[H7323]] entered [[H935]] the city, [[H5892]] captured it, [[H3920]] and immediately [[H4116]] set it [[H5892]] on fire. [[H3341]]

###### 20
When the men [[H376]] of Ai [[H5857]] turned [[H6437]] and looked [[H7200]] back, [[H310]] the smoke [[H6227]] of the city [[H5892]] was rising [[H5927]] to the sky. [[H8064]] They could not [[H3808]] escape [[H5127]] in any direction, [[H2008]] and the troops [[H5971]] who had fled [[H5127]] to the wilderness [[H4057]] now became the pursuers. [[H7291]]

###### 21
When Joshua [[H3091]] and all [[H3605]] Israel [[H3478]] saw [[H7200]] that [[H3588]] the men in ambush [[H693]] had captured [[H3920]] the city [[H5892]] and that [[H3588]] smoke [[H6227]] was rising from [[H5927]] [it], [[H5892]] they turned around [[H7725]] and struck down [[H5221]] the men [[H582]] of Ai. [[H5857]]

###### 22
Meanwhile, those in the ambush [[H428]] came out [[H3318]] of [[H4480]] the city [[H5892]] against them, [[H7125]] and the men of Ai were [[H1961]] trapped between [[H8432]] the Israelite [[H3478]] forces [[H428]] on [[H2088]] both sides. [[H428]] So [Israel] struck them down [[H5221]] until [[H5704]] no [[H1115]] survivor [[H8300]] or fugitive [[H6412]] remained. [[H7604]]

###### 23
But [[H853]] they took [[H8610]] the king [[H4428]] of Ai [[H5857]] alive [[H2416]] and brought [[H7126]] him to [[H413]] Joshua. [[H3091]]

###### 24
When Israel [[H3478]] had finished [[H3615]] killing [[H2026]] all [[H3605]] the men [[H3427]] of Ai [[H5857]] who had pursued [[H7291]] them  into the field [[H7704]] and wilderness, [[H4057]] and when every [[H3605]] last one of them had fallen [[H5307]] by the sword, [[H2719]] all [[H3605]] the Israelites [[H3478]] returned [[H7725]] to Ai [[H5857]] and struck it down [[H5221]] with the sword. [[H2719]]

###### 25
A total [[H3605]] of twelve [[H8147]] thousand [[H505]] men [[H376]] and [[H5704]] women [[H802]] fell [[H5307]] that [[H1931]] day— [[H3117]] all [[H3605]] the people [[H376]] of Ai. [[H5857]]

###### 26
Joshua [[H3091]] did not [[H3808]] draw back [[H7725]] his hand [[H3027]] that [[H834]] held [[H5186]] his battle lance [[H3591]] until [[H5704]] all [[H3605]] the inhabitants [[H3427]] of Ai [[H5857]] were completely destroyed. [[H2763]]

###### 27
Israel [[H3478]] took [[H962]] for themselves [[H1992]] only [[H7535]] the cattle [[H929]] and plunder [[H7998]] of that [[H1931]] city, [[H5892]] as the LORD [[H3068]] had commanded [[H6680]] Joshua. [[H3091]]

###### 28
So Joshua [[H3091]] burned [[H8313]] Ai [[H5857]] and made it [[H7760]] a permanent [[H5769]] heap of ruins, [[H8510]] a desolation [[H8077]] to [[H5704]] this [[H2088]] day. [[H3117]]

###### 29
He hung [[H8518]] the body of the king [[H4428]] of Ai [[H5857]] on [[H5921]] a tree [[H6086]] until [[H5704]] evening, [[H6153]] and at sunset [[H935]] Joshua [[H3091]] commanded [[H6680]] that they take down the body [[H5038]] from [[H4480]] the tree [[H6086]] and throw it down [[H7993]] at [[H413]] the entrance [[H6607]] of the city [[H5892]] gate. [[H8179]] And over it [[H5921]] they raised [[H6965]] a large [[H1419]] pile [[H1530]] of rocks, [[H68]] which remains to [[H5704]] this [[H2088]] day. [[H3117]]

###### 30
At that time [[H227]] Joshua [[H3091]] built [[H1129]] an altar [[H4196]] on Mount [[H2022]] Ebal [[H5858]] to the LORD, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]]

###### 31
just as [[H834]] Moses [[H4872]] the servant [[H5650]] of the LORD [[H3068]] had commanded [[H6680]] the Israelites. [[H1121]] He built it according to what is written [[H3789]] in the book [[H5612]] of the Law [[H8451]] of Moses: [[H4872]] an altar [[H4196]] of uncut [[H8003]] stones [[H68]] on [[H5921]] which [[H834]] no [[H3808]] iron tool [[H1270]] had been used. [[H5130]] And on it [[H5921]] they offered [[H5927]] burnt offerings [[H5930]] to the LORD, [[H3068]] and they sacrificed [[H2076]] peace offerings. [[H8002]]

###### 32
And there [[H8033]] in the presence [[H6440]] of the Israelites, [[H1121]] [Joshua] inscribed [[H3789]] on [[H5921]] the stones [[H68]] a copy [[H4932]] of the Law [[H8451]] of Moses, [[H4872]] which [[H834]] he had written. [[H3789]]

###### 33
All [[H3605]] Israel, [[H3478]] foreigners [[H1616]] and citizens alike, [[H249]] with their elders, [[H2205]] officers, [[H7860]] and judges, [[H8199]] stood [[H5975]] on both sides [[H2088]] of the ark [[H727]] of the covenant [[H1285]] of the LORD [[H3068]] facing [[H5048]] the Levitical [[H3881]] priests [[H3548]] who carried [[H5375]] [it]. [[H727]] Half [of the people stood] [[H2677]] in front [[H4136]] of Mount [[H2022]] Gerizim [[H1630]] and half of them [[H2677]] in front [[H4136]] of Mount [[H2022]] Ebal, [[H5858]] as [[H834]] Moses [[H4872]] the servant [[H5650]] of the LORD [[H3068]] had commanded [[H6680]] earlier [[H7223]] to bless [[H1288]] the people [[H5971]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

###### 34
Afterward, [[H310]] Joshua read aloud [[H7121]] all [[H3605]] the words [[H1697]] of the law— [[H8451]] the blessings [[H1293]] and the curses— [[H7045]] according to all [[H3605]] that is written [[H3789]] in the book [[H5612]] of the law. [[H8451]]

###### 35
There was [[H1961]] not [[H3808]] a word [[H1697]] of all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] Moses [[H4872]] had commanded [[H6680]] that [[H834]] Joshua [[H3091]] failed [[H3808]] to read [[H7121]] before [[H5048]] the whole [[H3605]] assembly [[H6951]] of Israel, [[H3478]] including the women, [[H802]] the little ones, [[H2945]] and the foreigners [[H1616]] who lived [[H1980]] among them.
