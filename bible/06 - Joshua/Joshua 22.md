###### 1
Then [[H227]] Joshua [[H3091]] summoned [[H7121]] the Reubenites, [[H7206]] the Gadites, [[H1425]] and the half-tribe [[H2677]] of Manasseh [[H4519]]

###### 2
and told them, [[H559]] “You [[H859]] have done [[H8104]] all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] Moses [[H4872]] the servant [[H5650]] of the LORD [[H3068]] commanded [[H6680]] you, [[H853]] and you have obeyed [[H8085]] my voice [[H6963]] in all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] I commanded [[H6680]] you. [[H853]]

###### 3
All this time [[H3117]] you have not [[H3808]] deserted [[H5800]] your brothers, [[H251]] up to [[H5704]] this very day, [[H3117]] but have kept [[H8104]] the charge [[H4931]] given you [[H4687]] by the LORD [[H3068]] your God. [[H430]]

###### 4
And now that [[H6258]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] has given your brothers [[H251]] rest [[H5117]] as [[H834]] He promised them, [[H1696]] you may return [[H6437]] to your homes [[H168]] in [[H413]] the land [[H776]] that [[H834]] Moses [[H4872]] the servant [[H5650]] of the LORD [[H3068]] gave [[H5414]] you  across [[H5676]] the Jordan. [[H3383]]

###### 5
But [[H7535]] be very [[H3966]] careful [[H8104]] to observe [[H6213]] the commandment [[H4687]] and [[H853]] the law [[H8451]] that [[H834]] Moses [[H4872]] the servant [[H5650]] of the LORD [[H3068]] gave you: [[H6680]] to love [[H157]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God, [[H430]] to walk [[H1980]] in all [[H3605]] His ways, [[H1870]] to keep [[H8104]] His commandments, [[H4687]] to hold fast [[H1692]] to Him,  and to serve Him [[H5647]] with all [[H3605]] your heart [[H3824]] and all [[H3605]] your soul. [[H5315]]

###### 6
So Joshua [[H3091]] blessed them [[H1288]] and sent them on their way, [[H7971]] and they went [[H1980]] to [[H413]] their homes. [[H168]]

###### 7
(To the half-tribe [[H2677]] of Manasseh [[H4519]] Moses [[H4872]] had given land [[H5414]] in Bashan, [[H1316]] and to the other half [[H2677]] Joshua [[H3091]] gave land [[H5414]] on the west [[H3220]] side [[H5676]] of the Jordan [[H3383]] among [[H5973]] their brothers.) [[H251]] When [[H3588]] Joshua [[H3091]] sent [[H7971]] them to [[H413]] their homes [[H168]] he blessed them, [[H1288]]

###### 8
saying, [[H559]] “Return [[H7725]] to [[H413]] your homes [[H168]] with your great [[H7227]] wealth, [[H5233]] with immense [[H7227]] herds of livestock, [[H4735]] with silver, [[H3701]] gold, [[H2091]] bronze, [[H5178]] iron, [[H1270]] and very many [[H7235]] clothes. [[H8008]] Divide [[H2505]] with [[H5973]] your brothers [[H251]] the spoil [[H7998]] of your enemies.” [[H341]]

###### 9
So the Reubenites, [[H1121]] the Gadites, [[H1121]] and the half-tribe [[H2677]] of Manasseh [[H4519]] left [[H1980]] the Israelites [[H1121]] at Shiloh [[H7887]] in the land [[H776]] of Canaan [[H3667]] to return [[H1980]] to [[H413]] their own land [[H776]] of Gilead, [[H1568]] which [[H834]] they had acquired [[H270]] according to [[H5921]] the command [[H6310]] of the LORD [[H3068]] through [[H3027]] Moses. [[H4872]]

###### 10
And when they came [[H935]] to [[H413]] Geliloth [[H1552]] near the Jordan [[H3383]] in the land [[H776]] of Canaan, [[H3667]] the Reubenites, [[H1121]] the Gadites, [[H1121]] and the half-tribe [[H2677]] of Manasseh [[H4519]] built [[H1129]] an imposing [[H4758]] altar [[H4196]] there [[H8033]] by [[H5921]] the Jordan. [[H3383]]

###### 11
Then the Israelites [[H1121]] received [[H8085]] the report: [[H559]] “Behold, [[H2009]] the Reubenites, [[H1121]] the Gadites, [[H1121]] and the half-tribe [[H2677]] of Manasseh [[H4519]] have built [[H1129]] an altar [[H4196]] on [[H413]] the border [[H4136]] of the land [[H776]] of Canaan, [[H3667]] at [[H413]] Geliloth [[H1552]] near the Jordan [[H3383]] on [[H413]] the Israelite [[H1121]] side.” [[H5676]]

###### 12
And when [they] [[H1121]] heard this, [[H8085]] the whole [[H3605]] congregation [[H5712]] of Israel [[H3478]] assembled [[H6950]] at Shiloh [[H7887]] to go [[H5927]] to war [[H6635]] against them. [[H5921]]

###### 13
The Israelites [[H1121]] sent [[H7971]] Phinehas [[H6372]] son of [[H1121]] Eleazar [[H499]] the priest [[H3548]] to [[H413]] the land [[H776]] of Gilead, [[H1568]] to [[H413]] the Reubenites, [[H1121]] the Gadites, [[H1410]] and the half-tribe [[H2677]] of Manasseh. [[H4519]]

###### 14
With him [[H5973]] [they sent] ten [[H6235]] chiefs— [[H5387]] one [[H259]] family [[H1004]] leader [[H5387]] from each [[H3605]] tribe [[H4294]] of Israel, [[H3478]] each [[H376]] the head [[H7218]] of a family [[H1004]] among the clans [[H505]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

###### 15
They went [[H935]] to [[H413]] the Reubenites, [[H1121]] the Gadites, [[H1121]] and the half-tribe [[H2677]] of Manasseh [[H4519]] in [[H413]] the land [[H776]] of Gilead [[H1568]] and said [[H1696]] to them, [[H854]]

###### 16
“This is what [[H3541]] the whole [[H3605]] congregation [[H5712]] of the LORD [[H3068]] says: [[H559]] ‘What [[H4100]] is this [[H2088]] breach of faith [[H4603]] you have committed [[H4603]] today [[H3117]] against the God [[H430]] of Israel [[H3478]] by turning away [[H7725]] from [[H310]] the LORD [[H3068]] and building [[H1129]] for yourselves  an altar, [[H4196]] that you might rebel [[H4775]] against the LORD [[H3068]] this day? [[H3117]]

###### 17
Was not the sin [[H5771]] of Peor [[H6465]] enough [[H4592]] for us,  from which [[H834]] we have not [[H3808]] cleansed [[H2891]] ourselves [[H4480]] to [[H5704]] this [[H2088]] day? [[H3117]] It even brought [[H1961]] a plague [[H5063]] upon the congregation [[H5712]] of the LORD. [[H3068]]

###### 18
And now, [[H3117]] would you [[H859]] turn away [[H7725]] from [[H310]] the LORD? [[H3068]] If you [[H859]] rebel [[H4775]] today [[H3117]] against the LORD, [[H3068]] tomorrow [[H4279]] He will be angry [[H7107]] with [[H413]] the whole [[H3605]] congregation [[H5712]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

###### 19
If [[H518]] indeed [[H389]] the land [[H776]] of your inheritance [[H272]] is unclean, [[H2931]] [then] cross over [[H5674]] to [[H413]] the land [[H776]] of the LORD's [[H3068]] possession, [[H272]] where [[H834]] the LORD’s [[H3068]] tabernacle [[H4908]] stands, [[H7931]] and take possession [[H270]] of it among us. [[H8432]] But do not [[H408]] rebel [[H4775]] against the LORD [[H3068]] or against us by building [[H1129]] for yourselves  an altar [[H4196]] other than [[H1107]] the altar [[H4196]] of the LORD [[H3068]] our God. [[H430]]

###### 20
Was not [[H3808]] Achan [[H5912]] son [[H1121]] of Zerah [[H2226]] unfaithful [[H4603]] regarding [[H4604]] what was set apart for destruction, [[H2764]] bringing wrath [[H7110]] upon [[H5921]] the whole [[H3605]] congregation [[H5712]] of Israel? [[H3478]] Yet it was not [[H3808]] only [[H259]] [Achan] [[H1931]] who perished [[H1478]] because of his sin!’” [[H5771]]

###### 21
Then the Reubenites, [[H1121]] the Gadites, [[H1121]] and the half-tribe [[H2677]] of Manasseh [[H4519]] answered [[H6030]] the leaders [[H7218]] of the clans [[H505]] of Israel, [[H3478]]

###### 22
“The LORD, [[H3068]] the Mighty One, [[H410]] [is] God! [[H430]] The LORD, [[H3068]] The Mighty One, [[H410]] [is] God! [[H430]] He [[H1931]] knows, [[H3045]] and may Israel [[H3478]] also know. [[H3045]] If [this] [[H518]] was in rebellion [[H4777]] or breach of faith [[H4604]] against the LORD, [[H3068]] do not [[H408]] spare us [[H3467]] today. [[H3117]]

###### 23
If we have built [[H1129]] for ourselves an altar [[H4196]] to turn away [[H7725]] from [[H310]] Him [[H3068]] and [[H518]] to offer [[H5927]] burnt offerings [[H5930]] and grain offerings [[H4503]] on it, [[H5921]] or [[H518]] to sacrifice [[H6213]] fellowship [[H8002]] offerings [[H2077]] on it, [[H5921]] may the LORD [[H3068]] Himself [[H1931]] hold us accountable. [[H1245]]

###### 24
But in fact [[H518]] we have done [[H6213]] this [[H2063]] for fear [[H1674]] that in the future [[H4279]] your descendants [[H1121]] might say [[H559]] to ours, [[H1121]] ‘What [[H4100]] have you to do  with the LORD, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of Israel? [[H3478]]

###### 25
For the LORD [[H3068]] has made [[H5414]] the Jordan [[H3383]] a border [[H1366]] between us [[H996]] and you— [[H996]] you Reubenites [[H7205]] and Gadites. [[H1410]] You have no [[H369]] share [[H2506]] in the LORD!’ [[H3068]] So your descendants [[H1121]] could cause [[H1121]] ours [[H1121]] to stop [[H7673]] fearing [[H3372]] the LORD. [[H3068]]

###### 26
That is why we said, [[H559]] ‘Let us take action [[H6213]] and build [[H1129]] an altar for ourselves, [[H4196]] but not [[H3808]] for burnt offerings [[H5930]] or sacrifices. [[H2077]]

###### 27
Rather, [[H3588]] let it be [[H1931]] a witness [[H5707]] between us [[H996]] and you [[H996]] and [[H996]] the generations [[H1755]] to come, [[H310]] that we will worship [[H5647]] the LORD [[H3068]] in His presence [[H6440]] with our burnt offerings, [[H5930]] sacrifices, [[H2077]] and peace offerings.’ [[H8002]] Then in the future, [[H4279]] your descendants [[H1121]] cannot [[H3808]] say [[H559]] to ours, [[H1121]] You have no [[H369]] share [[H2506]] in the LORD!’ [[H3068]]

###### 28
Therefore we said, [[H559]] ‘If they ever [[H3588]] say [this] [[H559]] to us [[H413]] or [[H413]] to our descendants, [[H1755]] we will answer: [[H559]] Here is [[H7200]] the copy [[H8403]] of the altar [[H4196]] of the LORD [[H3068]] that [[H834]] our fathers [[H1]] made, [[H6213]] not [[H3808]] for burnt offerings [[H5930]] or sacrifices, [[H2077]] but [[H3588]] as a witness [[H5707]] between us [[H996]] and you. [[H996]]

###### 29
Far be it from us [[H2486]] to rebel [[H4775]] against the LORD [[H3068]] and turn away [[H7725]] from [[H4480]] Him [[H3068]] today [[H3117]] by building [[H1129]] an altar [[H4196]] for burnt offerings, [[H5930]] grain offerings, [[H4503]] or sacrifices, [[H2077]] other than [[H905]] the altar [[H4196]] of the LORD [[H3068]] our God, [[H430]] which [stands] [[H834]] before [[H6440]] His tabernacle.” [[H4908]]

###### 30
When Phinehas [[H6372]] the priest [[H3548]] and the leaders [[H5387]] of the congregation— [[H5712]] the heads [[H7218]] of Israel’s [[H3478]] clans [[H505]] who [[H834]] were with him— [[H854]] heard [[H8085]] what [[H834]] the descendants [[H1121]] of Reuben, [[H7205]] Gad, [[H1410]] and Manasseh [[H4519]] had to say, [[H1696]] they were satisfied. [[H3190]]

###### 31
Phinehas [[H6372]] son [[H1121]] of Eleazar [[H499]] the priest [[H3548]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] the descendants [[H1121]] of Reuben, [[H7205]] Gad, [[H1410]] and Manasseh, [[H4519]] “Today [[H3117]] we know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] is among us, [[H8432]] because [[H834]] you have not [[H3808]] committed [[H4603]] this [[H2088]] breach of faith [[H4604]] against Him. [[H3068]] Consequently, [[H227]] you have delivered [[H5337]] the Israelites [[H1121]] from the hand [[H3027]] of the LORD. [[H3068]]

###### 32
Then Phinehas [[H6372]] son [[H1121]] of Eleazar [[H499]] the priest [[H3548]] and the leaders [[H5387]] returned [[H7725]] to [[H413]] the Israelites [[H1121]] in [[H413]] the land [[H776]] of Canaan [[H3667]] and brought back [[H7725]] a report regarding [[H1697]] the Reubenites [[H1121]] and Gadites [[H1121]] in the land [[H776]] of Gilead. [[H1568]]

###### 33
The Israelites [[H1121]] were satisfied [[H3190]] with the report, [[H1697]] and they [[H1121]] praised [[H1288]] God [[H430]] and spoke [[H559]] no [[H3808]] more about going [[H5927]] to war [[H6635]] against them [[H5921]] to destroy [[H7843]] the land [[H776]] where [[H834]] the Reubenites [[H1121]] and Gadites [[H1121]] lived. [[H3427]]

###### 34
So the Reubenites [[H1121]] and Gadites [[H1121]] named [[H7121]] the altar [Witness], [[H4196]] [saying], [[H3588]] “It [[H1931]] is a witness [[H5707]] between us [[H996]] that [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] is God.” [[H430]]
