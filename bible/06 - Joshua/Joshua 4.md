### 1
When [[H834]] the whole [[H3605]] nation [[H1471]] had finished [[H8552]] crossing [[H5674]] the Jordan, [[H3383]] the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Joshua, [[H3091]]

### 2
“Choose [[H3947]] twelve [[H8147]] men [[H376]] from among [[H4480]] the people, [[H5971]] one [[H259]] from each tribe, [[H7626]]

### 3
and command them: [[H6680]] ‘Take up [[H5375]] for yourselves  twelve [[H8147]] stones [[H68]] from [[H2088]] the middle [[H8432]] of the Jordan [[H3383]] where the priests [[H3548]] were standing, [[H3559]] carry [[H5674]] them with you, [[H5973]] and set them down [[H3240]] in the place [[H4411]] where [[H834]] you spend [[H3885]] the night.’” [[H3915]]

### 4
So Joshua [[H3091]] summoned [[H7121]] the twelve [[H8147]] men [[H376]] he had appointed [[H3559]] from the Israelites, [[H1121]] one [[H259]] from [each] tribe, [[H7626]]

### 5
and said to them, [[H559]] “Cross over [[H5674]] before [[H6440]] the ark [[H727]] of the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] into [[H413]] the middle [[H8432]] of the Jordan. [[H3383]] Each [[H376]] of you is to take [[H7311]] a [[H259]] stone [[H68]] upon [[H5921]] his shoulder, [[H7926]] according to the number [[H4557]] of the tribes [[H7626]] of Israel, [[H3478]]

### 6
to [[H4616]] serve as [[H1961]] a sign [[H226]] among you. [[H7130]] In the future, [[H4279]] when [[H3588]] your children [[H1121]] ask, [[H7592]] ‘What [[H4100]] do these [[H428]] stones [[H68]] mean to you?’ 

### 7
you are to tell [[H559]] them,  ‘The waters [[H4325]] of the Jordan [[H3383]] were cut off [[H3772]] before [[H6440]] the ark [[H727]] of the covenant [[H1285]] of the LORD. [[H3068]] When it crossed [[H5674]] the Jordan, [[H3383]] [its] [[H3383]] waters [[H4325]] were cut off.’ [[H3772]] Therefore these [[H428]] stones [[H68]] will be [[H1961]] a memorial [[H2146]] to the Israelites [[H1121]] forever. [[H5769]]

### 8
Thus the Israelites [[H1121]] did [[H6213]] as [[H834]] Joshua [[H3091]] had commanded them. [[H6680]] They took up [[H5375]] twelve [[H8147]] stones [[H68]] from the middle [[H8432]] of the Jordan, [[H3383]] one for each [[H4557]] tribe [[H7626]] of Israel, [[H3478]] just as [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] had told [[H1696]] Joshua; [[H3091]] and they carried [[H5674]] them [[H5973]] to [[H413]] the camp, [[H4411]] where they set them down. [[H3240]]

### 9
Joshua also [[H3091]] set up [[H6965]] twelve [[H8147]] stones [[H68]] in the middle [[H8432]] of the Jordan, [[H3383]] in the place [[H8478]] where the priests [[H3548]] who carried [[H5375]] the ark [[H727]] of the covenant [[H1285]] were standing. [[H4673]] And [the stones] are [[H1961]] there [[H8033]] to [[H5704]] this [[H2088]] day. [[H3117]]

### 10
Now the priests [[H3548]] who carried [[H5375]] the ark [[H727]] remained standing [[H5975]] in the middle [[H8432]] of the Jordan [[H3383]] until [[H5704]] the people [[H5971]] had completed [[H8552]] everything [[H3605]] the LORD [[H3068]] had commanded [[H6680]] Joshua [[H3091]] to tell [[H1696]] them, [[H413]] just as [[H3605]] Moses [[H4872]] had directed [[H6680]] Joshua. [[H3091]] The people [[H5971]] hurried [[H4116]] across, [[H5674]]

### 11
and after [[H834]] everyone [[H3605]] had finished [[H8552]] crossing, [[H5674]] the priests [[H3548]] with the ark [[H727]] of the LORD [[H3068]] crossed [[H5674]] in the sight of [[H6440]] the people. [[H5971]]

### 12
The Reubenites, [[H1121]] the Gadites, [[H1121]] and the half-tribe [[H2677]] of Manasseh [[H4519]] crossed over [[H5674]] before [[H6440]] the Israelites, [[H1121]] armed for battle [[H2571]] as [[H834]] Moses [[H4872]] had instructed them. [[H1696]]

### 13
About 40,000 [[H705]] troops armed [[H2502]] for battle [[H4421]] crossed over [[H5674]] before [[H6440]] the LORD [[H3068]] into [[H413]] the plains [[H6160]] of Jericho. [[H3405]]

### 14
On that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] the LORD [[H3068]] exalted [[H1431]] Joshua [[H3091]] in the sight [[H5869]] of all [[H3605]] Israel, [[H3478]] and they revered [[H3372]] him [[H853]] all [[H3605]] the days [[H3117]] of his life, [[H2416]] just as [[H834]] they had revered [[H3372]] Moses. [[H4872]]

### 15
Then the LORD [[H3068]] said to [[H559]] Joshua, [[H3091]]

### 16
“Command [[H6680]] the priests [[H3548]] who carry [[H5375]] the ark [[H727]] of the Testimony [[H5715]] to come up [[H5927]] from [[H4480]] the Jordan.” [[H3383]]

### 17
So Joshua [[H3091]] commanded [[H6680]] the priests, [[H3548]] “Come up [[H5927]] from [[H4480]] the Jordan.” [[H3383]]

### 18
When the priests [[H3548]] carrying [[H5375]] the ark [[H727]] of the covenant [[H1285]] of the LORD [[H3068]] came up [[H5927]] out [[H8432]] of the Jordan [[H3383]] and their [[H3548]] feet [[H3709]] touched [[H5423]] the dry land, [[H2724]] the waters [[H4325]] of the Jordan [[H3383]] returned [[H7725]] to their course [[H4725]] and overflowed [[H1980]] all [[H3605]] the banks [[H1415]] as before. [[H8543]]

### 19
On the tenth [[H6218]] day of the first [[H7223]] month [[H2320]] the people [[H5971]] went up [[H5927]] from [[H4480]] the Jordan [[H3383]] and camped [[H2583]] at Gilgal [[H1537]] on the eastern [[H4217]] border [[H7097]] of Jericho. [[H3405]]

### 20
And [[H853]] there at Gilgal [[H1537]] Joshua [[H3091]] set up [[H6965]] the [[H428]] twelve [[H8147]] stones [[H68]] they had taken [[H3947]] from [[H4480]] the Jordan. [[H3383]]

### 21
Then [Joshua] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] the Israelites, [[H1121]] “In the future, [[H4279]] when [[H834]] your children [[H1121]] ask [[H7592]] their fathers, [[H1]] ‘What [[H4100]] is the meaning of these [[H428]] stones?’ [[H68]]

### 22
you are to tell [[H3045]] [them], [[H1121]] ‘Israel [[H3478]] crossed [[H5674]] the [[H2088]] Jordan [[H3383]] on dry ground.’ [[H3004]]

### 23
For [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] dried up [[H3001]] the waters [[H4325]] of the Jordan [[H3383]] before you [[H6440]] until [[H5704]] you had crossed over, [[H5674]] just as [[H834]] [He] [[H3068]] did [[H6213]] to the Red [[H5488]] Sea, [[H3220]] which [[H834]] He dried up [[H3001]] before us [[H6440]] until [[H5704]] we had crossed over. [[H5674]]

### 24
{He did this] so that [[H4616]] all [[H3605]] the peoples [[H5971]] of the earth [[H776]] may know [[H1847]] that [[H3588]] the hand [[H3027]] of the LORD [[H3068]] is mighty, [[H2389]] and so that [[H4616]] you may always [[H3605]] fear [[H3372]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God.” [[H430]]
