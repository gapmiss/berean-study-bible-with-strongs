###### 1
Now Joshua [[H3091]] was old [[H2204]] [and] advanced [[H935]] in years, [[H3117]] and the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H559]] to him, [[H413]] “You [[H859]] have become old [[H2204]] [and] advanced [[H935]] in years, [[H3117]] but very much [[H7235]] of the land [[H776]] remains [[H7604]] to be possessed. [[H3423]]

###### 2
This [[H2063]] is the land [[H776]] that remains: [[H7604]] All [[H3605]] the territory [[H1552]] of the Philistines [[H6430]] and the Geshurites, [[H1651]]

###### 3
from [[H4480]] the Shihor [[H7883]] east [[H5921]] of Egypt [[H4714]] to [[H5704]] the territory [[H1366]] of Ekron [[H6138]] on the north [[H6828]] (considered [[H2803]] to be Canaanite [territory])— [[H3669]] that of the five [[H2568]] Philistine [[H6430]] rulers [[H5633]] of Gaza, [[H5841]] Ashdod, [[H796]] Ashkelon, [[H832]] Gath, [[H1663]] and Ekron, [[H6139]] as well as the Avvites; [[H5757]]

###### 4
to the south, [[H8486]] all [[H3605]] the land [[H776]] of the Canaanites, [[H3669]] from Mearah [[H4632]] of [[H834]] the Sidonians [[H6722]] to [[H5704]] Aphek, [[H663]] as far as [[H5704]] the border [[H1366]] of the Amorites; [[H567]]

###### 6
All [[H3605]] the inhabitants [[H3427]] of the hill country [[H2022]] from [[H4480]] Lebanon [[H3844]] to [[H5704]] Misrephoth-maim— [[H4956]] all [[H3605]] the Sidonians— [[H6722]] I Myself [[H595]] will drive out [[H3423]] before [[H6440]] the Israelites. [[H1121]] Be sure to [[H7535]] divide it by lot [[H5307]] as an inheritance [[H5159]] to Israel, [[H3478]] as [[H834]] I have commanded you. [[H6680]]

###### 7
Now therefore [[H6258]] divide [[H2505]] this [[H2063]] land [[H776]] as an inheritance [[H5159]] to the nine [[H8672]] tribes [[H7626]] and the half-tribe [[H2677]] of Manasseh.” [[H4519]]

###### 8
The other [half of Manasseh], [[H5973]] along with the Reubenites [[H7206]] and Gadites, [[H1425]] had received [[H3947]] the inheritance [[H5159]] Moses [[H4872]] had given [[H5414]] them  beyond [[H5676]] the Jordan [[H3383]] to the east, [[H4217]] just as [[H834]] Moses [[H4872]] the servant [[H5650]] of the LORD [[H3068]] had assigned [[H5414]] to them: 

###### 9
[The area] from Aroer [[H6177]] on [[H5921]] the rim [[H8193]] of the Arnon [[H769]] Valley, [[H5158]] along with the city [[H5892]] in the middle [[H8432]] of the valley, [[H5158]] the whole [[H3605]] plateau [[H4334]] of Medeba [[H4311]] as [[H5704]] far as Dibon, [[H1769]]

[[H7497]] Moses [[H4872]] struck them down [[H5221]] and dispossessed them, [[H3423]]

###### 13
but the Israelites [[H1121]] did not [[H3808]] drive out [[H3423]] the Geshurites [[H1651]] or [[H853]] the Maacathites. [[H4602]] So Geshur [[H1650]] and Maacath [[H4601]] dwell [[H3427]] among [[H7130]] the Israelites [[H3478]] to [[H5704]] this [[H2088]] day. [[H3117]]

###### 14
To the tribe [[H7626]] of Levi, [[H3878]] however, [[H7535]] [Moses] had given [[H5414]] no [[H3808]] inheritance. [[H5159]] The offerings made by fire [[H801]] to the LORD, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] are [[H1931]] their inheritance, [[H5159]] as [[H834]] He promised [[H1696]] them.
