###### 1
What, [[G5101]] then, [[G3767]] [is] the [[G3588]] advantage [[G4053]] of [[G3588]] [being] a Jew? [[G2453]] Or [[G2228]] what [is] [[G5101]] the [[G3588]] value [[G5622]] of circumcision? [[G4061]]

###### 2
Much [[G4183]] in [[G2596]] every [[G3956]] way. [[G5158]] First of all, [[G4412]] they have been entrusted with [[G4100]] the [[G3588]] very words [[G3051]] of God. [[G2316]]

###### 3
What [[G5101]] if [[G1487]] some [[G5100]] did not have faith? [[G569]] {Will} their [[G846]] lack of faith [[G570]] nullify [[G2673]] God’s [[G2316]] faithfulness? [[G4102]]

###### 4
Absolutely not! [[G1096]] {Let} God [[G2316]] be [[G1096]] TRUE [[G227]] and [[G1161]] every [[G3956]] man [[G444]] a liar. [[G5583]] As [[G2531]] it is written: [[G1125]] “So that [[G302]] You may be justified [[G1344]] in [[G1722]] Your [[G4771]] words, [[G3056]] and [[G2532]] prevail [[G3528]] in [[G1722]] Your [[G4771]] judgments.” [[G2919]]

###### 5
But [[G1161]] if [[G1487]] our [[G1473]] unrighteousness [[G93]] highlights [[G4921]] the righteousness [[G1343]] of God, [[G2316]] what [[G5101]] shall we say? [[G2046]] [That] [[G3588]] God [[G2316]] [is] [[G3361]] unjust [[G94]] to inflict [[G2018]] [His] [[G3588]] wrath [on us]? [[G3709]] I am speaking [[G3004]] in [[G2596]] human terms. [[G444]]

###### 6
Absolutely not! [[G1096]] In that case, [[G1893]] how [[G4459]] {could} God [[G2316]] judge [[G2919]] the [[G3588]] world? [[G2889]]

###### 7
However, [[G1161]] if [[G1487]] my [[G1699]] falsehood [[G5582]] accentuates [[G4052]] God’s [[G2316]] truthfulness, [[G225]] to the increase [[G1519]] of His [[G846]] glory, [[G1391]] why [[G5101]] {am} I [[G2504]] still [[G2089]] condemned [[G2919]] as [[G5613]] a sinner? [[G268]]

###### 8
[Why] [[G2532]] not [say], [[G3361]] as [[G2531]] some [[G5100]] slanderously [[G987]] claim [that] [[G5346]] we [[G1473]] say, [[G3004]] “Let us do [[G4160]] evil [[G2556]] that [[G2443]] good [[G18]] may result?” [[G2064]] Their [[G3739]] condemnation [[G2917]] is [[G1510]] deserved! [[G1738]]

###### 9
What [[G5101]] then? [[G3767]] Are we any better? [[G4284]] Not [[G3756]] at all. [[G3843]] For [[G1063]] we have already made the charge [[G4256]] [that] Jews [[G2453]] and [[G2532]] Greeks [[G1672]] alike [[G5037]] are [[G1510]] all [[G3956]] under [[G5259]] sin. [[G266]]

###### 10
As [[G2531]] it is written: [[G1125]] “There is [[G1510]] no one [[G3756]] righteous, [[G1342]] not even [[G3761]] one. [[G1520]]

###### 11
There is [[G1510]] no one [[G3756]] who [[G3588]] understands, [[G4920]] no one [[G3756]] who [[G3588]] seeks [[G1567]] God. [[G2316]]

###### 12
All [[G3956]] have turned away; [[G1578]] they have together become worthless; [[G889]] there is [[G1510]] no one [[G3756]] who [[G3588]] does [[G4160]] good, [[G5544]] not [[G3756]] even [[G2193]] one. [[G1520]]

###### 13
Their [[G846]] throats [are] [[G2995]] open [[G455]] graves; [[G5028]] their [[G846]] tongues [[G1100]] practice deceit. [[G1387]] [The] venom [[G2447]] of vipers [[G785]] [is] on [[G5259]] their [[G846]] lips. [[G5491]]

###### 14
[Their] [[G3739]] mouths [[G4750]] are full [[G1073]] of cursing [[G685]] and [[G2532]] of bitterness. [[G4088]]

###### 15
Their [[G846]] feet [are] [[G4228]] swift [[G3691]] to shed [[G1632]] blood; [[G129]]

###### 16
ruin [[G4938]] and [[G2532]] misery [[G5004]] [lie] in [[G1722]] their [[G846]] wake; [[G3598]]

###### 17
and [[G2532]] [the] way [[G3598]] of peace [[G1515]] they have not known. [[G1097]]

###### 18
There is [[G1510]] no [[G3756]] fear [[G5401]] of God [[G2316]] before [[G561]] their [[G846]] eyes.” [[G3788]]

###### 19
Now [[G1161]] we know [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] whatever [[G3745]] the [[G3588]] Law [[G3551]] says, [[G3004]] it says [[G2980]] to those who are [[G3588]] under [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] Law, [[G3551]] so that [[G2443]] every [[G3956]] mouth [[G4750]] may be silenced [[G5420]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] whole [[G3956]] world [[G2889]] held accountable [[G5267]] to God. [[G2316]]

###### 20
Therefore [[G1360]] no [[G3756]] one [[G3956]] will be justified [[G1344]] in His sight [[G1799]] by [[G1537]] works [[G2041]] of the Law. [[G3551]] For [[G1063]] [the] Law [[G3551]] merely brings [[G1223]] awareness [[G1922]] of sin. [[G266]]

###### 21
But [[G1161]] now, [[G3570]] apart from [[G5565]] [the] Law, [[G3551]] [the] righteousness [[G1343]] of God [[G2316]] has been revealed, [[G5319]] as attested [[G3140]] by [[G5259]] the [[G3588]] Law [[G3551]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] Prophets. [[G4396]]

###### 22
And [[G1161]] [this] righteousness [[G1343]] [from] God [[G2316]] [comes] through [[G1223]] faith [[G4102]] in Jesus [[G2424]] Christ [[G5547]] to [[G1519]] all [[G3956]] who [[G3588]] believe. [[G4100]] There is [[G1510]] no [[G3756]] distinction, [[G1293]]

###### 23
for [[G1063]] all [[G3956]] have sinned [[G264]] and [[G2532]] fall short [[G5302]] of the [[G3588]] glory [[G1391]] of God, [[G2316]]

###### 24
[and are] justified [[G1344]] freely [[G1432]] by [[G3588]] His [[G846]] grace [[G5485]] through [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] redemption [[G629]] that [[G3588]] [is] in [[G1722]] Christ [[G5547]] Jesus. [[G2424]]

###### 25
God [[G2316]] presented [[G4388]] [Him] [[G3739]] [as an] atoning sacrifice [[G2435]] through [[G1223]] faith [[G4102]] in [[G1722]] His [[G846]] blood, [[G129]] in order [[G1519]] to demonstrate [[G1732]] His [[G846]] righteousness, [[G1343]] because [[G1223]] in [[G1722]] [His] [[G3588]] forbearance [[G463]] [He] had passed over [[G3929]] the [[G3588]] sins [[G265]] committed beforehand. [[G4266]]

###### 26
[He did this] [[G4314]] to demonstrate [[G1732]] His [[G846]] righteousness [[G1343]] at [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] present [[G3568]] time, [[G2540]] so as [[G1519]] to be [[G1510]] just [[G1342]] and [[G2532]] to justify [[G1344]] the [one] [[G3588]] [who has] [[G1537]] faith [[G4102]] in Jesus. [[G2424]]

###### 27
Where, [[G4226]] then, [is] [[G3767]] boasting? [[G2746]] It is excluded. [[G1576]] On [[G1223]] what [[G4169]] principle? [[G3551]] [On] that [[G3588]] of works? [[G2041]] No, [[G3780]] but [[G235]] on [[G1223]] [that] [[G3551]] of faith. [[G4102]]

###### 28
For [[G1063]] we maintain that [[G3049]] a man [[G444]] is justified [[G1344]] by faith [[G4102]] apart from [[G5565]] works [[G2041]] of the Law. [[G3551]]

###### 29
[Is God] the [[G3588]] God [[G2316]] of Jews [[G2453]] only? [[G3440]] [Is He] not [[G3780]] [the God] of Gentiles [[G1484]] too? [[G2532]] Yes, [[G3483]] of Gentiles [[G1484]] too, [[G2532]]

###### 30
since [there is only] [[G1512]] one [[G1520]] God, [[G2316]] who [[G3739]] will justify [[G1344]] [the] circumcised [[G4061]] by [[G1537]] faith [[G4102]] and [[G2532]] [the] uncircumcised [[G203]] through [[G1223]] that [same] [[G3588]] faith. [[G4102]]

###### 31
Do we, then, nullify [[G2673]] [the] Law [[G3551]] by [[G1223]] [this] [[G3588]] faith? [[G4102]] Absolutely not! [[G1096]] Instead, [[G235]] we uphold [[G2476]] [the] Law. [[G3551]]
