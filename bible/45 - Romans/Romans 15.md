###### 1
We [[G1473]] who [are] [[G3588]] strong [[G1415]] ought [[G3784]] to bear with [[G941]] the [[G3588]] shortcomings [[G771]] of the [[G3588]] weak [[G102]] and [[G2532]] not [[G3361]] to please [[G700]] ourselves. [[G1438]]

###### 2
Each [[G1538]] of us [[G1473]] should please [[G700]] [his] [[G3588]] neighbor [[G4139]] for [[G1519]] [his] [[G3588]] good, [[G18]] to [[G4314]] build [him] up. [[G3619]]

###### 3
For [[G1063]] even [[G2532]] Christ [[G5547]] {did} not [[G3756]] please [[G700]] Himself, [[G1438]] but [[G235]] as [[G2531]] it is written: [[G1125]] “The [[G3588]] insults [[G3680]] of those who [[G3588]] insult [[G3679]] You [[G4771]] have fallen [[G1968]] on [[G1909]] Me.” [[G1473]]

###### 4
For [[G1063]] everything that [[G3745]] was written in the past [[G4270]] was written [[G1125]] for [[G1519]] our [[G2251]] instruction, [[G1319]] so that [[G2443]] through [[G1223]] endurance [[G5281]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] encouragement [[G3874]] of the [[G3588]] Scriptures, [[G1124]] we might have [[G2192]] hope. [[G1680]]

###### 5
Now [[G1161]] {may} the [[G3588]] God [[G2316]] of endurance [[G5281]] and [[G2532]] encouragement [[G3874]] grant [[G1325]] you [[G4771]] harmony [[G5426]] with [[G1722]] one another [[G240]] in [[G2596]] Christ [[G5547]] Jesus, [[G2424]]

###### 6
so that [[G2443]] with one mind [[G3661]] [and] [[G1722]] one [[G1520]] voice [[G4750]] you may glorify [[G1392]] the [[G3588]] God [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] Father [[G3962]] of our [[G1473]] Lord [[G2962]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ. [[G5547]]

###### 7
Accept [[G4355]] one another, [[G240]] then, [[G1352]] just [[G2532]] as [[G2531]] Christ [[G5547]] accepted [[G4355]] you, [[G4771]] in order to bring [[G1519]] glory [[G1391]] to God. [[G2316]]

###### 8
For [[G1063]] I tell [you that] [[G3004]] Christ [[G5547]] has become [[G1096]] a servant [[G1249]] of [the] Jews [[G4061]] on behalf of [[G5228]] God’s [[G2316]] truth, [[G225]] to [[G1519]] confirm [[G950]] the [[G3588]] promises made [[G1860]] to the [[G3588]] patriarchs, [[G3962]]

###### 9
[so that] [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] Gentiles [[G1484]] may glorify [[G1392]] God [[G2316]] for [His] [[G5228]] mercy. [[G1656]] As [[G2531]] it is written: [[G1125]] “Therefore [[G1223]] I will praise [[G1843]] You [[G4771]] among [[G1722]] [the] Gentiles; [[G1484]] I will sing hymns [[G5567]] to [[G3588]] Your [[G4771]] name.” [[G3686]]

###### 10
Again, [[G3825]] it says: [[G3004]] “Rejoice, [[G2165]] O Gentiles, [[G1484]] with [[G3326]] His [[G846]] people.” [[G2992]]

###### 11
And [[G2532]] again: [[G3825]] “Praise [[G134]] the [[G3588]] Lord, [[G2962]] all [[G3956]] [you] [[G3588]] Gentiles, [[G1484]] and [[G2532]] extol [[G1867]] Him, [[G846]] all [[G3956]] [you] [[G3588]] peoples.” [[G2992]]

###### 12
And [[G2532]] once more, [[G3825]] Isaiah [[G2268]] says: [[G3004]] “The [[G3588]] root [[G4491]] of Jesse [[G2421]] will appear, [[G1510]] [One who] [[G3588]] will arise [[G450]] to rule over [[G757]] [the] Gentiles; [[G1484]] in [[G1909]] Him [[G846]] [the] Gentiles [[G1484]] will put their hope.” [[G1679]]

###### 13
Now [[G1161]] {may} the [[G3588]] God [[G2316]] of hope [[G1680]] fill [[G4137]] you [[G4771]] with all [[G3956]] joy [[G5479]] and [[G2532]] peace [[G1515]] as you [[G1722]] believe [in Him], [[G4100]] so that [[G1519]] you [[G4771]] may overflow [[G4052]] with [[G1722]] hope [[G1680]] by [[G1722]] [the] power [[G1411]] [of the] Holy [[G40]] Spirit. [[G4151]]

###### 14
I [[G1473]] myself [[G846]] am convinced, [[G3982]] my [[G1473]] brothers, [[G80]] that [[G3754]] you yourselves [[G846]] are [[G1510]] full [[G3324]] of goodness, [[G19]] brimming [[G4137]] with [[G3956]] knowledge, [[G1108]] and [[G2532]] able [[G1410]] to instruct [[G3560]] one another. [[G240]]

###### 15
However, [[G1161]] I have written [[G1125]] you [[G4771]] a bold [[G5112]] reminder [[G1878]] on [[G575]] some points, [[G3313]] because of [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] grace [[G5485]] God [[G2316]] gave [[G1325]] me [[G1473]]

###### 16
to be [[G1510]] a minister [[G3011]] of Christ [[G5547]] Jesus [[G2424]] to [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] Gentiles [[G1484]] in the priestly service [[G2418]] of the [[G3588]] gospel [[G2098]] of God, [[G2316]] so that [[G2443]] the [[G3588]] Gentiles [[G1484]] might become [[G1096]] [an] acceptable [[G2144]] offering to God, [[G4376]] sanctified [[G37]] by [[G1722]] [the] Holy [[G40]] Spirit. [[G4151]]

###### 17
Therefore [[G3767]] I exult [[G2746]] in [[G1722]] Christ [[G5547]] Jesus [[G2424]] in [ my service ] [[G3588]] to [[G4314]] God. [[G2316]]

###### 18
I will not presume [[G5111]] to speak [[G2980]] of anything [[G5100]] except [[G3756]] what [[G3739]] Christ [[G5547]] has accomplished [[G2716]] through [[G1223]] me [[G1473]] in leading [[G1519]] [the] Gentiles [[G1484]] to obedience [[G5218]] by word [[G3056]] and [[G2532]] deed, [[G2041]]

###### 19
by [[G1722]] [the] power [[G1411]] of signs [[G4592]] and [[G2532]] wonders, [[G5059]] [and] by [[G1722]] [the] power [[G1411]] of [the] Spirit [[G4151]] of God. [[G2316]] So [[G5620]] from [[G575]] Jerusalem [[G2419]] all the way [[G2532]] around [[G2945]] to [[G3360]] Illyricum, [[G2437]] I [[G1473]] have fully proclaimed [[G4137]] the [[G3588]] gospel [[G2098]] of Christ. [[G5547]]

###### 20
In this way, [[G3779]] I have aspired [[G5389]] to preach the gospel [[G2097]] where [[G3699]] Christ [[G5547]] was not known, [[G3687]] so that [[G2443]] I would not be building [[G3618]] on [[G1909]] someone [else’s] [[G245]] foundation. [[G2310]]

###### 21
Rather, [[G235]] as [[G2531]] it is written: [[G1125]] “Those who [[G3739]] were not told [[G312]] about [[G4012]] Him [[G846]] will see, [[G3708]] and [[G2532]] those who [[G3739]] have not heard [[G191]] will understand.” [[G4920]]

###### 22
That is why [[G1352]] I have often been hindered [[G1465]] from coming [[G2064]] to [[G4314]] you. [[G4771]]

###### 23
But [[G1161]] now that [[G3570]] [there are] no further [[G3371]] opportunities [[G5117]] for me [[G2192]] in [[G1722]] these [[G3778]] regions, [[G2824]] and [[G1161]] since I have [[G2192]] longed [[G1974]] for [[G575]] many [[G2425]] years [[G2094]] to visit [[G2064]] you, [[G4771]]

###### 24
I hope [[G1679]] to see [[G2300]] you [[G4771]] on [[G5613]] my way [[G4198]] to [[G1519]] Spain. [[G4681]] And [[G2532]] [after] [[G1437]] I have enjoyed your company [[G1705]] for [[G575]] a while, [[G3313]] you can equip me [[G4311]] [for my journey]. [[G1563]]

###### 25
Now, [[G3570]] however, [[G1161]] I am on my way [[G4198]] to [[G1519]] Jerusalem [[G2419]] to serve [[G1247]] the [[G3588]] saints [there]. [[G40]]

###### 26
For [[G1063]] Macedonia [[G3109]] and [[G2532]] Achaia [[G882]] were pleased [[G2106]] to make [[G4160]] a [[G5100]] contribution [[G2842]] for [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] poor [[G4434]] among the [[G3588]] saints [[G40]] in [[G1722]] Jerusalem. [[G2419]]

###### 27
They were pleased [to do it], [[G2106]] and [[G2532]] indeed [[G1063]] they [[G1510]] owe it [[G3781]] to them. [[G846]] For [[G1063]] if [[G1487]] the [[G3588]] Gentiles [[G1484]] have shared in [[G2841]] their [[G846]] spiritual [[G4152]] [blessings], [[G3588]] they are obligated [[G3784]] to minister [[G3008]] to them [[G846]] with [[G1722]] material [blessings]. [[G4559]]

###### 28
So [[G3767]] after I have completed [[G2005]] this [service] [[G3778]] and [[G2532]] safely delivered [[G4972]] this [[G3778]] bounty [[G2590]] to them, [[G846]] I will set off [[G565]] to [[G1519]] Spain [[G4681]] by way of [[G1223]] you. [[G4771]]

###### 29
I know [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] when I come [[G2064]] to [[G4314]] you, [[G4771]] I will come [[G2064]] in [[G1722]] [the] fullness [[G4138]] of the blessing [[G2129]] of Christ. [[G5547]]

###### 30
Now [[G1161]] I urge [[G3870]] you, [[G4771]] brothers, [[G80]] by [[G1223]] our [[G1473]] Lord [[G2962]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ [[G5547]] and [[G2532]] by [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] love [[G26]] of the [[G3588]] Spirit, [[G4151]] to join me in my struggle [[G4865]] by [[G1722]] praying [[G4335]] to [[G4314]] God [[G2316]] for [[G5228]] me. [[G1473]]

###### 31
[Pray] that [[G2443]] I may be delivered [[G4506]] from [[G575]] the [[G3588]] unbelievers [[G544]] in [[G1722]] Judea, [[G2449]] and [that] [[G2532]] my [[G1473]] service [[G1248]] in [[G1519]] Jerusalem [[G2419]] may be [[G1096]] acceptable [[G2144]] to the [[G3588]] saints [there], [[G40]]

###### 32
so that [[G2443]] by [[G1223]] God’s [[G2316]] will [[G2307]] I may come [[G2064]] to [[G4314]] you [[G4771]] with [[G1722]] joy [[G5479]] and together with you be refreshed. [[G4875]]

###### 33
The [[G3588]] God [[G2316]] of peace [[G1515]] [be] with [[G3326]] all [[G3956]] of you. [[G4771]] Amen. [[G281]]
