### 1
Do you not know, [[G50]] brothers [[G80]] (for [[G1063]] I am speaking [[G2980]] to those who know [[G1097]] [the] law), [[G3551]] that [[G3754]] the [[G3588]] law [[G3551]] has authority over [[G2961]] a man [[G444]] only [[G1909]] as long as [[G3745]] he lives? [[G2198]]

### 2
For instance, [[G3588]] a married [[G5220]] woman [[G1135]] is bound [[G1210]] by law [[G3551]] to [her] [[G3588]] husband [[G435]] as long as he lives. [[G2198]] But [[G1161]] if [[G1437]] [her] [[G3588]] husband [[G435]] dies, [[G599]] she is released [[G2673]] from [[G575]] the [[G3588]] law [[G3551]] of [[G3588]] [marriage]. [[G435]]

### 3
So [[G3767]] then, [[G686]] if [[G1437]] she is [joined] [[G1096]] to another [[G2087]] man [[G435]] [while her] husband [[G435]] is [still] alive, [[G2198]] she is called [[G5537]] an adulteress; [[G3428]] but [[G1161]] if [[G1437]] [her] [[G3588]] husband [[G435]] dies, [[G599]] she is [[G1510]] free [[G1658]] from [[G575]] that [[G3588]] law [[G3551]] [and] [[G846]] is [[G1510]] not [[G3361]] an adulteress, [[G3428]] [even if she marries] [[G1096]] another [[G2087]] man. [[G435]]

### 4
Therefore, [[G5620]] my [[G1473]] brothers, [[G80]] you [[G4771]] also [[G2532]] died [[G2289]] to the [[G3588]] Law [[G3551]] through [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] body [[G4983]] of Christ, [[G5547]] that [[G1519]] you [[G4771]] might belong [[G1096]] to another, [[G2087]] to [Him who] [[G3588]] was raised [[G1453]] from [[G1537]] [the] dead, [[G3498]] in order that [[G2443]] we might bear fruit [[G2592]] to God. [[G2316]]

### 5
For [[G1063]] when [[G3753]] we [lived] [[G1510]] according to [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] flesh, [[G4561]] the [[G3588]] sinful [[G266]] passions [[G3804]] [aroused] by [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] Law [[G3551]] were at work [[G1754]] in [[G1722]] our [[G1473]] bodies, [[G3196]] bearing fruit [[G2592]] for death. [[G2288]]

### 6
But [[G1161]] now, [[G3570]] having died [[G599]] to [[G1722]] what [[G3739]] bound us, [[G2722]] we have been released [[G2673]] from [[G575]] the [[G3588]] Law, [[G3551]] so that [[G5620]] we [[G1473]] serve [[G1398]] in [[G1722]] the new way [[G2538]] of the Spirit, [[G4151]] and [[G2532]] not [[G3756]] in the old way [[G3821]] of the written code. [[G1121]]

### 7
What [[G5101]] then [[G3767]] shall we say? [[G2046]] [Is] the [[G3588]] Law [[G3551]] sin? [[G266]] Absolutely not! [[G1096]] Indeed, [[G235]] I would not have been mindful of [[G1097]] sin [[G266]] if [[G1487]] not [[G3361]] for [[G1223]] the Law. [[G3551]] For [[G1063]] I would not have been aware of [[G1492]] coveting [[G1939]] if [[G1487]] the [[G3588]] Law [[G3551]] {had} not [[G3361]] said, [[G2036]] Do not covet. [[G1937]]

### 8
But [[G1161]] sin, [[G266]] seizing [[G2983]] [its] opportunity [[G874]] through [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] commandment, [[G1785]] produced [[G2716]] in [[G1722]] me [[G1473]] every kind [[G3956]] of covetous desire. [[G1939]] For [[G1063]] apart from [[G5565]] [the] Law, [[G3551]] sin [[G266]] [is] dead. [[G3498]]

### 9
Once [[G4218]] I [[G1473]] was alive [[G2198]] apart from [[G5565]] [the] Law; [[G3551]] but [when] [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] commandment [[G1785]] came, [[G2064]] sin [[G266]] sprang to life [[G326]] and [[G1161]] I [[G1473]] died. [[G599]]

### 10
So [[G2532]] I [[G1473]] discovered that [[G2147]] the [[G3778]] very [[G3588]] commandment [[G1785]] that was [[G3588]] meant to bring [[G1519]] life [[G2222]] [actually brought] [[G1519]] death. [[G2288]]

### 11
For [[G1063]] sin, [[G266]] seizing [[G2983]] [its] opportunity [[G874]] through [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] commandment, [[G1785]] deceived [[G1818]] me [[G1473]] and [[G2532]] through [[G1223]] [the commandment] [[G846]] put [me] to death. [[G615]]

### 12
So [[G5620]] then, [[G3303]] the [[G3588]] Law [is] [[G3551]] holy, [[G40]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] commandment [is] [[G1785]] holy, [[G40]] righteous, [[G1342]] and [[G2532]] good. [[G18]]

### 13
{Did} that which [[G3588]] [is] good, [[G18]] then, [[G3767]] become [[G1096]] death [[G2288]] to me? [[G1473]] Absolutely not! [[G1096]] But [[G235]] in order that [[G2443]] sin [[G266]] might be exposed as [[G5316]] sin, [[G266]] it produced [[G2716]] death [[G2288]] in me [[G1473]] through [[G1223]] what [was] [[G3588]] good, [[G18]] so that [[G2443]] through [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] commandment [[G1785]] sin [[G266]] might become [[G1096]] utterly [[G5236]] sinful. [[G268]]

### 14
We know [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] [the] Law [[G3551]] is [[G1510]] spiritual; [[G4152]] but [[G1161]] I [[G1473]] am [[G1510]] unspiritual, [[G4560]] sold as a slave [[G4097]] to [[G5259]] sin. [[G266]]

### 15
I do not understand [[G1097]] what [[G3739]] I do. [[G2716]] For [[G1063]] what [[G3739]] I want [to do], [[G2309]] I do not do. [[G4238]] But [[G235]] what [[G3739]] I hate, [[G3404]] I do. [[G4160]]

### 16
And [[G1161]] if [[G1487]] I do [[G4160]] what [[G3739]] I do not desire, [[G2309]] I admit [[G4852]] that [[G3754]] the [[G3588]] Law [[G3551]] [is] good. [[G2570]]

### 17
In that case, [[G3570]] {it is} no longer [[G3765]] I [[G1473]] who do [[G2716]] it, [[G846]] but [it is] [[G235]] sin [[G266]] living [[G3611]] in [[G1722]] me [ that does it ]. [[G1473]]

### 18
I know [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] nothing [[G3756]] good [[G18]] lives [[G3611]] in [[G1722]] me, [[G1473]] that [[G3778]] is, [[G1510]] in [[G1722]] my [[G1473]] flesh; [[G4561]] for [[G1063]] I [[G1473]] have [[G3873]] the [[G3588]] desire [[G2309]] to do [[G2716]] what is [[G3588]] good, [[G2570]] but [[G1161]] [I] cannot [carry it out]. [[G3756]]

### 19
For [[G1063]] I do not do [[G4160]] [the] good [[G18]] I want [to do]. [[G2309]] Instead, [[G235]] I keep on doing [[G4238]] [the] evil [[G2556]] I do not want [to do]. [[G2309]]

### 20
And [[G1161]] if [[G1487]] I [[G1473]] do [[G4160]] what [[G3739]] I do not want, [[G2309]] [it is] no longer [[G3765]] I [[G1473]] who do [[G2716]] it, [[G846]] but [it is] [[G235]] sin [[G266]] living [[G3611]] in [[G1722]] me [ that does it ]. [[G1473]]

### 21
So [[G686]] [this is] the [[G3588]] principle [[G3551]] I have discovered: [[G2147]] When I [[G1473]] want [[G2309]] to do [[G4160]] good, [[G2570]] evil [[G2556]] is right there with [[G3873]] me. [[G1473]]

### 22
For [[G1063]] in [my] [[G3588]] inner [[G2080]] being [[G444]] I delight [[G4913]] in [[G3588]] God’s [[G2316]] Law. [[G3551]]

### 23
But [[G1161]] I see [[G991]] another [[G2087]] law [ at work ] [[G3551]] in [[G1722]] my [[G1473]] body, [[G3196]] warring against [[G497]] the [[G3588]] law [[G3551]] of my [[G1473]] mind [[G3563]] and [[G2532]] holding me captive [[G163]] to [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] law [[G3551]] of sin [[G266]] that dwells [[G1510]] within [[G1722]] [me]. [[G3196]]

### 24
[What a] wretched [[G5005]] man [[G444]] I am! [[G1473]] Who [[G5101]] will rescue [[G4506]] me [[G1473]] from [[G1537]] this [[G3778]] body [[G4983]] of death? [[G2288]]

### 25
Thanks [be] [[G5485]] to [[G3588]] God, [[G2316]] through [[G1223]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ [[G5547]] our [[G1473]] Lord! [[G2962]] So [[G3767]] then, [[G686]] with [my] [[G3588]] mind [[G3563]] I [[G1473]] serve [[G1398]] [the] law [[G3551]] of God, [[G2316]] but [[G1161]] [with my] [[G3588]] flesh [[G4561]] [I serve the] law [[G3551]] of sin. [[G266]]
