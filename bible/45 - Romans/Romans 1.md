### 1
Paul, [[G3972]] a servant [[G1401]] of Jesus [[G2424]] Christ, [[G5547]] called [to be] [[G2822]] [an] apostle, [[G652]] [and] set apart [[G873]] for [[G1519]] [the] gospel [[G2098]] of God, [[G2316]]

### 2
which [[G3739]] He promised beforehand [[G4279]] through [[G1223]] His [[G846]] prophets [[G4396]] in [[G1722]] [the] Holy [[G40]] Scriptures, [[G1124]]

### 3
regarding [[G4012]] His [[G846]] Son, [[G5207]] who [[G3588]] was a descendant [[G1096]] of David [[G1138]] according to [[G2596]] [the] flesh, [[G4561]]

### 4
[and] who [[G3588]] through [[G2596]] [the] Spirit [[G4151]] of holiness [[G42]] was declared [[G3724]] with [[G1722]] power [[G1411]] [to be the] Son [[G5207]] of God [[G2316]] by [[G1537]] [His] resurrection [[G386]] [from the] dead: [[G3498]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ [[G5547]] our [[G1473]] Lord. [[G2962]]

### 5
Through [[G1223]] [Him] [[G3739]] [and] on behalf of [[G5228]] His [[G846]] name, [[G3686]] we received [[G2983]] grace [[G5485]] and [[G2532]] apostleship [[G651]] to call [[G1519]] all [those] [[G3956]] among [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] Gentiles [[G1484]] [to the] obedience [[G5218]] that comes from faith. [[G4102]]

### 6
[And] you [[G4771]] also [[G2532]] are [[G1510]] among [[G1722]] those who are [[G3739]] called [[G2822]] [to belong to] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ. [[G5547]]

### 7
To all [[G3956]] in [[G1722]] Rome [[G4516]] who are loved [[G27]] by God [[G2316]] [and] called to be [[G2822]] saints: [[G40]] Grace [[G5485]] and [[G2532]] peace [[G1515]] to you [[G4771]] from [[G575]] God [[G2316]] our [[G1473]] Father [[G3962]] and [[G2532]] [the] Lord [[G2962]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ. [[G5547]]

### 8
First, [[G4412]] I thank [[G2168]] my [[G1473]] God [[G2316]] through [[G1223]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ [[G5547]] for [[G4012]] all [[G3956]] of you, [[G4771]] because [[G3754]] your [[G4771]] faith [[G4102]] is being proclaimed [[G2605]] all [[G3650]] over [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] world. [[G2889]]

### 9
God, [[G2316]] whom [[G3739]] I serve [[G3000]] with [[G1722]] my [[G1473]] spirit [[G4151]] in [preaching] [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] gospel [[G2098]] of [[G3588]] His [[G846]] Son, [[G5207]] is [[G1510]] my [[G1473]] witness [[G3144]] how [[G5613]] constantly [[G89]] I remember [[G3417]] you [[G4771]]

### 10
in [[G1909]] my [[G1473]] prayers [[G4335]] at all times, [[G3842]] asking [[G1189]] that [[G1487]] now [[G2235]] at last [[G4218]] by [[G1722]] God’s [[G2316]] will [[G2307]] I may succeed [[G2137]] in coming [[G2064]] to [[G4314]] you. [[G4771]]

### 11
For [[G1063]] I long [[G1971]] to see [[G3708]] you [[G4771]] so that [[G2443]] I may impart [[G3330]] to you [[G4771]] some [[G5100]] spiritual [[G4152]] gift [[G5486]] to [[G1519]] strengthen [[G4741]] you, [[G4771]]

### 12
that [[G3778]] is, [[G1510]] [that] [[G5037]] you [[G4771]] and [[G2532]] I [[G1473]] may be mutually encouraged [[G4837]] by [[G1223]] each other’s [[G240]] faith. [[G4102]]

### 13
I do not want [[G2309]] you [[G4771]] to be unaware, [[G50]] brothers, [[G80]] how [[G3754]] often [[G4178]] I planned [[G4388]] to come [[G2064]] to [[G4314]] you [[G4771]] ([but] [[G2532]] have been prevented [from visiting] [[G2967]] until [[G891]] now), [[G1204]] in order that [[G2443]] I might have [[G2192]] a [[G5100]] harvest [[G2590]] among [[G1722]] you, [[G4771]] just [[G2532]] as [[G2531]] [I have had] among [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] other [[G3062]] Gentiles. [[G1484]]

### 14
I am [[G1510]] obligated [[G3781]] both [[G5037]] to Greeks [[G1672]] and [[G2532]] non-Greeks, [[G915]] both [[G5037]] to [the] wise [[G4680]] and [[G2532]] [the] foolish. [[G453]]

### 15
That is why [[G3779]] I [[G1473]] am [so] eager [[G4289]] to preach the gospel [[G2097]] also [[G2532]] to you [[G4771]] who [are] [[G3588]] in [[G1722]] Rome. [[G4516]]

### 16
I am not ashamed of [[G1870]] the [[G3588]] gospel, [[G2098]] because [[G1063]] it is [[G1510]] [the] power [[G1411]] of God [[G2316]] for [[G1519]] salvation [[G4991]] to everyone [[G3956]] who [[G3588]] believes, [[G4100]] first [[G4412]] to [the] Jew, [[G2453]] then [[G2532]] to [the] Greek. [[G1672]]

### 17
For [[G1063]] [the gospel] [[G846]] reveals [[G601]] [the] righteousness [[G1343]] of God [[G2316]] [that comes] by [[G1537]] faith [from start] [[G4102]] to [[G1519]] [finish], [[G4102]] just as [[G2531]] it is written: [[G1125]] “The [[G3588]] righteous [[G1342]] will live [[G2198]] by [[G1537]] faith.” [[G4102]]

### 18
[The] wrath [[G3709]] of God [[G2316]] is being revealed [[G601]] from [[G575]] heaven [[G3772]] against [[G1909]] all [[G3956]] [the] godlessness [[G763]] and [[G2532]] wickedness [[G93]] of men [[G444]] who [[G3588]] suppress [[G2722]] the [[G3588]] truth [[G225]] by [[G1722]] [their] wickedness. [[G93]]

### 19
For [[G1360]] [what may be] [[G3588]] known [[G1110]] [about] God [[G2316]] is [[G1510]] plain [[G5318]] to [[G1722]] them, [[G846]] because [[G1063]] God [[G2316]] has made [it] plain [[G5319]] to them. [[G846]]

### 20
For [[G1063]] since [[G575]] [the] creation [[G2937]] of [the] world [[G2889]] [God’s] [[G846]] invisible qualities, [[G517]] His [[G846]] eternal [[G126]] power [[G1411]] and [[G2532]] divine nature, [[G2305]] have been clearly seen, [[G2529]] being understood [[G3539]] from [[G3588]] His workmanship, [[G4161]] so that [[G1519]] [men] [[G846]] are [[G1510]] without excuse. [[G379]]

### 21
For [[G1360]] although they knew [[G1097]] God, [[G2316]] they neither glorified [Him] [[G1392]] as [[G5613]] God [[G2316]] [nor] [[G2228]] gave thanks [to Him], [[G2168]] but [[G235]] they became futile [[G3154]] in [[G1722]] their [[G846]] thinking [[G1261]] and [[G2532]] darkened [[G4654]] in their [[G846]] foolish [[G801]] hearts. [[G2588]]

### 22
Although they claimed [[G5335]] to be [[G1510]] wise, [[G4680]] they became fools, [[G3471]]

### 23
and [[G2532]] exchanged [[G236]] the [[G3588]] glory [[G1391]] of the [[G3588]] immortal [[G862]] God [[G2316]] for [[G1722]] images [[G1504]] of mortal [[G5349]] man [[G444]] and [[G2532]] birds [[G4071]] and [[G2532]] animals [[G5074]] and [[G2532]] reptiles. [[G2062]]

### 24
Therefore [[G1352]] God [[G2316]] gave them over [[G3860]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] desires [[G1939]] of [[G3588]] their [[G846]] hearts [[G2588]] to [[G1519]] impurity [[G167]] for the [[G3588]] dishonoring [[G818]] of their [[G846]] bodies [[G4983]] with [[G1722]] [one another]. [[G846]]

### 25
[They] [[G3748]] exchanged [[G3337]] the [[G3588]] truth [[G225]] of God [[G2316]] for [[G1722]] a lie, [[G5579]] and [[G2532]] worshiped [[G4573]] and [[G2532]] served [[G3000]] created things [[G2937]] rather than [[G3844]] the [[G3588]] Creator, [[G2936]] who [[G3739]] is [[G1510]] forever [[G165]] worthy of praise! [[G2128]] Amen. [[G281]]

### 26
For this reason [[G1223]] God [[G2316]] gave them over [[G3860]] to [[G1519]] dishonorable [[G819]] passions. [[G3806]] Even [[G5037]] their [[G846]] women [[G2338]] exchanged [[G3337]] natural [[G5446]] relations [[G5540]] for [[G1519]] unnatural [[G5449]] [ones]. [[G3588]]

### 27
Likewise, [[G3668]] the [[G3588]] men [[G730]] abandoned [[G863]] natural [[G5446]] relations [[G5540]] with [[G3588]] women [[G2338]] [and] burned [[G1572]] with [[G1722]] lust [[G3715]] for [[G1519]] one another. [[G240]] Men [[G730]] committed [[G2716]] indecent [acts] [[G808]] with [[G1722]] [other] men, [[G730]] and [[G2532]] received [[G618]] in [[G1722]] themselves [[G1438]] the [[G3588]] due [[G1163]] penalty [[G489]] for [[G3588]] their [[G846]] error. [[G4106]]

### 28
Furthermore, [[G2532]] since [[G2531]] they did not see fit [[G1381]] to acknowledge [[G2192]] God, [[G2316]] [He] [[G2316]] gave them up [[G3860]] to [[G1519]] a depraved [[G96]] mind, [[G3563]] to do [[G4160]] what [[G3588]] ought not to be done. [[G2520]]

### 29
They have become filled with [[G4137]] every kind of [[G3956]] wickedness, [[G93]] evil, [[G4189]] greed, [[G4124]] [and] hatred. [[G2549]] [They are] full [[G3324]] of envy, [[G5355]] murder, [[G5408]] strife, [[G2054]] deceit, [[G1388]] [and] malice. [[G2550]] [They are] gossips, [[G5588]]

### 30
slanderers, [[G2637]] God-haters, [[G2319]] insolent, [[G5197]] arrogant, [[G5244]] [and] boastful. [[G213]] [They] invent [[G2182]] [new] forms of evil; [[G2556]] they disobey [[G545]] [their] parents. [[G1118]]

### 31
[They are] senseless, [[G801]] faithless, [[G802]] heartless, [[G794]] merciless. [[G415]]

### 32
[Although they] [[G3748]] know [[G1921]] God’s [[G2316]] righteous decree [[G1345]] that [[G3754]] those who [[G3588]] do [[G4238]] such [[G3588]] things [[G5108]] are [[G1510]] worthy [[G514]] of death, [[G2288]] {they} not [[G3756]] only [[G3440]] continue to do [[G4160]] these things, [[G846]] but [[G235]] also [[G2532]] approve of [[G4909]] those who [[G3588]] practice [them].
