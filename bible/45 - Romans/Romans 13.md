### 1
Everyone [[G3956]] must submit himself [[G5293]] to the governing authorities, [[G1849]] for [[G1063]] there is [[G1510]] no [[G3756]] authority [[G1849]] except [[G1487]] [that which is from] [[G5259]] God. [[G2316]] [The authorities] that [[G3588]] exist [[G1510]] have been appointed [[G5021]] by [[G5259]] God. [[G2316]]

### 2
Consequently, [[G5620]] the [one who] [[G3588]] resists [[G498]] authority [[G1849]] is opposing [[G436]] what [[G3588]] God [[G2316]] has set in place, [[G1296]] and [[G1161]] those who [[G3588]] [do so] [[G436]] will bring [[G2983]] judgment [[G2917]] on themselves. [[G1438]]

### 3
For [[G1063]] rulers [[G758]] are [[G1510]] not [[G3756]] a terror [[G5401]] to good [[G18]] conduct, [[G2041]] but [[G235]] bad. [[G2556]] Do you want [[G2309]] to be unafraid [[G5399]] of the [[G3588]] one in authority? [[G1849]] [Then] do [[G4160]] what [is] [[G3588]] right, [[G18]] and [[G2532]] you will have [[G2192]] his [[G846]] approval. [[G1868]]

### 4
For [[G1063]] he is [[G1510]] God’s [[G2316]] servant [[G1249]] for [[G1519]] your [[G4771]] good. [[G18]] But [[G1161]] if [[G1437]] you do [[G4160]] wrong, [[G2556]] be afraid, [[G5399]] for [[G1063]] he does not carry [[G5409]] the [[G3588]] sword [[G3162]] in vain. [[G1500]] He is [[G1510]] God’s [[G2316]] servant, [[G1249]] an agent [[G1558]] of [[G1519]] retribution [[G3709]] to the [[G3588]] wrongdoer. [[G2556]]

### 5
Therefore, [[G1352]] [it is] necessary [[G318]] to submit [ to authority ], [[G5293]] not [[G3756]] only [[G3440]] to avoid [[G1223]] punishment, [[G3709]] but [[G235]] also [[G2532]] as a matter of [[G1223]] conscience. [[G4893]]

### 6
This is also why [[G1223]] you pay [[G5055]] taxes. [[G5411]] For [[G1063]] [the authorities] are [[G1510]] God’s [[G2316]] servants, [[G3011]] who devote themselves [[G4342]] to [[G1519]] [their work]. [[G3778]]

### 7
Pay [[G591]] everyone [[G3956]] what [[G3588]] you owe [him]: [[G3782]] taxes [[G5411]] to whom [[G3588]] taxes [are due], [[G5411]] revenue [[G5056]] to whom [[G3588]] revenue [is due], [[G5056]] respect [[G5401]] to whom [[G3588]] respect [is due], [[G5401]] honor [[G5092]] to whom [[G3588]] honor [is due]. [[G5092]]

### 8
Be indebted [[G3784]] to no one, [[G3367]] except [[G1487]] to one another [[G240]] [in] love, [[G25]] for [[G1063]] he who [[G3588]] loves [[G25]] [his] [[G3588]] neighbor [[G2087]] has fulfilled [[G4137]] [the] Law. [[G3551]]

### 9
The [commandments] [[G3588]] “Do not commit adultery,” [[G3431]] “Do not murder,” [[G5407]] “Do not steal,” [[G2813]] “Do not covet,” [[G1937]] and [[G2532]] any [[G5100]] other [[G2087]] commandments, [[G1785]] are summed up [[G346]] in [[G1722]] this [[G3778]] [one] [[G3588]] decree: [[G3056]] “Love [[G25]] your [[G4771]] neighbor [[G4139]] as [[G5613]] yourself.” [[G4572]]

### 10
Love [[G26]] does no wrong [[G2556]] to [its] [[G3588]] neighbor. [[G4139]] Therefore [[G3767]] love [is] [[G26]] [the] fulfillment [[G4138]] of [the] Law. [[G3551]]

### 11
And [do] [[G2532]] this, [[G3778]] understanding [[G1492]] the [[G3588]] occasion. [[G2540]] [The] hour [[G5610]] has come [[G2235]] for you [[G4771]] to wake up [[G1453]] from [[G1537]] [your] slumber, [[G5258]] for [[G1063]] our [[G1473]] salvation [[G4991]] [is] nearer [[G1452]] now [[G3568]] than [[G2228]] when [[G3753]] we {first} believed. [[G4100]]

### 12
The [[G3588]] night [[G3571]] is nearly over; [[G4298]] the [[G3588]] day [[G2250]] has drawn near. [[G1448]] So [[G3767]] let us lay aside [[G659]] the [[G3588]] deeds [[G2041]] of darkness [[G4655]] and [[G1161]] put on [[G1746]] the [[G3588]] armor [[G3696]] of light. [[G5457]]

### 13
Let us behave [[G4043]] decently, [[G2156]] as [[G5613]] in [[G1722]] [the] daytime, [[G2250]] not [[G3361]] in carousing [[G2970]] and [[G2532]] drunkenness, [[G3178]] not [[G3361]] in sexual immorality [[G2845]] and [[G2532]] debauchery, [[G766]] not [[G3361]] in dissension [[G2054]] and [[G2532]] jealousy. [[G2205]]

### 14
Instead, [[G235]] clothe yourselves [[G1746]] with the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ, [[G5547]] and [[G2532]] make [[G4160]] no [[G3361]] provision [[G4307]] for [[G1519]] [the] desires [[G1939]] of the [[G3588]] flesh. [[G4561]]
