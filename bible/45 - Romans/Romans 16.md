###### 25
Now [[G1161]] to Him who [[G3588]] is able [[G1410]] to strengthen [[G4741]] you [[G4771]] by [[G2596]] my [[G1473]] gospel [[G2098]] and [[G2532]] by the [[G3588]] proclamation [[G2782]] of Jesus [[G2424]] Christ, [[G5547]] according to [[G2596]] [the] revelation [[G602]] of [the] mystery [[G3466]] concealed [[G4601]] for ages past, [[G166]]

###### 26

###### 27
[to the] only [[G3441]] wise [[G4680]] God [[G2316]] [be] [[G3588]] glory [[G1391]] forever [[G165]] through [[G1223]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ! [[G5547]] Amen. [[G281]]
