###### 1
Therefore [[G3767]] I urge [[G3870]] you, [[G4771]] brothers, [[G80]] on account of [[G1223]] God’s [[G2316]] mercy, [[G3628]] to offer [[G3936]] your [[G4771]] bodies [[G4983]] [as] living [[G2198]] sacrifices, [[G2378]] holy [[G40]] [and] pleasing [[G2101]] to God, [[G2316]] which is [[G3588]] your [[G4771]] spiritual [[G3050]] service of worship. [[G2999]]

###### 2
Do not be conformed [[G4964]] to this [[G3778]] world, [[G165]] but [[G235]] be transformed [[G3339]] by the [[G3588]] renewing [[G342]] of [your] [[G3588]] mind. [[G3563]] Then [[G1519]] you [[G4771]] will be able to discern [[G1381]] what [is] [[G5101]] the [[G3588]] good, [[G18]] pleasing, [[G2101]] and [[G2532]] perfect [[G5046]] will [[G2307]] of God. [[G2316]]

###### 3
For [[G1063]] by [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] grace [[G5485]] given [[G1325]] me [[G1473]] I say [[G3004]] to every one [[G3956]] of [[G1722]] you: [[G4771]] Do not think of yourself [[G5252]] more highly [[G3844]] than you ought, [[G1163]] but [[G235]] think of yourself [[G5426]] with [[G1519]] sober judgment, [[G4993]] according to [[G5613]] [the] measure [[G3358]] of faith [[G4102]] God [[G2316]] has given [[G3307]] [you]. [[G1538]]

###### 4
Just as [[G2509]] each of us has [[G2192]] one [[G1520]] body [[G4983]] with [[G1722]] many [[G4183]] members, [[G3196]] and [[G1161]] not [[G3756]] all [[G3956]] members [[G3196]] have [[G2192]] the [[G3588]] same [[G846]] function, [[G4234]]

###### 5
so [[G3779]] in [[G1722]] Christ [[G5547]] we who are [[G1510]] many [[G4183]] [are] one [[G1520]] body, [[G4983]] and [[G1161]] each [[G2596]] member [[G3196]] [belongs to] one [[G1520]] another. [[G240]]

###### 6
We have [[G2192]] different [[G1313]] gifts [[G5486]] according to [[G2596]] the [[G3588]] grace [[G5485]] given [[G1325]] us. [[G1473]] If [one’s gift is] [[G1535]] prophecy, [[G4394]] [let him use] it [[G2596]] in proportion [[G356]] to [his] [[G3588]] faith; [[G4102]]

###### 7
[if it is] [[G1535]] serving, [[G1248]] let him serve; [[G1248]] [if it is] [[G1535]] teaching, [[G1321]] let him teach; [[G1319]]

###### 8
[if it is] [[G1535]] encouraging, [[G3870]] let him encourage; [[G3874]] [if it is] [[G3588]] giving, [[G3330]] let him give generously; [[G572]] [if it is] [[G3588]] leading, [[G4291]] [ let him lead] with [[G1722]] diligence; [[G4710]] [if it is] [[G3588]] showing mercy, [[G1653]] [ let him do it] [[G1722]] cheerfully. [[G2432]]

###### 9
Love [[G26]] must be sincere. [[G505]] Detest [[G655]] what [is] [[G3588]] evil; [[G4190]] cling to [[G2853]] what [is] [[G3588]] good. [[G18]]

###### 10
Be devoted [[G5387]] to [[G1519]] one another [[G240]] in brotherly love. [[G5360]] Outdo yourselves [[G4285]] in honoring [[G5092]] one another. [[G240]]

###### 11
Do not let [[G3361]] [your] [[G3588]] zeal [[G4710]] subside; [[G3636]] keep your spiritual fervor, [[G2204]] serving [[G1398]] the [[G3588]] Lord. [[G2962]]

###### 12
Be joyful [[G5463]] in hope, [[G1680]] patient [[G5278]] in affliction, [[G2347]] persistent [[G4342]] in prayer. [[G4335]]

###### 13
Share with [[G2841]] the [[G3588]] saints [[G40]] who [are] [[G3588]] in need. [[G5532]] Practice [[G1377]] hospitality. [[G5381]]

###### 14
Bless [[G2127]] those who [[G3588]] persecute [[G1377]] you. [[G4771]] Bless [[G2127]] and [[G2532]] {do} not [[G3361]] curse. [[G2672]]

###### 15
Rejoice [[G5463]] with [[G3326]] those who rejoice; [[G5463]] weep [[G2799]] with [[G3326]] those who weep. [[G2799]]

###### 16
Live in harmony [[G5426]] with [[G1519]] one another. [[G240]] Do not be proud, [[G5426]] but [[G235]] enjoy the company [[G4879]] of the [[G3588]] lowly. [[G5011]] {Do} not [[G3361]] be [[G1096]] conceited. [[G5429]]

###### 17
Do not repay anyone [[G591]] evil [[G2556]] for [[G473]] evil. [[G2556]] Carefully consider [[G4306]] what is right [[G2570]] in the eyes of [[G1799]] everybody. [[G3956]]

###### 18
If [it is] [[G1487]] possible [[G1415]] on [[G1537]] your [part], [[G4771]] live at peace [[G1514]] with [[G3326]] everyone. [[G3956]]

###### 19
{Do} not [[G3361]] avenge [[G1556]] yourselves, [[G1438]] beloved, [[G27]] but [[G235]] leave [[G1325]] room [[G5117]] for [God’s] wrath. [[G3709]] For [[G1063]] it is written: [[G1125]] “Vengeance [is] [[G1557]] Mine; [[G1473]] I [[G1473]] will repay, [[G467]] says [[G3004]] [the] Lord.” [[G2962]]

###### 20
On the contrary, [[G235]] “If [[G1437]] your [[G4771]] enemy [[G2190]] is hungry, [[G3983]] feed [[G5595]] him; [[G846]] if [[G1437]] he is thirsty, [[G1372]] give him a drink. [[G4222]] For [[G1063]] in so doing, [[G4160]] you will heap [[G4987]] burning [[G4442]] coals [[G440]] on [[G1909]] his [[G846]] head.” [[G2776]]

###### 21
{Do} not [[G3361]] be overcome [[G3528]] by [[G5259]] evil, [[G2556]] but [[G235]] overcome [[G3528]] evil [[G2556]] with [[G1722]] good. [[G18]]
