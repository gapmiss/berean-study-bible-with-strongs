### 1
What [[G5101]] then [[G3767]] shall we say? [[G2046]] Shall we continue [[G1961]] in sin [[G266]] so that [[G2443]] grace [[G5485]] may increase? [[G4121]]

### 2
Absolutely not! [[G1096]] How {can we} [[G4459]] who [[G3748]] died [[G599]] to sin [[G266]] live [[G2198]] in [[G1722]] it [[G846]] any longer? [[G2089]]

### 3
Or [[G2228]] aren’t you aware [[G50]] that [[G3754]] all of [[G3745]] us who were baptized [[G907]] into [[G1519]] Christ [[G5547]] Jesus [[G2424]] were baptized [[G907]] into [[G1519]] His [[G846]] death? [[G2288]]

### 4
We therefore were buried [[G4916]] with Him [[G846]] through [[G1223]] baptism [[G908]] into [[G1519]] death, [[G2288]] in order that, [[G2443]] just as [[G5618]] Christ [[G5547]] was raised [[G1453]] from [[G1537]] [the] dead [[G3498]] through [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] glory [[G1391]] of the [[G3588]] Father, [[G3962]] we [[G1473]] too [[G2532]] may walk [[G4043]] in [[G1722]] newness [[G2538]] of life. [[G2222]]

### 5
For [[G1063]] if [[G1487]] we have been [[G1096]] united with Him [[G4854]] like this [[G3667]] in [[G3588]] His [[G846]] death, [[G2288]] we will certainly also be [[G1510]] raised to life [as He was]. [[G386]]

### 6
We know [[G1097]] that [[G3754]] our [[G1473]] old [[G3820]] self [[G444]] was crucified with [Him] [[G4957]] so that [[G2443]] the [[G3588]] body [[G4983]] of sin [[G266]] might be rendered powerless, [[G2673]] [that] we [[G1473]] {should} no longer [[G3371]] be slaves [[G1398]] to sin. [[G266]]

### 7
For [[G1063]] [anyone who] [[G3588]] has died [[G599]] has been freed [[G1344]] from [[G575]] sin. [[G266]]

### 8
Now [[G1161]] if [[G1487]] we died [[G599]] with [[G4862]] Christ, [[G5547]] we believe [[G4100]] that [[G3754]] we will also live with [[G4800]] Him. [[G846]]

### 9
[For] we know [[G1492]] that [since] [[G3754]] Christ [[G5547]] was raised [[G1453]] from [[G1537]] [the] dead, [[G3498]] He cannot die again; [[G599]] death [[G2288]] no longer [[G3765]] has dominion over [[G2961]] Him. [[G846]]

### 10
[The death] [[G3739]] He died, [[G599]] He died [[G599]] to sin [[G266]] once for all; [[G2178]] but [[G1161]] [the life] [[G3739]] He lives, [[G2198]] He lives [[G2198]] to God. [[G2316]]

### 11
So [[G3779]] you [[G4771]] too [[G2532]] must count [[G3049]] yourselves [[G1438]] dead [[G3498]] to sin, [[G266]] but [[G1161]] alive [[G2198]] to God [[G2316]] in [[G1722]] Christ [[G5547]] Jesus. [[G2424]]

### 12
Therefore [[G3767]] do not let sin control [[G936]] your [[G4771]] mortal [[G2349]] body [[G4983]] so that [[G1519]] you obey [[G5219]] its [[G846]] desires. [[G1939]]

### 13
{Do} not [[G3366]] present [[G3936]] the [[G3588]] parts [[G3196]] of your [body] [[G4771]] to sin [[G266]] as instruments [[G3696]] of wickedness, [[G93]] but [[G235]] present [[G3936]] yourselves [[G1438]] to God [[G2316]] as [those who have been] [[G5616]] [brought] from [[G1537]] death [[G3498]] to life; [[G2198]] and [present] [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] parts [[G3196]] of your [body] [[G4771]] to [Him] [[G2316]] as instruments [[G3696]] of righteousness. [[G1343]]

### 14
For [[G1063]] sin [[G266]] shall not be your master, [[G2961]] because [[G1063]] you are [[G1510]] not [[G3756]] under [[G5259]] law, [[G3551]] but [[G235]] under [[G5259]] grace. [[G5485]]

### 15
What [[G5101]] then? [[G3767]] Shall we sin [[G264]] because [[G3754]] we are [[G1510]] not [[G3756]] under [[G5259]] law, [[G3551]] but [[G235]] under [[G5259]] grace? [[G5485]] Absolutely not! [[G1096]]

### 16
Do you not know [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] [when] [[G3739]] you offer [[G3936]] yourselves [[G1438]] [as] [[G1519]] obedient [[G5218]] slaves, [[G1401]] you are [[G1510]] slaves [[G1401]] to [the one] [[G3739]] you obey, [[G5219]] whether [you are slaves] [[G2273]] to sin [[G266]] [leading] to [[G1519]] death, [[G2288]] or [[G2228]] to obedience [[G5218]] [leading] to [[G1519]] righteousness? [[G1343]]

### 17
But [[G1161]] thanks [be] [[G5485]] to God [[G2316]] that, [[G3754]] though you once were [[G1510]] slaves [[G1401]] to sin, [[G266]] you wholeheartedly obeyed [[G5219]] the form [[G5179]] of teaching [[G1322]] to [[G1519]] which [[G3739]] you were committed. [[G3860]]

### 18
You have been set free [[G1659]] from [[G575]] sin [[G266]] [and] have become slaves [[G1402]] to righteousness. [[G1343]]

### 19
I am speaking [[G3004]] in human terms [[G442]] because of [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] weakness [[G769]] of [[G3588]] your [[G4771]] flesh. [[G4561]] Just as [[G5618]] you used to offer [[G3936]] the [[G3588]] parts of [[G3196]] your [body] [[G4771]] in slavery [[G1401]] to impurity [[G167]] and [[G2532]] to [[G3588]] escalating [[G1519]] wickedness, [[G458]] so [[G3779]] now [[G3568]] offer [[G3936]] [them] [[G3196]] in slavery [[G1401]] to righteousness [[G1343]] leading to [[G1519]] holiness. [[G38]]

### 20
For [[G1063]] when [[G3753]] you were [[G1510]] slaves [[G1401]] to sin, [[G266]] you were [[G1510]] free of obligation [[G1658]] to righteousness. [[G1343]]

### 21
What [[G5101]] fruit [[G2590]] did you reap [[G2192]] at that time [[G5119]] from the [things] [[G1909]] of which [[G3739]] you are now ashamed? [[G1870]] The [[G3588]] outcome [[G5056]] of those things [[G1565]] [is] death. [[G2288]]

### 22
But [[G1161]] now [that] [[G3570]] you have been set free [[G1659]] from [[G575]] sin [[G266]] and [[G1161]] have become slaves [[G1402]] to God, [[G2316]] the [[G3588]] fruit [[G2590]] you reap [[G2192]] [leads to] [[G1519]] holiness, [[G38]] and [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] outcome [[G5056]] [is] eternal [[G166]] life. [[G2222]]

### 23
For [[G1063]] the [[G3588]] wages [[G3800]] of sin [[G266]] [is] death, [[G2288]] but [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] gift [[G5486]] of God [[G2316]] [is] eternal [[G166]] life [[G2222]] in [[G1722]] Christ [[G5547]] Jesus [[G2424]] our [[G1473]] Lord. [[G2962]]
