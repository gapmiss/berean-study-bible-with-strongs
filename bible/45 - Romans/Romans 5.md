### 1
Therefore, [[G3767]] since we have been justified [[G1344]] through [[G1537]] faith, [[G4102]] we have [[G2192]] peace [[G1515]] with [[G4314]] God [[G2316]] through [[G1223]] our [[G1473]] Lord [[G2962]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ, [[G5547]]

### 2
through [[G1223]] whom [[G3739]] we have gained [[G2192]] access [[G4318]] by [[G3588]] faith [[G4102]] into [[G1519]] this [[G3778]] grace [[G5485]] in [[G1722]] which [[G3739]] we stand; [[G2476]] and [[G2532]] we exult [[G2744]] in [[G1909]] [the] hope [[G1680]] of the [[G3588]] glory [[G1391]] of God. [[G2316]]

### 3
Not [[G3756]] only [[G3440]] [that], [[G1161]] but [[G235]] we also rejoice [[G2744]] in [[G1722]] [our] [[G3588]] sufferings, [[G2347]] because we know [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] suffering [[G2347]] produces [[G2716]] perseverance; [[G5281]]

### 4
perseverance, [[G5281]] character; [[G1382]] and [[G1161]] character, [[G1382]] hope. [[G1680]]

### 5
And [[G1161]] hope [[G1680]] does not disappoint [us], [[G2617]] because [[G3754]] God [[G2316]] has poured out [[G1632]] [His] [[G3588]] love [[G26]] into [[G1722]] our [[G1473]] hearts [[G2588]] through [[G1223]] [the] Holy [[G40]] Spirit, [[G4151]] whom [[G3588]] He has given [[G1325]] us. [[G1473]]

### 6
For [[G1063]] at [[G2596]] just [[G2089]] [the] right time, [[G2540]] while [[G1473]] we were [[G1510]] still [[G2089]] powerless, [[G772]] Christ [[G5547]] died [[G599]] for [[G5228]] [the] ungodly. [[G765]]

### 7
[It is] rare [[G3433]] indeed [[G1063]] [for] anyone [[G5100]] to die [[G599]] for [[G5228]] a righteous [man], [[G1342]] though [[G1063]] for [[G5228]] a good [man] [[G18]] someone [[G5100]] {might} possibly [[G5029]] dare [[G5111]] to die. [[G599]]

### 8
But [[G1161]] God [[G2316]] proves [[G4921]] His [[G1438]] love [[G26]] for [[G1519]] us [[G1473]] in this: [[G3754]] While we [[G1473]] were [[G1510]] still [[G2089]] sinners, [[G268]] Christ [[G5547]] died [[G599]] for [[G5228]] us. [[G1473]]

### 9
Therefore, [[G3767]] [since] we have now been justified [[G1344]] by [[G1722]] His [[G846]] blood, [[G129]] how much [[G4183]] more [[G3123]] shall we be saved [[G4982]] from [[G575]] wrath [[G3709]] through [[G1223]] Him! [[G846]]

### 10
For [[G1063]] if, [[G1487]] when we were [[G1510]] enemies [of God], [[G2190]] we were reconciled [[G2644]] to [Him] [[G2316]] through [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] death [[G2288]] of [[G3588]] His [[G846]] Son, [[G5207]] how much [[G4183]] more, [[G3123]] having been reconciled, [[G2644]] shall we be saved [[G4982]] through [[G1722]] His [[G846]] life! [[G2222]]

### 11
Not [[G3756]] only [[G3440]] that, [[G1161]] but [[G235]] we also rejoice [[G2744]] in [[G1722]] God [[G2316]] through [[G1223]] our [[G1473]] Lord [[G2962]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ, [[G5547]] through [[G1223]] whom [[G3739]] we have now received [[G2983]] reconciliation. [[G2643]]

### 12
Therefore, [[G1223]] just as [[G5618]] sin [[G266]] entered [[G1525]] the [[G3588]] world [[G2889]] through [[G1223]] one [[G1520]] man, [[G444]] and [[G2532]] death [[G2288]] through [[G1223]] sin, [[G266]] so [[G3779]] also [[G2532]] death [[G2288]] was passed on [[G1330]] to [[G1519]] all [[G3956]] men, [[G444]] because [[G1909]] all [[G3956]] sinned. [[G264]]

### 13
For [[G1063]] sin [[G266]] was [[G1510]] in [[G1722]] [the] world [[G2889]] before [[G891]] [the] Law [was given]; [[G3551]] but [[G1161]] sin [[G266]] is not taken into account [[G1677]] when there is [[G1510]] no [[G3361]] law. [[G3551]]

### 14
Nevertheless, [[G235]] death [[G2288]] reigned [[G936]] from [[G575]] Adam [[G76]] until [[G3360]] Moses, [[G3475]] even [[G2532]] over [[G1909]] those who [[G3588]] did not sin [[G264]] in [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] way that [[G3667]] Adam [[G76]] transgressed. [[G3847]] He [[G3739]] is [[G1510]] a pattern [[G5179]] of the [[G3588]] [One] to come. [[G3195]]

### 15
But [[G235]] the [[G3588]] gift [[G5486]] [is] not [[G3756]] like [[G5613]] the [[G3588]] trespass. [[G3900]] For [[G1063]] if [[G1487]] the [[G3588]] many [[G4183]] died [[G599]] by the [[G3588]] trespass [[G3900]] of the [[G3588]] one [man], [[G1520]] how much [[G4183]] more [[G3123]] {did} [[G3588]] God’s [[G2316]] grace [[G5485]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] gift [[G1431]] that came by [[G1722]] [the] grace [[G5485]] of the [[G3588]] one [[G1520]] man, [[G444]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ, [[G5547]] abound [[G4052]] to [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] many! [[G4183]]

### 16
Again, [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] gift [[G1434]] [is] not [[G3756]] like [[G5613]] [the result of] [[G1223]] the one [man’s] [[G1520]] sin: [[G264]] The [[G3588]] judgment [[G2917]] [that followed] [[G1537]] one [sin] [[G1520]] [brought] [[G1519]] condemnation, [[G2631]] but [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] gift [[G5486]] [that followed] [[G1537]] many [[G4183]] trespasses [[G3900]] [brought] [[G1519]] justification. [[G1345]]

### 17
For [[G1063]] if, [[G1487]] by the [[G3588]] trespass [[G3900]] of the [[G3588]] one [man], [[G1520]] death [[G2288]] reigned [[G936]] through [[G1223]] [that] [[G3588]] one [man], [[G1520]] how much [[G4183]] more [[G3123]] {will} those who [[G3588]] receive [[G2983]] an abundance [[G4050]] of grace [[G5485]] and [[G2532]] of the [[G3588]] gift [[G1431]] of righteousness [[G1343]] reign [[G936]] in [[G1722]] life [[G2222]] through [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] one man, [[G1520]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ! [[G5547]]

### 18
Therefore, [[G686]] just as [[G5613]] one [[G1520]] trespass [[G3900]] [brought] [[G1519]] condemnation [[G2631]] for [[G1519]] all [[G3956]] men, [[G444]] so [[G3779]] also [[G2532]] one [[G1520]] act of righteousness [[G1345]] [brought] [[G1519]] justification [[G1347]] [and] life [[G2222]] for [[G1519]] all [[G3956]] men. [[G444]]

### 19
For just as [[G5618]] through [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] disobedience [[G3876]] of the [[G3588]] one [[G1520]] man [[G444]] the [[G3588]] many [[G4183]] were made [[G2525]] sinners, [[G268]] so [[G3779]] also [[G2532]] through [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] obedience [[G5218]] of the [[G3588]] one [man] [[G1520]] the [[G3588]] many [[G4183]] will be made [[G2525]] righteous. [[G1342]]

### 20
[The] Law [[G3551]] was given [[G3922]] so that [[G2443]] the [[G3588]] trespass [[G3900]] would increase; [[G4121]] but [[G1161]] where [[G3757]] sin [[G266]] increased, [[G4121]] grace [[G5485]] increased all the more, [[G5248]]

### 21
so that, [[G2443]] just as [[G5618]] sin [[G266]] reigned [[G936]] in [[G1722]] death, [[G2288]] so [[G3779]] also [[G2532]] grace [[G5485]] might reign [[G936]] through [[G1223]] righteousness, [[G1343]] to bring [[G1519]] eternal [[G166]] life [[G2222]] through [[G1223]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ [[G5547]] our [[G1473]] Lord.
