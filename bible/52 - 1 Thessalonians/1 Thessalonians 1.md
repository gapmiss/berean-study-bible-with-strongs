### 1
Paul, [[G3972]] Silvanus, [[G4610]] and [[G2532]] Timothy, [[G5095]] To the [[G3588]] church [[G1577]] of the Thessalonians [[G2331]] in [[G1722]] God [[G2316]] [the] Father [[G3962]] and [[G2532]] [the] Lord [[G2962]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ: [[G5547]] Grace [[G5485]] and [[G2532]] peace [[G1515]] to you. [[G4771]]

### 2
We always thank [[G2168]] God [[G2316]] for [[G4012]] all [[G3956]] of you, [[G4771]] making [[G4160]] mention [of you] [[G3417]] in [[G1909]] our [[G1473]] prayers [[G4335]]

### 3
[and] continually [[G89]] recalling [[G3421]] before [[G1715]] our [[G1473]] God [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] Father [[G3962]] your [[G4771]] work [[G2041]] of faith, [[G4102]] [your] [[G3588]] labor [[G2873]] of love, [[G26]] and [[G2532]] [your] [[G3588]] enduring [[G5281]] hope [[G1680]] in [[G3588]] our [[G1473]] Lord [[G2962]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ. [[G5547]]

### 4
Brothers [[G80]] who are beloved [[G25]] by [[G5259]] God, [[G2316]] we know [[G1492]] [that] He has chosen [[G1589]] you, [[G4771]]

### 5
because [[G3754]] our [[G1473]] gospel [[G2098]] came [[G1096]] to [[G1519]] you [[G4771]] not [[G3756]] only [[G3440]] in [[G1722]] word, [[G3056]] but [[G235]] also [[G2532]] in [[G1722]] power, [[G1411]] in [[G1722]] [the] Holy [[G40]] Spirit, [[G4151]] and [[G2532]] with [[G1722]] great [[G4183]] conviction— [[G4136]] just as [[G2531]] you know [[G1492]] we lived [[G1096]] among [[G1722]] you [[G4771]] for your sake. [[G1223]]

### 6
And [[G2532]] you [[G4771]] became [[G1096]] imitators [[G3402]] of us [[G1473]] and [[G2532]] of the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] when you welcomed [[G1209]] the [[G3588]] message [[G3056]] with [[G3326]] [the] joy [[G5479]] of [the] Holy [[G40]] Spirit, [[G4151]] in [spite of your] [[G1722]] great [[G4183]] suffering. [[G2347]]

### 7
As a result, [[G5620]] you [[G4771]] have become [[G1096]] an example [[G5179]] to all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] believers [[G4100]] in [[G1722]] Macedonia [[G3109]] and [[G2532]] Achaia. [[G882]]

### 8
For [[G1063]] not [[G3756]] only [[G3440]] {did} the [[G3588]] message [[G3056]] of the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] ring out [[G1837]] from [[G575]] you [[G4771]] to [[G1722]] Macedonia [[G3109]] and [[G2532]] Achaia, [[G882]] but [[G235]] your [[G4771]] faith [[G4102]] in [[G4314]] God [[G2316]] has gone out [[G1831]] to [[G1722]] every [[G3956]] place, [[G5117]] so that [[G5620]] we [[G1473]] have [[G2192]] no [[G3361]] need [[G5532]] to say [[G2980]] anything [further]. [[G5100]]

### 9
For [[G1063]] they themselves [[G846]] report [[G518]] what kind [[G3697]] of welcome [[G1529]] you gave us, [[G2192]] and [[G2532]] how [[G4459]] you turned [[G1994]] away from [[G575]] idols [[G1497]] to serve [[G1398]] [the] living [[G2198]] and [[G2532]] TRUE [[G228]] God [[G2316]]

### 10
and [[G2532]] to await [[G362]] His [[G846]] Son [[G5207]] from [[G1537]] heaven, [[G3772]] whom [[G3739]] He raised [[G1453]] from [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] dead— [[G3498]] Jesus [[G2424]] our [[G1473]] deliverer [[G4506]] from [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] coming [[G2064]] wrath. [[G3709]]
