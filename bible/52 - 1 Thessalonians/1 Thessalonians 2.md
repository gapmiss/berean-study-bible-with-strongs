[[1 Thessalonians 1|←]] • [[1 Thessalonians 3|→]]

### 1
You yourselves [[G846]] know, [[G1492]] brothers, [[G80]] that [[G3754]] our [[G1473]] visit [[G1529]] to [[G4314]] you [[G4771]] was [[G1096]] not [[G3756]] in vain. [[G2756]]

### 2
As [[G2531]] you are aware, [[G1492]] we had already endured suffering [[G4310]] and [[G2532]] shameful treatment [[G5195]] in [[G1722]] Philippi. [[G5375]] But [[G235]] in the face of [[G1722]] strong [[G4183]] opposition, [[G73]] we were bold [[G3955]] in [[G1722]] our [[G1473]] God [[G2316]] to speak [[G2980]] the [[G3588]] gospel [[G2098]] of God [[G2316]] to [[G4314]] you. [[G4771]]

### 3
For [[G1063]] our [[G1473]] appeal [[G3874]] does not [[G3756]] arise from [[G1537]] deceit [[G4106]] [or] [[G3761]] ulterior motives [[G167]] [or] [[G3761]] trickery. [[G1388]]

### 4
Instead, [[G235]] we speak [[G2980]] as [[G2531]] those approved [[G1381]] by [[G5259]] God [[G2316]] to be entrusted with [[G4100]] the [[G3588]] gospel, [[G2098]] not [[G3756]] in order to [[G5613]] please [[G700]] men [[G444]] but [[G235]] God, [[G2316]] who [[G3588]] examines [[G1381]] our [[G1473]] hearts. [[G2588]]

### 5
As [[G2531]] you know, [[G1492]] we never used [[G1096]] words [[G3056]] of flattery [[G2850]] [or] [[G3777]] [any] pretext [[G4392]] for greed. [[G4124]] God [is] [[G2316]] [our] witness! [[G3144]]

### 6
Nor [[G3777]] did we seek [[G2212]] praise [[G1391]] from [[G575]] you [[G4771]] [or] [[G3777]] from [[G575]] anyone else, [[G243]] [although] as [[G5613]] apostles [[G652]] of Christ [[G5547]] we had authority [[G1410]] to demand [[G922]] [it]. [[G1722]]

### 7
On the contrary, [[G235]] we were [[G1096]] gentle [[G3516]] among [[G1722]] you, [[G4771]] like [[G5613]] a nursing mother [[G5162]] caring for [[G2282]] her [[G1438]] children. [[G5043]]

### 8
We cared so deeply [[G2442]] [that] we were delighted [[G2106]] to share with [[G3330]] you [[G4771]] not [[G3756]] only [[G3440]] the [[G3588]] gospel [[G2098]] of God, [[G2316]] but [[G235]] our [[G3588]] own [[G1438]] lives [[G5590]] as well. [[G2532]] That is how [[G1360]] beloved [[G27]] you have become [[G1096]] to us. [[G1473]]

### 9
Surely you recall, [[G3421]] brothers, [[G80]] our [[G1473]] labor [[G2873]] and [[G2532]] toil. [[G3449]] We worked [[G2038]] night [[G3571]] and [[G2532]] day [[G2250]] so that [[G4314]] we would not be a burden [[G1912]] to anyone [[G5100]] while we proclaimed [[G2784]] to [[G1519]] you [[G4771]] the [[G3588]] gospel [[G2098]] of God. [[G2316]]

### 10
You [are] [[G4771]] witnesses, [[G3144]] and [so is] [[G2532]] God, [[G2316]] of how [[G5613]] holy, [[G3743]] righteous, [[G1346]] and [[G2532]] blameless [[G274]] our conduct was [[G1096]] among you [[G4771]] who [[G3588]] believed. [[G4100]]

### 11
For [[G2509]] you know [[G1492]] that [we treated] [[G5613]] each [[G1538]] of you [[G4771]] as [[G5613]] a father [[G3962]] [treats] his own [[G1438]] children. [[G5043]]

### 12
We encouraged [you] [[G3870]] and [[G2532]] comforted [[G3888]] you [[G4771]] [as] [[G2532]] we urged [[G3143]] you [[G4771]] to walk [[G4043]] in a manner worthy [[G516]] of God, [[G2316]] who [[G3588]] calls [[G2564]] you [[G4771]] into [[G1519]] His own [[G1438]] kingdom [[G932]] and [[G2532]] glory. [[G1391]]

### 13
And [[G2532]] we [[G1473]] continually [[G89]] thank [[G2168]] God [[G2316]] that [[G3754]] in receiving [[G3880]] [the] word [[G3056]] of God [[G2316]] from [[G3844]] us, [[G1473]] you did not accept [it] [[G1209]] [as the] word [[G3056]] of men, [[G444]] but [[G235]] as [[G2531]] [the] true [[G230]] word [[G3056]] of God— [[G2316]] [ the word ] [[G3739]] now at work [[G1754]] in [[G1722]] you [[G4771]] who [[G3588]] believe. [[G4100]]

### 14
For [[G1063]] you, [[G4771]] brothers, [[G80]] became [[G1096]] imitators [[G3402]] of the [[G3588]] churches [[G1577]] of God [[G2316]] in [[G1722]] Judea [[G2449]] that [[G3588]] are [[G1510]] in [[G1722]] Christ [[G5547]] Jesus. [[G2424]] You [[G4771]] suffered [[G3958]] from [[G5259]] [your] [[G3588]] own [[G2398]] countrymen [[G4853]] the very things [[G3588]] they [[G846]] [suffered] [[G2532]] from [[G5259]] the [[G3588]] Jews, [[G2453]]

### 15
who [[G3588]] killed [[G615]] both [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] Jesus [[G2424]] and [[G2532]] their own [[G3588]] prophets, [[G4396]] and [[G2532]] drove us out {as well}. [[G1559]] They are displeasing [[G700]] to God [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] hostile [[G1727]] to all [[G3956]] men, [[G444]]

### 16
hindering [[G2967]] us [[G1473]] from telling [[G2980]] the [[G3588]] Gentiles [[G1484]] how [[G2443]] they may be saved. [[G4982]] As a result, [[G1519]] {they} continue [[G3842]] to heap up [[G378]] their [[G846]] sins {to full capacity}; [[G266]] the [[G1519]] utmost [[G5056]] wrath [[G3709]] has come [[G5348]] upon [[G1909]] them. [[G846]]

### 17
Brothers, [[G80]] although [[G1161]] we [[G1473]] were torn away [[G642]] from [[G575]] you [[G4771]] for [[G4314]] a short time [[G2540]] (in person, [[G4383]] not [[G3756]] in heart), [[G2588]] [our] [[G1722]] desire [[G1939]] to see [[G3708]] you [[G4771]] face [to face] [[G4383]] was even more intense. [[G4704]]

### 18
For [[G1360]] we wanted [[G2309]] to come [[G2064]] to [[G4314]] you— [[G4771]] indeed [[G3303]] I, [[G1473]] Paul, [[G3972]] [tried] [[G2532]] again [[G530]] and [[G2532]] again— [[G1364]] but [[G2532]] Satan [[G4567]] obstructed [[G1465]] us. [[G1473]]

### 19
After all, [[G1063]] who [is] [[G5101]] our [[G1473]] hope, [[G1680]] [our] [[G2228]] joy, [[G5479]] [our] [[G2228]] crown [[G4735]] of boasting, [[G2746]] if it is [[G2228]] not [[G3780]] you yourselves [[G4771]] in the presence of [[G1715]] our [[G1473]] Lord [[G2962]] Jesus [[G2424]] at [[G1722]] His [[G846]] coming? [[G3952]]

### 20
You [[G4771]] are [[G1510]] indeed [[G1063]] our [[G1473]] glory [[G1391]] and [[G2532]] [our] [[G3588]] joy. [[G5479]]
