### 1
My son, [[H1121]] pay attention [[H7181]] to my wisdom; [[H2451]] incline [[H5186]] your ear [[H241]] to my understanding, [[H8394]]

### 2
that you may maintain [[H8104]] discretion [[H4209]] and your lips [[H8193]] may preserve [[H5341]] knowledge. [[H1847]]

### 3
Though [[H3588]] the lips [[H8193]] of the forbidden woman [[H2114]] drip [[H5197]] honey [[H5317]] and her speech [[H2441]] [is] smoother [[H2509]] than oil, [[H8081]]

### 4
her end [[H319]] is bitter [[H4751]] as wormwood, [[H3939]] sharp [[H2299]] as a double-edged [[H6310]] sword. [[H2719]]

### 5
Her feet [[H7272]] go down [[H3381]] to death; [[H4194]] her steps [[H6806]] lead straight [[H8551]] to Sheol. [[H7585]]

### 6
She does not [[H6435]] consider [[H6424]] the path [[H734]] of life; [[H2416]] she does not [[H3808]] know that [[H3045]] her ways [[H4570]] are unstable. [[H5128]]

### 7
So now, [[H6258]] my sons, [[H1121]] listen to me, [[H8085]] and do not [[H408]] turn aside [[H5493]] from the words [[H561]] of my mouth. [[H6310]]

### 8
Keep your path [[H1870]] far [[H7368]] from her; [[H5921]] do not [[H408]] go near [[H7126]] the door [[H6607]] of her house, [[H1004]]

### 9
lest [[H6435]] you concede [[H5414]] your vigor [[H1935]] to others, [[H312]] and your years [[H8141]] to one who is cruel, [[H394]]

### 10
lest [[H6435]] strangers [[H2114]] feast [[H7646]] on your wealth, [[H3581]] and your labors [[H6089]] [enrich] the house [[H1004]] of a foreigner. [[H5237]]

### 11
At the end of your life [[H319]] you will groan [[H5098]] when your flesh [[H1320]] and your body [[H7607]] are spent, [[H3615]]

### 12
and you will say, [[H559]] “How [[H349]] I hated [[H8130]] discipline, [[H4148]] and my heart [[H3820]] despised [[H5006]] reproof! [[H8433]]

### 13
I did not [[H3808]] listen [[H8085]] to the voice [[H6963]] of my teachers [[H3384]] [or] [[H3808]] incline [[H5186]] my ear [[H241]] to my mentors. [[H3925]]

### 14
I am [[H1961]] on the brink [[H4592]] of utter [[H3605]] ruin [[H7451]] in the midst [[H8432]] of the whole assembly.” [[H6951]]

### 15
Drink [[H8354]] water [[H4325]] from your own cistern, [[H953]] and running water [[H5140]] out of [[H8432]] your own well. [[H875]]

### 16
Why should your springs [[H4599]] flow [[H6327]] in the streets, [[H2351]] your streams [[H6388]] of water [[H4325]] in the public squares? [[H7339]]

### 17
Let them be [[H1961]] yours  alone, [[H905]] never [[H369]] to be shared [[H854]] with strangers. [[H2114]]

### 18
May your fountain [[H4726]] be [[H1961]] blessed, [[H1288]] and may you rejoice [[H8055]] in the wife [[H802]] of your youth: [[H5271]]

### 19
A loving [[H158]] doe, [[H365]] a graceful [[H2580]] fawn— [[H3280]] may her breasts [[H1717]] satisfy you [[H7301]] always; [[H3605]] may you be captivated [[H7686]] by her love [[H160]] forever. [[H8548]]

### 20
Why [[H4100]] be captivated, [[H7686]] my son, [[H1121]] by an adulteress, [[H2114]] or embrace [[H2263]] the bosom [[H2436]] of a stranger? [[H5237]]

### 21
For [[H3588]] a man’s [[H376]] ways [[H1870]] are before [[H5227]] the eyes [[H5869]] of the LORD, [[H3069]] and [the Lord] watches [[H6424]] all [[H3605]] his paths. [[H4570]]

### 22
The iniquities [[H5771]] of a wicked man [[H7563]] entrap him; [[H3920]] the cords [[H2256]] of his own sin [[H2403]] entangle him. [[H8551]]

### 23
He [[H1931]] will die [[H4191]] for lack [[H369]] of discipline, [[H4148]] led astray [[H7686]] by his own great [[H7230]] folly. [[H200]]
