# Proverbs 22

[[Proverbs 21|←]] • [[Proverbs 23|→]]

---

###### 1
A good name [[H8034]] is more desirable [[H977]] than great [[H7227]] riches; [[H6239]] favor [[H2580]] is better [[H2896]] than silver [[H3701]] and gold. [[H2091]]

###### 2
The rich [[H6223]] and the poor [[H7326]] have this in common: [[H6298]] the LORD [[H3068]] [is] the maker [[H6213]] of all. [[H3605]]

###### 3
The prudent [[H6175]] see [[H7200]] danger [[H7451]] and take cover, [[H5641]] but the simple [[H6612]] keep going [[H5674]] and suffer the consequences. [[H6064]]

###### 4
The rewards [[H6118]] of humility [[H6038]] [and] the fear [[H3374]] of the LORD [[H3068]] [are] wealth [[H6239]] and honor [[H3519]] and life. [[H2416]]

###### 5
Thorns [[H6791]] and snares [[H6341]] [lie] on the path [[H1870]] of the perverse; [[H6141]] he who guards [[H8104]] his soul [[H5315]] stays far [[H7368]] from them. [[H1992]]

###### 6
Train up [[H2596]] a child [[H5288]] in [[H5921]] the way [[H1870]] he should go, [[H6310]] and [[H1571]] when [[H3588]] he is old [[H2204]] he will not [[H3808]] depart [[H5493]] from it. [[H4480]]

###### 7
The rich [[H6223]] rule [[H4910]] over the poor, [[H7326]] and the borrower [[H3867]] is slave [[H5650]] to the lender. [[H3867]]

###### 8
He who sows [[H2232]] injustice [[H5766]] will reap disaster, [[H7114]] and the rod [[H7626]] of his fury [[H5678]] will be destroyed. [[H3615]]

###### 9
A generous [man] [[H2896]] will be blessed, [[H1288]] for [[H3588]] he shares [[H5414]] his food [[H3899]] with the poor. [[H1800]]

###### 10
Drive out [[H1644]] the mocker, [[H3887]] and conflict [[H4066]] will depart; [[H3318]] even quarreling [[H1779]] and insults [[H7036]] will cease. [[H7673]]

###### 11
He who loves [[H157]] a pure heart [[H2889]] and gracious [[H2580]] lips [[H8193]] [will have] the king [[H4428]] for a friend. [[H7453]]

###### 12
The LORD’s [[H3068]] eyes [[H5869]] keep watch over [[H5341]] knowledge, [[H1847]] but He frustrates [[H5557]] the words [[H1697]] of the faithless. [[H898]]

###### 13
The sluggard [[H6102]] says, [[H559]] “[There is] a lion [[H738]] outside! [[H2351]] I will be slain [[H7523]] in [[H8432]] the streets!” [[H7339]]

###### 14
The mouth [[H6310]] of an adulteress [[H2114]] is a deep [[H6013]] pit; [[H7745]] he who is cursed [[H2194]] by the LORD [[H3068]] will fall [[H5307]] into it. [[H5307]]

###### 15
Foolishness [[H200]] [is] bound up [[H7194]] in the heart [[H3820]] of a child, [[H5288]] [but] the rod [[H7626]] of discipline [[H4148]] will drive it far [[H7368]] from him. [[H4480]]

###### 16
Oppressing [[H6231]] the poor [[H1800]] to enrich oneself, [[H7235]] or giving gifts [[H5414]] to the rich, [[H6223]] [will] surely lead [[H389]] to poverty. [[H4270]]

###### 17
Incline [[H5186]] your ear [[H241]] and hear [[H8085]] the words [[H1697]] of the wise— [[H2450]] apply [[H7896]] your mind [[H3820]] to my knowledge— [[H1847]]

###### 18
for [[H3588]] it is pleasing [[H5273]] when [[H3588]] you keep [[H8104]] them within you [[H990]] and they are constantly [[H3162]] on [[H5921]] your lips. [[H8193]]

###### 19
So that your trust [[H4009]] may be [[H1961]] in the LORD, [[H3068]] I have instructed you [[H3045]] today, [[H3117]] even [[H637]] you. [[H859]]

###### 20
Have I not [[H3808]] written [[H3789]] for you  thirty sayings [[H8032]] about counsel [[H4156]] and knowledge, [[H1847]]

###### 21
to show you [[H3045]] TRUE [[H7189]] and reliable [[H571]] words, [[H561]] so that you can give [[H7725]] sound [[H571]] answers [[H561]] to those who sent you? [[H7971]]

###### 22
Do not [[H408]] rob [[H1497]] a poor [[H1800]] man because [[H3588]] he [[H1931]] is poor, [[H1800]] and do not [[H408]] crush [[H1792]] the afflicted [[H6041]] at the gate, [[H8179]]

###### 23
for [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3069]] will take up [[H7378]] their case [[H7379]] and will plunder [[H6906]] those who rob them. [[H6906]]

###### 24
Do not [[H408]] make friends [[H7462]] with [[H854]] an angry [[H639]] man, [[H1167]] and do not [[H3808]] associate [[H935]] with [[H854]] a hot-tempered [[H2534]] man, [[H376]]

###### 25
or [[H6435]] you may learn [[H502]] his ways [[H734]] and entangle [[H3947]] yourself [[H5315]] in a snare. [[H4170]]

###### 26
Do not [[H408]] be [[H1961]] one who gives pledges, [[H8628]] who puts up security [[H6148]] for debts. [[H4859]]

###### 27
If [[H518]] you have nothing [[H369]] with which  to pay, [[H7999]] why [[H4100]] should your bed [[H4904]] be taken [[H3947]] from under you? [[H8478]]

###### 28
Do not [[H408]] move [[H5253]] an ancient [[H5769]] boundary stone [[H1366]] which [[H834]] your fathers [[H1]] have set. [[H6213]]

###### 29
Do you see [[H2372]] a man [[H376]] skilled [[H4106]] in his work? [[H4399]] He will be stationed [[H3320]] in the presence [[H6440]] of kings; [[H4428]] he will not [[H1077]] stand [[H3320]] before [[H6440]] obscure men. [[H2823]]
