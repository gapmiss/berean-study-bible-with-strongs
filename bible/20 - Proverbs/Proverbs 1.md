### 1
The proverbs [[H4912]] of Solomon [[H8010]] son [[H1121]] of David, [[H1732]] king [[H4428]] of Israel: [[H3478]]

### 2
To know [[H3045]] wisdom [[H2451]] and discipline, [[H4148]] to comprehend [[H995]] the words [[H561]] of insight, [[H998]]

### 3
to receive [[H3947]] instruction [[H4148]] in wise living, [[H7919]] in righteousness, [[H6664]] justice, [[H4941]] and equity, [[H4339]]

### 4
to impart [[H5414]] prudence [[H6195]] to the simple, [[H6612]] knowledge [[H1847]] and discretion [[H4209]] to the young— [[H5288]]

### 5
{let} the wise [[H2450]] listen [[H8085]] and gain [[H3254]] instruction, [[H3948]] and the discerning [[H995]] acquire [[H7069]] wise counsel— [[H8458]]

### 6
to understand [[H995]] the proverbs [[H4912]] and parables, [[H4426]] the sayings [[H1697]] and riddles [[H2420]] of the wise. [[H2450]]

### 7
The fear [[H3374]] of the LORD [[H3068]] [is] the beginning [[H7225]] of knowledge, [[H1847]] [but] fools [[H191]] despise [[H936]] wisdom [[H2451]] and discipline. [[H4148]]

### 8
Listen, [[H8085]] my son, [[H1121]] to your father’s [[H1]] instruction, [[H4148]] and do not forsake [[H5203]] the teaching [[H8451]] of your mother. [[H517]]

### 9
For [[H3588]] they [[H1992]] [are] a garland [[H3880]] of grace [[H2580]] on your head, [[H7218]] and a pendant [[H6060]] around your neck. [[H1621]]

### 10
My son, [[H1121]] if [[H518]] sinners [[H2400]] entice you, [[H6601]] do not [[H408]] yield [to them]. [[H14]]

### 11
If [[H518]] they say, [[H559]] “Come [[H1980]] along, [[H854]] let us lie in wait [[H693]] for blood, [[H1818]] let us ambush [[H6845]] the innocent [[H5355]] without cause, [[H2600]]

### 12
let us swallow them [[H1104]] alive [[H2416]] like Sheol, [[H7585]] and whole [[H8549]] like those descending [[H3381]] into the Pit. [[H953]]

### 13
We {will} find [[H4672]] all manner [[H3605]] of precious [[H3368]] goods; [[H1952]] we {will} fill [[H4390]] our houses [[H1004]] with plunder. [[H7998]]

### 14
Throw in [[H5307]] your lot [[H1486]] with us, [[H8432]] let us all [[H3605]] have [[H1961]] one [[H259]] purse”— [[H3599]]

### 15
my son, [[H1121]] do not [[H408]] walk [[H1980]] the road [[H1870]] with them [[H854]] or set [[H4513]] foot [[H7272]] upon their path. [[H5410]]

### 16
For [[H3588]] their feet [[H7272]] run [[H7323]] to evil, [[H7451]] and they are swift [[H4116]] to shed [[H8210]] blood. [[H1818]]

### 17
How [[H3588]] futile [[H2600]] to spread [[H2219]] the net [[H7568]] where any [[H3605]] bird [[H1167]] can see it. [[H5869]]

### 18
But they [[H1992]] lie in wait [[H693]] for their [own] blood; [[H1818]] they ambush [[H6845]] their [own] lives. [[H5315]]

### 19
Such [is] [[H3651]] the fate [[H734]] of all [[H3605]] who are greedy, [[H1214]] whose unjust gain [[H1215]] takes [[H3947]] the lives [[H5315]] of its possessors. [[H1167]]

### 20
Wisdom [[H2454]] calls out [[H7442]] in the street, [[H2351]] she lifts [[H5414]] her voice [[H6963]] in the square, [[H7339]]

### 21
in the main [[H7218]] concourse [[H1993]] she cries aloud, [[H7121]] at the city [[H5892]] gates [[H8179]] she makes [[H559]] her speech: [[H561]]

### 22
“How [[H5704]] long, [[H4970]] O simple ones, [[H6612]] will you love [[H157]] simplicity? [[H6612]] How long will scoffers [[H3887]] delight [[H2530]] in their scorn [[H3944]] and fools [[H3684]] hate [[H8130]] knowledge? [[H1847]]

### 23
If you had repented [[H7725]] at my rebuke, [[H8433]] then surely [[H2009]] I would have poured out [[H5042]] my  spirit on you; [[H7307]] I would have made [[H3045]] my words [[H1697]] known to you. [[H853]]

### 24
Because [[H3282]] you refused [[H3985]] my call, [[H7121]] and no one [[H369]] took [[H7181]] my outstretched [[H5186]] hand, [[H3027]]

### 25
because you neglected [[H6544]] all [[H3605]] my counsel, [[H6098]] and wanted [[H14]] none [[H3808]] of my correction, [[H8433]]

### 26
in turn [[H1571]] I [[H589]] will mock [[H7832]] your calamity; [[H343]] I will sneer [[H3932]] when terror [[H6343]] strikes you, [[H935]]

### 27
when your dread [[H6343]] comes [[H935]] like a storm, [[H7584]] and your destruction [[H343]] like a whirlwind, [[H5492]] when distress [[H6869]] and anguish [[H6695]] overwhelm you. [[H935]]

### 28
Then [[H227]] they will call on me, [[H7121]] but I will not [[H3808]] answer; [[H6030]] they {will} earnestly seek me, [[H7836]] but {will} not [[H3808]] find me. [[H4672]]

### 29
For [[H3588]] they hated [[H8130]] knowledge [[H1847]] and chose [[H977]] not [[H3808]] to fear [[H3374]] the LORD. [[H3068]]

### 30
They accepted [[H14]] none [[H3808]] of my counsel; [[H6098]] they despised [[H5006]] all [[H3605]] my reproof. [[H8433]]

### 31
So they {will} eat [[H398]] the fruit [[H6529]] of their own way, [[H1870]] and be filled [[H7646]] with their own devices. [[H4156]]

### 32
For [[H3588]] the waywardness [[H4878]] of the simple [[H6612]] {will} slay them, [[H2026]] and the complacency [[H7962]] of fools [[H3684]] {will} destroy them. [[H6]]

### 33
But whoever listens [[H8085]] to me  {will} dwell [[H7931]] in safety, [[H983]] secure [[H7599]] from the fear [[H6343]] of evil.” [[H7451]]
