# Proverbs 12

[[Proverbs 11|←]] • [[Proverbs 13|→]]

---

### 1
Whoever loves [[H157]] discipline [[H4148]] loves [[H157]] knowledge, [[H1847]] but he who hates [[H8130]] correction [[H8433]] is stupid. [[H1197]]

### 2
The good [man] [[H2896]] obtains [[H6329]] favor [[H7522]] from the LORD, [[H3069]] but [the LORD] condemns [[H7561]] a man [[H376]] who devises evil. [[H4209]]

### 3
A man [[H120]] cannot [[H3808]] be established [[H3559]] through wickedness, [[H7562]] but the righteous [[H6662]] cannot [[H1077]] be uprooted. [[H4131]]

### 4
A wife [[H802]] of noble character [[H2428]] is her husband’s [[H1167]] crown, [[H5850]] but she who causes shame [[H954]] is like decay [[H7538]] in his bones. [[H6106]]

### 5
The plans [[H4284]] of the righteous [[H6662]] are just, [[H4941]] [but] the counsel [[H8458]] of the wicked [[H7563]] leads to deceit. [[H4820]]

### 6
The words [[H1697]] of the wicked [[H7563]] lie in wait [[H693]] for blood, [[H1818]] but the speech [[H6310]] of the upright [[H3477]] rescues them. [[H5337]]

### 7
The wicked [[H7563]] are overthrown [[H2015]] and perish, [[H369]] but the house [[H1004]] of the righteous [[H6662]] will stand. [[H5975]]

### 8
A man [[H376]] is praised [[H1984]] according [[H6310]] to his wisdom, [[H7922]] but a twisted [[H5753]] mind [[H3820]] is [[H1961]] despised. [[H937]]

### 9
Better [[H2896]] to be lightly esteemed, [[H7034]] yet have a servant, [[H5650]] than to be self-important [[H3513]] but lack [[H2638]] food. [[H3899]]

### 10
A righteous [man] [[H6662]] regards [[H3045]] the life [[H5315]] of his animal, [[H929]] but the tender mercies [[H7356]] of the wicked [[H7563]] are only cruelty. [[H394]]

### 11
He who works [[H5647]] his land [[H127]] will have plenty of [[H7646]] food, [[H3899]] but whoever chases [[H7291]] fantasies [[H7386]] lacks [[H2638]] judgment. [[H3820]]

### 12
The wicked [[H7563]] desire [[H2530]] the plunder [[H4685]] of evil men, [[H7451]] but the root [[H8328]] of the righteous [[H6662]] flourishes. [[H5414]]

### 13
An evil [[H7451]] man is trapped [[H4170]] by his rebellious [[H6588]] speech, [[H8193]] but a righteous man [[H6662]] escapes [[H3318]] from trouble. [[H6869]]

### 14
By fruitful [[H6529]] speech [[H6310]] a man [[H376]] will be filled [[H7646]] with good things, [[H2896]] and the work [[H1576]] of a man’s [[H120]] hands [[H3027]] will reward him. [[H7725]]

### 15
The way [[H1870]] of a fool [[H191]] [is] right [[H3477]] in his own eyes, [[H5869]] but a wise [man] [[H2450]] listens [[H8085]] to counsel. [[H6098]]

### 16
A fool’s [[H191]] anger [[H3708]] is known [[H3045]] at once, [[H3117]] but a prudent [man] [[H6175]] overlooks [[H3680]] an insult. [[H7036]]

### 17
[He who] speaks [[H6315]] the truth [[H530]] declares [[H5046]] what is right, [[H6664]] but a false [[H8267]] witness [[H5707]] [speaks] deceit. [[H4820]]

### 18
Speaking rashly [[H981]] is like a piercing [[H4094]] sword, [[H2719]] but the tongue [[H3956]] of the wise [[H2450]] brings healing. [[H4832]]

### 19
Truthful [[H571]] lips [[H8193]] endure forever, [[H3559]] but a lying [[H8267]] tongue [[H3956]] [lasts] only [[H5704]] a moment. [[H7281]]

### 20
Deceit [[H4820]] is in the hearts [[H3820]] of those who devise [[H2790]] evil, [[H7451]] but the counselors [[H3289]] of peace [[H7965]] have joy. [[H8057]]

### 21
No [[H3808]] harm [[H205]] befalls [[H579]] the righteous, [[H6662]] but the wicked [[H7563]] are filled [[H4390]] with trouble. [[H7451]]

### 22
Lying [[H8267]] lips [[H8193]] are detestable [[H8441]] to the LORD, [[H3068]] but those who deal [[H6213]] faithfully [[H530]] are His delight. [[H7522]]

### 23
A shrewd [[H6175]] man [[H120]] keeps [[H3680]] his knowledge {to himself}, [[H1847]] but a foolish [[H3684]] heart [[H3820]] proclaims [[H7121]] its folly. [[H200]]

### 24
The hand [[H3027]] of the diligent [[H2742]] will rule, [[H4910]] but laziness [[H7423]] ends in [[H1961]] forced labor. [[H4522]]

### 25
Anxiety [[H1674]] weighs down [[H7812]] the heart [[H3820]] of a man, [[H376]] but a good [[H2896]] word [[H1697]] cheers it up. [[H8055]]

### 26
A righteous man [[H6662]] is cautious [[H8446]] in friendship, [[H7453]] but the ways [[H1870]] of the wicked [[H7563]] lead them astray. [[H8582]]

### 27
A lazy [[H7423]] man does not [[H3808]] roast [[H2760]] his game, [[H6718]] but a diligent [[H2742]] man [[H120]] prizes [[H3368]] his possession. [[H1952]]

### 28
There is life [[H2416]] in the path [[H734]] of righteousness, [[H6666]] but another path [[H1870]] leads to death. [[H4194]]
