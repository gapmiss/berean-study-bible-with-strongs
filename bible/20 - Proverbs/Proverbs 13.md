# Proverbs 13

[[Proverbs 12|←]] • [[Proverbs 14|→]]

---

###### 1
A wise [[H2450]] son [[H1121]] [heeds] his father’s [[H1]] discipline, [[H4148]] but a mocker [[H3887]] does not [[H3808]] listen [[H8085]] to rebuke. [[H1606]]

###### 2
From the fruit [[H6529]] of his lips [[H6310]] a man [[H376]] will enjoy [[H398]] good things, [[H2896]] but the desire [[H5315]] of the faithless [[H898]] is violence. [[H2555]]

###### 3
He who guards [[H5341]] his mouth [[H6310]] protects [[H8104]] his life, [[H5315]] [but] the one who opens [[H6589]] his lips [[H8193]] invites his own ruin. [[H4288]]

###### 4
The slacker [[H6102]] craves, [[H183]] yet [gets] nothing, [[H369]] but the soul [[H5315]] of the diligent [[H2742]] is fully satisfied. [[H1878]]

###### 5
The righteous [[H6662]] hate [[H8130]] falsehood, [[H1697]] but the wicked [[H7563]] bring shame [[H887]] and disgrace. [[H2659]]

###### 6
Righteousness [[H6666]] guards [[H5341]] the man of integrity, [[H8537]] but wickedness [[H7564]] undermines [[H5557]] the sinner. [[H2403]]

###### 7
One pretends to be rich, [[H6238]] but has nothing; [[H369]] another pretends to be poor, [[H7326]] yet has great [[H7227]] wealth. [[H1952]]

###### 8
Riches [[H6239]] may ransom [[H3724]] a man’s [[H376]] life, [[H5315]] but a poor [[H7326]] man hears [[H8085]] no [[H3808]] threat. [[H1606]]

###### 9
The light [[H216]] of the righteous [[H6662]] shines brightly, [[H8055]] but the lamp [[H5216]] of the wicked [[H7563]] is extinguished. [[H1846]]

###### 10
Arrogance [[H2087]] leads [[H5414]] only [[H7535]] to strife, [[H4683]] but wisdom [[H2451]] is with [[H854]] the well-advised. [[H3289]]

###### 11
Dishonest [[H1892]] wealth [[H1952]] will dwindle, [[H4591]] but what is earned [[H6908]] through [[H5921]] hard work [[H3027]] will be multiplied. [[H7235]]

###### 12
Hope [[H8431]] deferred [[H4900]] makes the heart [[H3820]] sick, [[H2470]] but desire [[H8378]] fulfilled [[H935]] is a tree [[H6086]] of life. [[H2416]]

###### 13
He who despises [[H936]] instruction [[H1697]] will pay the penalty, [[H2254]] but the one who respects [[H3373]] a command [[H4687]] will be rewarded. [[H7999]]

###### 14
The teaching [[H8451]] of the wise [[H2450]] is a fountain [[H4726]] of life, [[H2416]] turning one [[H5493]] from the snares [[H4170]] of death. [[H4194]]

###### 15
Good [[H2896]] understanding [[H7922]] wins [[H5414]] favor, [[H2580]] but the way [[H1870]] of the faithless [[H898]] is difficult. [[H386]]

###### 16
Every [[H3605]] prudent [man] [[H6175]] acts [[H6213]] with knowledge, [[H1847]] but a fool [[H3684]] displays [[H6566]] [his] folly. [[H200]]

###### 17
A wicked [[H7563]] messenger [[H4397]] falls [[H5307]] into trouble, [[H7451]] but a faithful [[H529]] envoy [[H6735]] brings healing. [[H4832]]

###### 18
Poverty [[H7389]] and shame [[H7036]] come to him who ignores [[H6544]] discipline, [[H4148]] but whoever heeds [[H8104]] correction [[H8433]] will be honored. [[H3513]]

###### 19
Desire [[H8378]] fulfilled [[H1961]] is sweet [[H6149]] to the soul, [[H5315]] but turning [[H5493]] from evil [[H7451]] is detestable [[H8441]] to fools. [[H3684]]

###### 20
He who walks [[H1980]] with [[H854]] the wise [[H2450]] will become wise, [[H2449]] but the companion [[H7462]] of fools [[H3684]] will be destroyed. [[H7321]]

###### 21
Disaster [[H7451]] pursues [[H7291]] sinners, [[H2400]] but prosperity [[H2896]] is the reward [[H7999]] of the righteous. [[H6662]]

###### 22
A good [[H2896]] man leaves an inheritance [[H5157]] to his children’s [[H1121]] children, [[H1121]] but the sinner’s [[H2398]] wealth [[H2428]] [is] passed [[H6845]] to the righteous. [[H6662]]

###### 23
Abundant [[H7230]] food [[H400]] [is in] the fallow ground [[H5215]] of the poor, [[H7326]] but without [[H3808]] justice [[H4941]] it is [[H3426]] swept away. [[H5595]]

###### 24
He who spares [[H2820]] the rod [[H7626]] hates [[H8130]] his son, [[H1121]] but he who loves him [[H157]] disciplines him [[H4148]] diligently. [[H7836]]

###### 25
A righteous [[H6662]] man eats [[H398]] to his heart’s [[H5315]] content, [[H7648]] but the stomach [[H990]] of the wicked [[H7563]] is empty. [[H2637]]
