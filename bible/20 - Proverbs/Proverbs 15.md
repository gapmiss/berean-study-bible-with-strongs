# Proverbs 15

[[Proverbs 14|←]] • [[Proverbs 16|→]]

---

### 1
A gentle [[H7390]] answer [[H4617]] turns away [[H7725]] wrath, [[H2534]] but a harsh [[H6089]] word [[H1697]] stirs up [[H5927]] anger. [[H639]]

### 2
The tongue [[H3956]] of the wise [[H2450]] commends [[H3190]] knowledge, [[H1847]] but the mouth [[H6310]] of the fool [[H3684]] spouts [[H5042]] folly. [[H200]]

### 3
The eyes [[H5869]] of the LORD [[H3068]] are in every [[H3605]] place, [[H4725]] observing [[H6822]] the evil [[H7451]] and the good. [[H2896]]

### 4
A soothing [[H4832]] tongue [[H3956]] is a tree [[H6086]] of life, [[H2416]] but a perverse [tongue] [[H5558]] crushes [[H7667]] the spirit. [[H7307]]

### 5
A fool [[H191]] rejects [[H5006]] his father’s [[H1]] discipline, [[H4148]] but whoever heeds [[H8104]] correction [[H8433]] is prudent. [[H6191]]

### 6
The house [[H1004]] of the righteous [[H6662]] has great [[H7227]] treasure, [[H2633]] but the income [[H8393]] of the wicked [[H7563]] is trouble. [[H5916]]

### 7
The lips [[H8193]] of the wise [[H2450]] spread [[H2219]] knowledge, [[H1847]] but not [[H3808]] so [[H3651]] the hearts [[H3820]] of fools. [[H3684]]

### 8
The sacrifice [[H2077]] of the wicked [[H7563]] is detestable [[H8441]] to the LORD, [[H3068]] but the prayer [[H8605]] of the upright [[H3477]] is His delight. [[H7522]]

### 9
The LORD [[H3068]] detests [[H8441]] the way [[H1870]] of the wicked, [[H7563]] but He loves [[H157]] those who pursue [[H7291]] righteousness. [[H6666]]

### 10
Discipline [[H4148]] is harsh [[H7451]] for him who leaves [[H5800]] the path; [[H734]] he who hates [[H8130]] correction [[H8433]] will die. [[H4191]]

### 11
Sheol [[H7585]] and Abaddon [[H11]] lie open before [[H5048]] the LORD— [[H3069]] how much more [[H637]] the hearts [[H3826]] of men! [[H120]]

### 12
A mocker [[H3887]] does not [[H3808]] love [[H157]] to be reproved, [[H3198]] nor will he [[H3808]] consult [[H413]] the wise. [[H2450]]

### 13
A joyful [[H8056]] heart [[H3820]] makes a cheerful [[H3190]] countenance, [[H6440]] but sorrow [[H6094]] of the heart [[H3820]] crushes [[H5218]] the spirit. [[H7307]]

### 14
A discerning [[H995]] heart [[H3820]] seeks [[H1245]] knowledge, [[H1847]] but the mouth [[H6440]] of a fool [[H3684]] feeds on [[H7462]] folly. [[H200]]

### 15
All [[H3605]] the days [[H3117]] of the oppressed [[H6041]] are bad, [[H7451]] but a cheerful [[H2896]] heart [[H3820]] has a continual [[H8548]] feast. [[H4960]]

### 16
Better [[H2896]] a little [[H4592]] with the fear [[H3374]] of the LORD [[H3068]] than great [[H7227]] treasure [[H214]] with turmoil. [[H4103]]

### 17
Better [[H2896]] a dish [[H737]] of vegetables [[H3419]] where [[H8033]] there is love [[H160]] than a fattened [[H75]] ox [[H7794]] with hatred. [[H8135]]

### 18
A hot-tempered [[H2534]] man [[H376]] stirs up [[H1624]] strife, [[H4066]] but he who is slow [[H750]] to anger [[H639]] calms [[H8252]] dispute. [[H7379]]

### 19
The way [[H1870]] of the sluggard [[H6102]] is like a hedge [[H4881]] of thorns, [[H2312]] but the path [[H734]] of the upright [[H3477]] is a highway. [[H5549]]

### 20
A wise [[H2450]] son [[H1121]] brings joy [[H8055]] to his father, [[H1]] but a foolish [[H3684]] man [[H120]] despises [[H959]] his mother. [[H517]]

### 21
Folly [[H200]] is joy [[H8057]] to one who lacks [[H2638]] judgment, [[H3820]] but a man [[H376]] of understanding [[H8394]] walks [[H1980]] a straight path. [[H3474]]

### 22
Plans [[H4284]] fail [[H6565]] for lack [[H369]] of counsel, [[H5475]] but with many [[H7230]] advisers [[H3289]] they succeed. [[H6965]]

### 23
A man [[H376]] takes joy [[H8057]] in a fitting reply, [[H4617]] and how [[H4100]] good is [[H2896]] a timely [[H6256]] word! [[H1697]]

### 24
The path [[H734]] of life [[H2416]] [leads] upward [[H4605]] for the wise, [[H7919]] that [[H4616]] he may avoid [[H5493]] going down [[H4295]] to Sheol. [[H7585]]

### 25
The LORD [[H3068]] tears down [[H5255]] the house [[H1004]] of the proud, [[H1343]] but He protects [[H5324]] the boundaries [[H1366]] of the widow. [[H490]]

### 26
The LORD [[H3068]] detests [[H8441]] the thoughts [[H4284]] of the wicked, [[H7451]] but the words [[H561]] of the pure [[H2889]] are pleasant [to Him]. [[H5278]]

### 27
He who is greedy [[H1214]] for unjust gain [[H1215]] brings trouble [[H5916]] on his household, [[H1004]] but he who hates [[H8130]] bribes [[H4979]] will live. [[H2421]]

### 28
The heart [[H3820]] of the righteous [[H6662]] ponders [[H1897]] how to answer, [[H6030]] but the mouth [[H6310]] of the wicked [[H7563]] blurts out [[H5042]] evil. [[H7451]]

### 29
The LORD [[H3068]] is far [[H7350]] from the wicked, [[H7563]] but He hears [[H8085]] the prayer [[H8605]] of the righteous. [[H6662]]

### 30
The light [[H3974]] of the eyes [[H5869]] cheers [[H8055]] the heart, [[H3820]] [and] good [[H2896]] news [[H8052]] nourishes [[H1878]] the bones. [[H6106]]

### 31
He who listens to [[H8085]] life-giving [[H2416]] reproof [[H8433]] will dwell [[H3885]] among [[H7130]] the wise. [[H2450]]

### 32
He who ignores [[H6544]] discipline [[H4148]] despises [[H3988]] himself, [[H5315]] but whoever heeds [[H8085]] correction [[H8433]] gains [[H7069]] understanding. [[H3820]]

### 33
The fear [[H3374]] of the LORD [[H3068]] [is] the instruction [[H4148]] of wisdom, [[H2451]] and humility [[H6038]] comes before [[H6440]] honor. [[H3519]]
