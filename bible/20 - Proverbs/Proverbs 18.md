# Proverbs 18

[[Proverbs 17|←]] • [[Proverbs 19|→]]

---

###### 1
He who isolates himself [[H6504]] pursues [[H1245]] selfish desires; [[H8378]] he rebels [[H1566]] against all [[H3605]] sound judgment. [[H8454]]

###### 2
A fool [[H3684]] does not [[H3808]] delight [[H2654]] in understanding, [[H8394]] but only [[H3588]] in airing [[H1540]] his opinions. [[H3820]]

###### 3
With a wicked [man] [[H7563]] comes [[H935]] contempt [[H937]] as well, [[H1571]] and shame [[H7036]] is accompanied by [[H5973]] disgrace. [[H2781]]

###### 4
The words [[H1697]] of a man’s [[H376]] mouth [[H6310]] are deep [[H6013]] waters; [[H4325]] the fountain [[H4726]] of wisdom [[H2451]] is a bubbling [[H5042]] brook. [[H5158]]

###### 5
Showing partiality [[H5375]] to the wicked [[H7563]] is not [[H3808]] good, [[H2896]] nor is depriving [[H5186]] the innocent [[H6662]] of justice. [[H4941]]

###### 6
A fool’s [[H3684]] lips [[H8193]] bring [[H935]] strife, [[H7379]] and his mouth [[H6310]] invites [[H7121]] a beating. [[H4112]]

###### 7
A fool’s [[H3684]] mouth [[H6310]] is his ruin, [[H4288]] and his lips [[H8193]] [are] a snare [[H4170]] to his soul. [[H5315]]

###### 8
A gossip’s [[H5372]] words [[H1697]] are like choice morsels, [[H3859]] and they [[H1992]] sink [[H3381]] into the inmost being. [[H2315]]

###### 9
Whoever [[H1571]] is slothful [[H7503]] in his work [[H4399]] is brother [[H251]] to him [[H1167]] who destroys. [[H7843]]

###### 10
The name [[H8034]] of the LORD [[H3069]] is a strong [[H5797]] tower; [[H4026]] the righteous [[H6662]] run to it [[H7323]] and are safe. [[H7682]]

###### 11
A rich [[H6223]] man’s wealth [[H1952]] is his fortified [[H5797]] city; [[H7151]] it is like a high [[H7682]] wall [[H2346]] in his imagination. [[H4906]]

###### 12
Before [[H6440]] his downfall [[H7667]] a man’s [[H376]] heart [[H3820]] is proud, [[H1361]] but humility [[H6038]] comes before [[H6440]] honor. [[H3519]]

###### 13
He who answers [[H7725]] a matter [[H1697]] before [[H2962]] he hears [it]— [[H8085]] this [[H1931]] [is] folly [[H200]] and disgrace [[H3639]] to him. 

###### 14
The spirit [[H7307]] of a man [[H376]] can endure [[H3557]] his sickness, [[H4245]] but who [[H4310]] can survive [[H5375]] a broken [[H5218]] spirit? [[H7307]]

###### 15
The heart [[H3820]] of the discerning [[H995]] acquires [[H7069]] knowledge, [[H1847]] and the ear [[H241]] of the wise [[H2450]] seeks [[H1245]] it out. [[H1847]]

###### 16
A man’s [[H120]] gift [[H4976]] opens doors [[H7337]] for him,  and brings [[H5148]] him before [[H6440]] great men. [[H1419]]

###### 17
The first [[H7223]] to state his case [[H7379]] seems right [[H6662]] until another [[H935]] comes forward [[H935]] and examines him. [[H2713]]

###### 18
Casting the lot [[H1486]] ends [[H7673]] quarrels [[H4079]] and separates [[H6504]] strong opponents. [[H6099]]

###### 19
An offended [[H6586]] brother [is harder to win] [[H251]] than a fortified [[H5797]] city, [[H7151]] and disputes [[H4066]] are like the bars [[H1280]] of a castle. [[H759]]

###### 20
From the fruit [[H6529]] of his mouth [[H6310]] a man’s [[H376]] belly [[H990]] is filled; [[H7646]] with the harvest [[H8393]] from his lips [[H8193]] he is satisfied. [[H7646]]

###### 21
Life [[H2416]] and death [[H4194]] are in the power [[H3027]] of the tongue, [[H3956]] and those who love [it] [[H157]] will eat [[H398]] its fruit. [[H6529]]

###### 22
He who finds [[H4672]] a wife [[H802]] finds [[H4672]] a good thing [[H2896]] and obtains [[H6329]] favor [[H7522]] from the LORD. [[H3068]]

###### 23
The poor man [[H7326]] pleads for mercy, [[H8469]] but the rich man [[H6223]] answers [[H6030]] harshly. [[H5794]]

###### 24
A man [[H376]] of many companions [[H7453]] may come to ruin, [[H7489]] but there is [[H3426]] a friend [[H157]] who stays closer [[H1695]] than a brother. [[H251]]
