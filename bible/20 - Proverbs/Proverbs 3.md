### 1
My son, [[H1121]] do not [[H408]] forget [[H7911]] my teaching, [[H8451]] but let your heart [[H3820]] keep [[H5341]] my commandments; [[H4687]]

### 2
for [[H3588]] they will add [[H3254]] length [[H753]] to your  days, [[H3117]] years [[H8141]] and peace [[H7965]] to your life. [[H2416]]

### 3
Never [[H408]] let loving devotion [[H2617]] or faithfulness [[H571]] leave you; [[H5800]] bind [[H7194]] them [[H5921]] around your neck, [[H1621]] write [[H3789]] them on [[H5921]] the tablet [[H3871]] of your heart. [[H3820]]

### 4
Then you will find [[H4672]] favor [[H2580]] and high regard [[H7922]] in the sight [[H5869]] of God [[H430]] and man. [[H120]]

### 5
Trust [[H982]] in [[H413]] the LORD [[H3068]] with all [[H3605]] your heart, [[H3820]] and lean [[H8172]] not [[H408]] on [[H413]] your own understanding; [[H998]]

### 6
in all [[H3605]] your ways [[H1870]] acknowledge Him, [[H3045]] and He [[H1931]] will make [[H3474]] your paths {straight}. [[H734]]

### 7
Do not [[H408]] be [[H1961]] wise [[H2450]] in your own eyes; [[H5869]] fear [[H3372]] the LORD [[H3069]] and turn away [[H5493]] from evil. [[H7451]]

### 8
This will bring [[H1961]] healing [[H7500]] to your body [[H8270]] and refreshment [[H8250]] to your bones. [[H6106]]

### 9
Honor [[H3513]] the LORD [[H3068]] with your wealth [[H1952]] and with the firstfruits [[H7225]] of all [[H3605]] your harvest; [[H8393]]

### 10
then your barns [[H618]] will be filled [[H4390]] with plenty, [[H7647]] and your vats [[H3342]] will overflow [[H6555]] with new wine. [[H8492]]

### 11
My son, [[H1121]] do not [[H408]] despise [[H3988]] the LORD’s [[H3068]] discipline [[H4148]] and do not [[H408]] loathe [[H6973]] His reproof; [[H8433]]

### 12
for [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] disciplines [[H3198]] those [[H834]] He loves, [[H157]] as a father [[H1]] the son [[H1121]] [in whom] he delights. [[H7521]]

### 13
Blessed [[H835]] [is] the man [[H120]] who finds [[H4672]] wisdom, [[H2451]] the man [[H120]] who acquires [[H6329]] understanding, [[H8394]]

### 14
for [[H3588]] she is more [[H2896]] profitable [[H5504]] than silver, [[H3701]] and her gain [is better] [[H8393]] than fine gold. [[H2742]]

### 15
She [[H1931]] is more precious [[H3368]] than rubies; [[H6443]] nothing [[H3605]] you desire [[H2656]] compares [[H7737]] with her. 

### 16
Long [[H753]] life [[H3117]] is in her right hand; [[H3225]] in her left hand [[H8040]] [are] riches [[H6239]] and honor. [[H3519]]

### 17
Her ways [[H1870]] are pleasant, [[H5278]] and all [[H3605]] her paths [[H5410]] [are] peaceful. [[H7965]]

### 18
She [[H1931]] is a tree [[H6086]] of life [[H2416]] to those who embrace her, [[H2388]] and those who lay hold of her [[H8551]] are blessed. [[H833]]

### 19
The LORD [[H3068]] founded [[H3245]] the earth [[H776]] by wisdom [[H2451]] and established [[H3559]] the heavens [[H8064]] by understanding. [[H8394]]

### 20
By His knowledge [[H1847]] the watery depths [[H8415]] were broken open, [[H1234]] and the clouds [[H7834]] dripped [[H7491]] with dew. [[H2919]]

### 21
My son, [[H1121]] do not [[H408]] lose [[H3868]] sight of this: [[H5869]] Preserve [[H5341]] sound judgment [[H8454]] and discernment. [[H4209]]

### 22
They will be [[H1961]] life [[H2416]] to your soul [[H5315]] and adornment [[H2580]] to your neck. [[H1621]]

### 23
Then [[H227]] you will go [[H1980]] on your way [[H1870]] in safety, [[H983]] and your foot [[H7272]] will not [[H3808]] stumble. [[H5062]]

### 24
When [[H518]] you lie down, [[H7901]] you will not [[H3808]] be afraid; [[H6342]] when you rest, [[H7901]] your sleep [[H8142]] will be sweet. [[H6149]]

### 25
Do not [[H408]] fear [[H3372]] sudden [[H6597]] danger [[H6343]] or the ruin [[H7722]] that [[H3588]] overtakes [[H935]] the wicked, [[H7563]]

### 26
for [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] will be [[H1961]] your confidence [[H3689]] and will keep [[H8104]] your foot [[H7272]] from the snare. [[H3921]]

### 27
Do not [[H408]] withhold [[H4513]] good [[H2896]] from those who deserve it, [[H1167]] when it is [[H1961]] within your [[H3027]] power [[H410]] to act. [[H6213]]

### 28
Do not [[H408]] tell [[H559]] your neighbor, [[H7453]] “Come [[H1980]] back [[H7725]] tomorrow— [[H4279]] I will provide [[H5414]] when you have the means.” [[H3426]]

### 29
Do not [[H408]] devise [[H2790]] evil [[H7451]] against [[H5921]] your neighbor, [[H7453]] for he [[H1931]] trustfully [[H983]] dwells [[H3427]] beside you. [[H854]]

### 30
Do not [[H408]] accuse [[H7378]] a man [[H120]] without cause, [[H2600]] when [[H518]] he has done [[H1580]] you no [[H3808]] harm. [[H7451]]

### 31
Do not [[H408]] envy [[H7065]] a violent [[H2555]] man [[H376]] or choose [[H977]] any [[H3605]] of his ways; [[H1870]]

### 32
for [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] detests [[H8441]] the perverse, [[H3868]] but He is a friend [[H5475]] to the upright. [[H3477]]

### 33
The curse [[H3994]] of the LORD [[H3068]] is on the house [[H1004]] of the wicked, [[H7563]] but He blesses [[H1288]] the home [[H5116]] of the righteous. [[H6662]]

### 34
He [[H1931]] mocks [[H3887]] those who mock, [[H3887]] but gives [[H5414]] grace [[H2580]] to the humble. [[H6041]]

### 35
The wise [[H2450]] will inherit [[H5157]] honor, [[H3519]] but fools [[H3684]] are held up [[H7311]] to shame. [[H7036]]
