# Proverbs 26

[[Proverbs 25|←]] • [[Proverbs 27|→]]

---

###### 1
Like snow [[H7950]] in summer [[H7019]] and rain [[H4306]] at harvest, [[H7105]] honor [[H3519]] does not [[H3808]] befit [[H5000]] a fool. [[H3684]]

###### 2
Like a fluttering [[H5110]] sparrow [[H6833]] or darting [[H5774]] swallow, [[H1866]] an undeserved [[H2600]] curse [[H7045]] does not [[H3808]] come to rest. [[H935]]

###### 3
A whip [[H7752]] for the horse, [[H5483]] a bridle [[H4964]] for the donkey, [[H2543]] and a rod [[H7626]] for the backs [[H1460]] of fools! [[H3684]]

###### 4
Do not [[H408]] answer [[H6030]] a fool [[H3684]] according to his folly, [[H200]] or [[H6435]] you yourself [[H859]] will be like him. [[H7737]]

###### 5
Answer [[H6030]] a fool [[H3684]] according to his folly, [[H200]] lest [[H6435]] he become [[H1961]] wise [[H2450]] in his own eyes. [[H5869]]

###### 6
Like cutting off [[H7096]] one’s own feet [[H7272]] or drinking [[H8354]] violence [[H2555]] is the sending [[H7971]] of a message [[H1697]] by the hand [[H3027]] of a fool. [[H3684]]

###### 7
Like lame [[H6455]] legs [[H7785]] hanging limp [[H1809]] is a proverb [[H4912]] in the mouth [[H6310]] of a fool. [[H3684]]

###### 8
Like binding [[H6887]] a stone [[H68]] into a sling [[H4773]] is [[H3651]] the giving [[H5414]] of honor [[H3519]] to a fool. [[H3684]]

###### 9
[Like] a thorn [[H2336]] [that] falls [[H5927]] into the hand [[H3027]] of a drunkard [[H7910]] is a proverb [[H4912]] in the mouth [[H6310]] of a fool. [[H3684]]

###### 10
Like an archer [[H7227]] who wounds [[H2342]] at random [[H3605]] is he who hires [[H7936]] a fool [[H3684]] or [[H7936]] passer-by. [[H5674]]

###### 11
As a dog [[H3611]] returns [[H7725]] to [[H5921]] its vomit, [[H6892]] so a fool [[H3684]] repeats [[H8138]] his folly. [[H200]]

###### 12
Do you see [[H7200]] a man [[H376]] who is wise [[H2450]] in his own eyes? [[H5869]] There is more hope [[H8615]] for a fool [[H3684]] than for him. [[H4480]]

###### 13
The slacker [[H6102]] says, [[H559]] “A lion [[H7826]] [is] in the road! [[H1870]] A fierce lion [[H738]] [roams] [[H996]] the public square!” [[H7339]]

###### 14
[As] a door [[H1817]] turns [[H5437]] on [[H5921]] its hinges, [[H6735]] so the sluggard [[H6102]] [turns] on [[H5921]] his bed. [[H4296]]

###### 15
The sluggard [[H6102]] buries [[H2934]] his hand [[H3027]] in the dish; [[H6747]] he is too lazy [[H3811]] to bring it back [[H7725]] to [[H413]] his mouth. [[H6310]]

###### 16
The sluggard [[H6102]] [is] wiser [[H2450]] in his own eyes [[H5869]] than seven men [[H7651]] who answer [[H7725]] discreetly. [[H2940]]

###### 17
Like one who grabs [[H2388]] a dog [[H3611]] by the ears [[H241]] is a passer-by [[H5674]] who meddles [[H5674]] in [[H5921]] a quarrel [[H7379]] not his own. [[H3808]]

###### 18
Like a madman [[H3856]] shooting [[H3384]] firebrands [[H2131]] and deadly [[H4194]] arrows, [[H2671]]

###### 19
so [[H3651]] is the man [[H376]] who deceives [[H7411]] his neighbor [[H7453]] and says, [[H559]] “I [[H589]] was only [[H3808]] joking!” [[H7832]]

###### 20
Without [[H657]] wood, [[H6086]] a fire [[H784]] goes out; [[H3518]] without [[H369]] gossip, [[H5372]] a conflict [[H4066]] ceases. [[H8367]]

###### 21
Like charcoal [[H6352]] for embers [[H1513]] and wood [[H6086]] for fire, [[H784]] so is a quarrelsome [[H4066]] man [[H376]] for kindling [[H2787]] strife. [[H7379]]

###### 22
The words [[H1697]] of a gossip [[H5372]] are like choice morsels [[H3859]] that [[H1992]] go down [[H3381]] to the inmost being. [[H2315]]

###### 23
Like glaze [[H3701]] covering [[H6823]] an earthen vessel [[H2789]] are burning [[H1814]] lips [[H8193]] and a wicked [[H7451]] heart. [[H3820]]

###### 24
A hateful man [[H8130]] disguises himself [[H5234]] with his speech, [[H8193]] but he lays up [[H7896]] deceit [[H4820]] in his heart. [[H7130]]

###### 25
When [[H3588]] he speaks [[H6963]] graciously, [[H2603]] do not [[H408]] believe him, [[H539]] for [[H3588]] seven [[H7651]] abominations [[H8441]] [fill] his heart. [[H3820]]

###### 26
Though his hatred [[H8135]] is concealed [[H3680]] by deception, [[H4860]] his wickedness [[H7451]] will be exposed [[H1540]] in the assembly. [[H6951]]

###### 27
He who digs [[H3738]] a pit [[H7845]] will fall into it, [[H5307]] and whoever rolls [[H1556]] a stone, [[H68]] it will come back [[H7725]] on him. [[H413]]

###### 28
A lying [[H8267]] tongue [[H3956]] hates [[H8130]] those it crushes, [[H1790]] and a flattering [[H2509]] mouth [[H6310]] causes [[H6213]] ruin. [[H4072]]
