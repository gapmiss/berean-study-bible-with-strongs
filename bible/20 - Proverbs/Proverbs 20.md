# Proverbs 20

[[Proverbs 19|←]] • [[Proverbs 21|→]]

---

### 1
Wine [[H3196]] is a mocker, [[H3887]] strong drink [[H7941]] is a brawler, [[H1993]] and whoever [[H3605]] is led astray [[H7686]] by them  is not [[H3808]] wise. [[H2449]]

### 2
The terror [[H367]] of a king [[H4428]] is like the roar [[H5099]] of a lion; [[H3715]] whoever provokes [him] [[H5674]] forfeits [[H2398]] his own life. [[H5315]]

### 3
It is honorable [[H3519]] for a man [[H376]] to resolve [[H7674]] a dispute, [[H7379]] but any [[H3605]] fool [[H191]] will quarrel. [[H1566]]

### 4
The sluggard [[H6102]] does not [[H3808]] plow [[H2790]] in season; [[H2779]] at harvest time [[H7105]] he looks, [[H7592]] but nothing is there. [[H369]]

### 5
The intentions [[H6098]] of a man’s [[H376]] heart [[H3820]] are deep [[H6013]] waters, [[H4325]] but a man [[H376]] of understanding [[H8394]] draws them out. [[H1802]]

### 6
Many [[H7230]] a man [[H120]] proclaims [[H7121]] his [[H376]] loving devotion, [[H2617]] but who [[H4310]] can find [[H4672]] a trustworthy [[H529]] man? [[H376]]

### 7
The righteous man [[H6662]] walks [[H1980]] with integrity; [[H8537]] blessed [are] [[H835]] his children [[H1121]] after him. [[H310]]

### 8
A king [[H4428]] who sits [[H3427]] on [[H5921]] a throne [[H3678]] to judge [[H1779]] sifts out [[H2219]] all [[H3605]] evil [[H7451]] with his eyes. [[H5869]]

### 9
Who [[H4310]] can say, [[H559]] “I have kept my heart [[H3820]] pure; [[H2135]] I am cleansed [[H2891]] from my sin”? [[H2403]]

### 10
Differing [[H68]] weights [[H68]] and unequal measures— [[H374]] both [[H8147]] are detestable [[H8441]] to the LORD. [[H3068]]

### 11
Even [[H1571]] a young man [[H5288]] is known [[H5234]] by his actions— [[H4611]] whether [[H518]] his conduct [[H6467]] is pure [[H2134]] and upright. [[H3477]]

### 12
Ears [[H241]] that hear [[H8085]] and eyes [[H5869]] that see— [[H7200]] the LORD [[H3068]] has made [[H6213]] them both. [[H8147]]

### 13
Do not [[H408]] love [[H157]] sleep, [[H8142]] or [[H6435]] you will grow poor; [[H3423]] open [[H6491]] your eyes, [[H5869]] [and] you will have plenty [[H7646]] of food. [[H3899]]

### 14
“Worthless, [[H7451]] worthless!” [[H7451]] says [[H559]] the buyer, [[H7069]] but on the way out, [[H235]] he gloats. [[H1984]]

### 15
There is [[H3426]] gold [[H2091]] and abundance [[H7230]] of rubies, [[H6443]] but lips [[H8193]] of knowledge [[H1847]] are a rare [[H3366]] treasure. [[H3627]]

### 16
Take [[H3947]] the garment [[H899]] of the one [[H3588]] who posts security [[H6148]] for a stranger; [[H2114]] get collateral [[H2254]] if it is for [[H1157]] a wayward woman. [[H5237]]

### 17
Food [[H3899]] gained by fraud [[H8267]] is sweet [[H6149]] to a man, [[H376]] but later [[H310]] his mouth [[H6310]] is full of [[H4390]] gravel. [[H2687]]

### 18
Set [[H3559]] plans [[H4284]] by consultation, [[H6098]] and wage [[H6213]] war [[H4421]] under sound guidance. [[H8458]]

### 19
He who reveals [[H1540]] secrets [[H5475]] is a constant [[H1980]] gossip; [[H7400]] avoid [[H6148]] the one who babbles [[H6601]] with his lips. [[H8193]]

### 20
Whoever curses [[H7043]] his father [[H1]] or mother, [[H517]] his lamp [[H5216]] will be extinguished [[H1846]] in deepest [[H380]] darkness. [[H2822]]

### 21
An inheritance [[H5159]] gained [[H973]] quickly [[H7223]] will not [[H3808]] be blessed [[H1288]] in the end. [[H319]]

### 22
Do not [[H408]] say, [[H559]] “I will avenge [[H7999]] this evil!” [[H7451]] Wait [[H6960]] on the LORD, [[H3068]] and He will deliver [[H3467]] you. 

### 23
Unequal weights [[H68]] are detestable [[H8441]] to the LORD, [[H3068]] and dishonest [[H4820]] scales [[H3976]] are no [[H3808]] good. [[H2896]]

### 24
A man’s [[H1397]] steps [[H4703]] [are] from the LORD, [[H3068]] so how [[H4100]] can anyone [[H120]] understand [[H995]] his own way? [[H1870]]

### 25
It is a trap [[H4170]] for a man [[H120]] to dedicate [[H6944]] something rashly [[H3216]] only later [[H310]] to reconsider [[H1239]] his vows. [[H5088]]

### 26
A wise [[H2450]] king [[H4428]] separates out [[H2219]] the wicked [[H7563]] and drives [[H7725]] the threshing wheel [[H212]] over them. [[H5921]]

### 27
The spirit [[H5397]] of a man [[H120]] [is] the lamp [[H5216]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] searching out [[H2664]] his inmost being. [[H2315]]

### 28
Loving devotion [[H2617]] and truth [[H571]] preserve [[H5341]] a king; [[H4428]] by these [[H2617]] he maintains [[H5582]] his throne. [[H3678]]

### 29
The glory [[H8597]] of young men [[H970]] is their strength, [[H3581]] and gray hair [[H7872]] is the splendor [[H1926]] of the old. [[H2205]]

### 30
Lashes [[H2250]] and wounds [[H6482]] scour [[H4838]] evil, [[H7451]] and beatings [[H4347]] cleanse the inmost parts. [[H2315]]
