# Proverbs 21

[[Proverbs 20|←]] • [[Proverbs 22|→]]

---

###### 1
The king’s [[H4428]] heart [[H3820]] is a waterway [[H6388]] in the hand [[H3027]] of the LORD; [[H3068]] He directs it [[H5186]] where [[H5921]] He pleases. [[H2654]]

###### 2
All [[H3605]] a man’s [[H376]] ways [[H1870]] seem [[H5869]] right to him, [[H3477]] but the LORD [[H3068]] weighs [[H8505]] the heart. [[H3826]]

###### 3
To do [[H6213]] righteousness [[H6666]] and justice [[H4941]] is more desirable [[H977]] to the LORD [[H3068]] than sacrifice. [[H2077]]

###### 4
Haughty [[H7311]] eyes [[H5869]] and a proud [[H7342]] heart— [[H3820]] the guides [[H5215]] of the wicked— [[H7563]] [are] sin. [[H2403]]

###### 5
The plans [[H4284]] of the diligent [[H2742]] bring plenty, [[H4195]] as surely [[H389]] as haste [leads] [[H213]] to poverty. [[H4270]]

###### 6
Making [[H6467]] a fortune [[H214]] by a lying [[H8267]] tongue [[H3956]] is a vanishing [[H5086]] mist, [[H1892]] a deadly [[H4194]] pursuit. [[H1245]]

###### 7
The violence [[H7701]] of the wicked [[H7563]] will sweep them away [[H1641]] because [[H3588]] they refuse [[H3985]] to do [[H6213]] what is just. [[H4941]]

###### 8
The way [[H1870]] of a guilty [[H2054]] man [[H376]] is crooked, [[H2019]] but the conduct [[H6467]] of the innocent [[H2134]] is upright. [[H3477]]

###### 9
Better [[H2896]] to live [[H3427]] on [[H5921]] a corner [[H6438]] of the roof [[H1406]] than to share [[H2267]] a house [[H1004]] with a quarrelsome [[H4079]] wife. [[H802]]

###### 10
The soul [[H5315]] of the wicked [[H7563]] craves [[H183]] evil; [[H7451]] his neighbor [[H7453]] finds no favor [[H2603]] in his eyes. [[H5869]]

###### 11
When a mocker [[H3887]] is punished, [[H6064]] the simple [[H6612]] gain wisdom; [[H2449]] and when a wise man [[H2450]] is instructed, [[H7919]] he acquires [[H3947]] knowledge. [[H1847]]

###### 12
The Righteous One [[H6662]] considers [[H7919]] the house [[H1004]] of the wicked; [[H7563]] He brings [[H5557]] the wicked [[H7563]] to ruin. [[H7451]]

###### 13
Whoever shuts [[H331]] his ears [[H241]] to the cry [[H2201]] of the poor, [[H1800]] he [[H1931]] too [[H1571]] shall cry out [[H7121]] and receive no answer. [[H6030]]

###### 14
A gift [[H4976]] in secret [[H5643]] soothes [[H3711]] anger, [[H639]] and a covert [[H2436]] bribe [[H7810]] [pacifies] great [[H5794]] wrath. [[H2534]]

###### 15
Justice [[H4941]] executed [[H6213]] is a joy [[H8057]] to the righteous, [[H6662]] but a terror [[H4288]] to the workers [[H6466]] of iniquity. [[H205]]

###### 16
The man [[H120]] who strays [[H8582]] from the path [[H1870]] of understanding [[H7919]] will rest [[H5117]] in the assembly [[H6951]] of the dead. [[H7496]]

###### 17
He who loves [[H157]] pleasure [[H8057]] will become poor; [[H4270]] the one who loves [[H157]] wine [[H3196]] and oil [[H8081]] will never [[H3808]] become rich. [[H6238]]

###### 18
The wicked [[H7563]] [shall become] a ransom [[H3724]] for the righteous, [[H6662]] and the faithless [[H898]] for [[H8478]] the upright. [[H3477]]

###### 19
Better [[H2896]] to live [[H3427]] in the desert [[H776]] than with a contentious [[H4066]] and ill-tempered [[H3708]] wife. [[H802]]

###### 20
Precious [[H2530]] treasures [[H214]] and oil [[H8081]] are in the dwelling [[H5116]] of the wise, [[H2450]] but a foolish [[H3684]] man [[H120]] consumes them. [[H1104]]

###### 21
He who pursues [[H7291]] righteousness [[H6666]] and loving devotion [[H2617]] finds [[H4672]] life, [[H2416]] righteousness, [[H6666]] and honor. [[H3519]]

###### 22
A wise [man] [[H2450]] scales [[H5927]] the city [[H5892]] of the mighty [[H1368]] and pulls down [[H3381]] the stronghold [[H5797]] in which they trust. [[H4009]]

###### 23
He who guards [[H8104]] his mouth [[H6310]] and tongue [[H3956]] keeps [[H8104]] his soul [[H5315]] from distress. [[H6869]]

###### 24
Proud, [[H2086]] Arrogant, [[H3093]] and Mocker [[H3887]] are the names [[H8034]] of him who acts [[H6213]] with excessive [[H5678]] pride. [[H2087]]

###### 25
The craving [[H8378]] of the sluggard [[H6102]] will kill him [[H4191]] because [[H3588]] his hands [[H3027]] refuse [[H3985]] to work. [[H6213]]

###### 26
All [[H3605]] day long [[H3117]] he covets [[H183]] more, [[H8378]] but the righteous [[H6662]] give [[H5414]] without [[H3808]] restraint. [[H2820]]

###### 27
The sacrifice [[H2077]] of the wicked [[H7563]] is detestable— [[H8441]] how much more so [[H637]] when [[H3588]] brought [[H935]] with ill intent! [[H2154]]

###### 28
A lying [[H3577]] witness [[H5707]] will perish, [[H6]] but the man [[H376]] who listens [to truth] [[H8085]] will speak [[H1696]] forever. [[H5331]]

###### 29
A wicked [[H7563]] man [[H376]] hardens [[H5810]] his face, [[H6440]] but the upright [man] [[H3477]] makes [[H3559]] his way {sure}. [[H1870]]

###### 30
No [[H369]] wisdom, [[H2451]] no [[H369]] understanding, [[H8394]] and no [[H369]] counsel [[H6098]] can prevail against [[H5048]] the LORD. [[H3069]]

###### 31
A horse [[H5483]] is prepared [[H3559]] for the day [[H3117]] of battle, [[H4421]] but victory [[H8668]] [is] of the LORD. [[H3068]]
