### 1
My son, [[H1121]] if [[H518]] you have put up security [[H6148]] for your neighbor, [[H7453]] if you have struck hands in pledge [[H8628]] with a stranger, [[H2114]]

### 2
if you have been trapped [[H3369]] by the words [[H561]] of your lips, [[H6310]] ensnared [[H3920]] by the words [[H561]] of your mouth, [[H6310]]

### 3
then [[H645]] do [[H6213]] this, [[H2063]] my son, [[H1121]] to free yourself, [[H5337]] for [[H3588]] you have fallen [[H935]] into your neighbor’s [[H7453]] hands: [[H3709]] Go, [[H1980]] humble yourself, [[H7511]] and press your plea [[H7292]] with your neighbor. [[H7453]]

### 4
Allow [[H5414]] no [[H408]] sleep [[H8142]] to your eyes [[H5869]] or slumber [[H8572]] to your eyelids. [[H6079]]

### 5
Free yourself, [[H5337]] like a gazelle [[H6643]] from the hand [of the hunter], [[H3027]] like a bird [[H6833]] from [[H3027]] the fowler’s snare. [[H3353]]

### 6
Walk in the manner of [[H1980]] the ant, [[H5244]] O sluggard; [[H6102]] observe [[H7200]] its ways [[H1870]] and be wise: [[H2449]]

### 7
Without [[H369]] a commander, [[H7101]] without an overseer [[H7860]] or ruler, [[H4910]]

### 8
it prepares [[H3559]] its provisions [[H3899]] in summer; [[H7019]] it gathers [[H103]] its food [[H3978]] at harvest. [[H7105]]

### 9
How [[H4970]] long [[H5704]] will you lie there, [[H7901]] O sluggard? [[H6102]] When [[H4970]] will you get up [[H6965]] from your sleep? [[H8142]]

### 10
A little [[H4592]] sleep, [[H8142]] a little [[H4592]] slumber, [[H8572]] a little [[H4592]] folding [[H2264]] of the hands [[H3027]] to rest, [[H7901]]

### 11
and poverty [[H7389]] will come upon you [[H935]] like a robber, [[H1980]] and need [[H4270]] like a bandit. [[H376]]

### 12
A worthless [[H1100]] person, [[H120]] a wicked [[H205]] man, [[H376]] walks [[H1980]] with a perverse [[H6143]] mouth, [[H6310]]

### 13
winking [[H7169]] his eyes, [[H5869]] speaking [[H4448]] with his feet, [[H7272]] and pointing [[H3384]] with his fingers. [[H676]]

### 14
With deceit [[H8419]] in his heart [[H3820]] he devises [[H2790]] evil; [[H7451]] he continually [[H3605]] sows [[H7971]] discord. [[H4066]]

### 15
Therefore [[H5921]] calamity [[H343]] will come upon him [[H935]] suddenly; [[H6597]] in an instant [[H6621]] he will be shattered [[H7665]] beyond [[H369]] recovery. [[H4832]]

### 16
There are [[H2007]] six [things that] [[H8337]] the LORD [[H3068]] hates, [[H8130]] seven [[H7651]] that are detestable [[H8441]] to Him: [[H5315]]

### 17
haughty [[H7311]] eyes, [[H5869]] a lying [[H8267]] tongue, [[H3956]] hands [[H3027]] that shed [[H8210]] innocent [[H5355]] blood, [[H1818]]

### 18
a heart [[H3820]] that devises [[H2790]] wicked [[H205]] schemes, [[H4284]] feet [[H7272]] that run [[H7323]] swiftly [[H4116]] to evil, [[H7451]]

### 19
a false [[H8267]] witness [[H5707]] who gives false [[H3577]] testimony, [[H6315]] and one who stirs up [[H7971]] discord [[H4090]] among [[H996]] brothers. [[H251]]

### 20
My son, [[H1121]] keep [[H5341]] your father’s [[H1]] commandment, [[H4687]] and do not [[H408]] forsake [[H5203]] your mother’s [[H517]] teaching. [[H8451]]

### 21
Bind them [[H7194]] always [[H8548]] upon [[H5921]] your heart; [[H3820]] tie [[H6029]] them around [[H5921]] your neck. [[H1621]]

### 22
When you walk, [[H1980]] they will guide you; [[H5148]] when you [[H853]] lie down, [[H7901]] they will watch [[H8104]] over you; [[H5921]] when you awake, [[H6974]] they [[H1931]] will speak to you. [[H7878]]

### 23
For [[H3588]] this commandment [[H4687]] is a lamp, [[H5216]] this teaching [[H8451]] [is] a light, [[H216]] and the reproofs [[H8433]] of discipline [[H4148]] are the way [[H1870]] to life, [[H2416]]

### 24
to keep you [[H8104]] from the evil [[H7451]] woman, [[H802]] from the smooth [[H2513]] tongue [[H3956]] of the stranger. [[H5237]]

### 25
Do not [[H408]] lust [[H2530]] in your heart [[H3824]] for her beauty [[H3308]] or let her captivate you [[H3947]] with her eyes. [[H6079]]

### 26
For [[H3588]] the levy [[H1157]] of the prostitute [[H2181]] is poverty, [[H3603]] and the adulteress [[H802]] preys upon [[H6679]] your very [[H3368]] life. [[H5315]]

### 27
Can a man [[H376]] embrace [[H2846]] fire [[H784]] and his clothes [[H899]] not [[H3808]] be burned? [[H8313]]

### 28
Can [[H518]] a man [[H376]] walk [[H1980]] on [[H5921]] hot coals [[H1513]] without [[H3808]] scorching [[H3554]] his feet? [[H7272]]

### 29
So [[H3651]] is he who sleeps with [[H935]] another man’s [[H7453]] wife; [[H802]] no one [[H3808]] who touches her [[H5060]] will go unpunished. [[H5352]]

### 30
[Men] do not [[H3808]] despise [[H936]] the thief [[H1590]] if [[H3588]] he steals [[H1589]] to satisfy [[H4390]] his [[H5315]] hunger. [[H7456]]

### 31
Yet if caught, [[H4672]] he must pay [[H7999]] sevenfold; [[H7659]] he must give up [[H5414]] all [[H3605]] the wealth [[H1952]] of his house. [[H1004]]

### 32
[But] he who commits adultery [[H5003]] lacks [[H2638]] judgment; [[H3820]] whoever [[H1931]] does so [[H6213]] destroys [[H7843]] himself. [[H5315]]

### 33
Wounds [[H5061]] and dishonor [[H7036]] will befall him, [[H4672]] and his reproach [[H2781]] will never [[H3808]] be wiped away. [[H4229]]

### 34
For [[H3588]] jealousy [[H7068]] enrages a husband, [[H2534]] and he will show no [[H3808]] mercy [[H2550]] in the day [[H3117]] of vengeance. [[H5359]]

### 35
He will not [[H3808]] be appeased [[H5375]] by any [[H3605]] ransom, [[H3724]] [or] [[H3808]] persuaded [[H14]] by lavish [[H7235]] gifts. [[H7810]]
