[[Proverbs 24|←]] • [[Proverbs 26|→]]

---

### 1
These [are] [[H428]] additional [[H1571]] proverbs [[H4912]] of Solomon, [[H8010]] which [[H834]] were copied by [[H6275]] the men [[H376]] of Hezekiah [[H2396]] king [[H4428]] of Judah: [[H3063]]

### 2
It is the glory [[H3519]] of God [[H430]] to conceal [[H5641]] a matter [[H1697]] and the glory [[H3519]] of kings [[H4428]] to search it out. [[H2713]]

### 3
As the heavens [[H8064]] are high [[H7312]] and the earth [[H776]] is deep, [[H6011]] so the hearts [[H3820]] of kings [[H4428]] cannot [[H369]] be searched. [[H2714]]

### 4
Remove [[H1898]] the dross [[H5509]] from the silver, [[H3701]] and a vessel [[H3627]] for a silversmith [[H6884]] will come forth. [[H3318]]

### 5
Remove [[H1898]] the wicked [[H7563]] from the king’s [[H4428]] presence, [[H6440]] and his throne [[H3678]] will be established [[H3559]] in righteousness. [[H6664]]

### 6
Do not [[H408]] exalt yourself [[H1921]] in the presence [[H6440]] of the king, [[H4428]] and do not [[H408]] stand [[H5975]] in the place [[H4725]] of great [men]; [[H1419]]

### 7
for [[H3588]] it is better [[H2896]] that he says [[H559]] to you,  “Come up [[H5927]] here!” [[H2008]] than demote you [[H8213]] in the presence [[H6440]] of the prince. [[H5081]] Even what [[H834]] you have seen [[H7200]] with your own eyes, [[H5869]]

### 8
do not [[H408]] go out [[H3318]] to argue [[H7378]] in haste. [[H4118]] Otherwise, [[H6435]] what [[H4100]] will you do [[H6213]] in the end [[H319]] when your opponent [[H7453]] puts you to shame? [[H3637]]

### 9
Argue [[H7378]] your case [[H7379]] with [[H854]] your neighbor [[H7453]] without [[H408]] betraying [[H1540]] another’s [[H312]] confidence, [[H5475]]

### 10
lest [[H6435]] the one who hears [[H8085]] may disgrace you, [[H2616]] and your infamy [[H1681]] never [[H3808]] go away. [[H7725]]

### 11
A word [[H1697]] fitly [[H655]] spoken [[H1696]] [is like] apples [[H8598]] of gold [[H2091]] in settings [[H4906]] of silver. [[H3701]]

### 12
[Like] an earring [[H5141]] of gold [[H2091]] or an ornament [[H2481]] of fine gold [[H3800]] is a wise man’s [[H2450]] rebuke [[H3198]] to [[H5921]] a listening [[H8085]] ear. [[H241]]

### 13
Like the cold [[H6793]] of snow [[H7950]] in the time [[H3117]] of harvest [[H7105]] [is] a trustworthy [[H539]] messenger [[H6735]] to those who send him; [[H7971]] he refreshes [[H7725]] the soul [[H5315]] of his masters. [[H113]]

### 14
[Like] clouds [[H5387]] and wind [[H7307]] without [[H369]] rain [[H1653]] [is] the man [[H376]] who boasts [[H1984]] of gifts [[H4991]] never given. [[H8267]]

### 15
Through patience [[H753]] a ruler [[H7101]] can be persuaded, [[H6601]] and a gentle [[H7390]] tongue [[H3956]] can break [[H7665]] a bone. [[H1634]]

### 16
If you find [[H4672]] honey, [[H1706]] eat [[H398]] just what you need, [[H1767]] lest [[H6435]] you have too much [[H7646]] and vomit it up. [[H6958]]

### 17
Seldom [[H3365]] set foot [[H7272]] in your neighbor’s [[H7453]] house, [[H1004]] lest [[H6435]] he grow weary [[H7646]] and hate you. [[H8130]]

### 18
[Like] a club [[H4650]] or sword [[H2719]] or sharp [[H8150]] arrow [[H2671]] [is] a man [[H376]] who bears [[H6030]] FALSE [[H8267]] witness [[H5707]] against his neighbor. [[H7453]]

### 19
[Like] a broken [[H7465]] tooth [[H8127]] or a foot [[H7272]] out of joint [[H4154]] is confidence [[H4009]] in a faithless man [[H898]] in time [[H3117]] of trouble. [[H6869]]

### 20
[Like] one who removes [[H5710]] a garment [[H899]] on a cold [[H7135]] day [[H3117]] or vinegar [[H2558]] poured on [[H5921]] soda [[H5427]] [is] one who sings [[H7891]] songs [[H7892]] to [[H5921]] a heavy [[H7451]] heart. [[H3820]]

### 21
If [[H518]] your enemy [[H8130]] is hungry, [[H7456]] give him food [[H3899]] to eat, [[H398]] and if [[H518]] he is thirsty, [[H6771]] give him water [[H4325]] to drink. [[H8248]]

### 22
For [in so doing], [[H3588]] you [[H859]] will heap [[H2846]] burning coals [[H1513]] on [[H5921]] his head, [[H7218]] and the LORD [[H3069]] will reward you. [[H7999]]

### 23
As the north [[H6828]] wind [[H7307]] brings forth [[H2342]] rain, [[H1653]] so a backbiting [[H5643]] tongue [[H3956]] [brings] angry [[H2194]] looks. [[H6440]]

### 24
Better [[H2896]] to live [[H3427]] on [[H5921]] a corner [[H6438]] of the roof [[H1406]] than to share [[H2267]] a house [[H1004]] with a quarrelsome [[H4066]] wife. [[H802]]

### 25
[Like] cold [[H7119]] water [[H4325]] to [[H5921]] a weary [[H5889]] soul [[H5315]] [is] good [[H2896]] news [[H8052]] from a distant [[H4801]] land. [[H776]]

### 26
Like a muddied [[H7515]] spring [[H4599]] or a polluted [[H7843]] well [[H4726]] is a righteous man [[H6662]] who gives way [[H4131]] to [[H6440]] the wicked. [[H7563]]

### 27
It is not [[H3808]] good [[H2896]] to eat [[H398]] too much [[H7235]] honey [[H1706]] or to search out [[H2714]] one’s own glory. [[H3519]]

### 28
Like a city [[H5892]] whose walls [[H2346]] are broken down [[H6555]] is a man [[H376]] who [[H834]] does not [[H369]] control [[H4623]] his temper. [[H7307]]
