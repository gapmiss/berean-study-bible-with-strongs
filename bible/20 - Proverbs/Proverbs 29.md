# Proverbs 29

[[Proverbs 28|←]] • [[Proverbs 30|→]]

---

### 1
A man who [[H376]] remains stiff-necked [[H7185]] after much reproof [[H8433]] will suddenly [[H6621]] be shattered [[H7665]] beyond recovery. [[H4832]]

### 2
When the righteous [[H6662]] flourish, [[H7235]] the people [[H5971]] rejoice, [[H8055]] but when the wicked [[H7563]] rule, [[H4910]] the people [[H5971]] groan. [[H584]]

### 3
A man [[H376]] who loves [[H157]] wisdom [[H2451]] brings joy [[H8055]] to his father, [[H1]] but a companion [[H7462]] of prostitutes [[H2181]] squanders [[H6]] his wealth. [[H1952]]

### 4
By justice [[H4941]] a king [[H4428]] gives stability [[H5975]] to the land, [[H776]] but a man [[H376]] who exacts tribute [[H8641]] demolishes it. [[H2040]]

### 5
A man [[H1397]] who flatters [[H2505]] his neighbor [[H7453]] spreads [[H6566]] a net [[H7568]] for [[H5921]] his feet. [[H6471]]

### 6
An evil [[H7451]] man [[H376]] is caught [[H4170]] by his own sin, [[H6588]] but a righteous one [[H6662]] sings [[H7442]] and rejoices. [[H8055]]

### 7
The righteous [[H6662]] consider [[H3045]] the cause [[H1779]] of the poor, [[H1800]] but the wicked [[H7563]] have no [[H3808]] regard [[H995]] for such concerns. [[H1847]]

### 8
Mockers [[H376]] inflame [[H6315]] a city, [[H7151]] but the wise [[H2450]] turn away [[H7725]] anger. [[H639]]

### 9
If a wise [[H2450]] man [[H376]] goes to court [[H8199]] with [[H854]] a fool, [[H191]] there will be raving [[H7264]] and laughing [[H7832]] with no [[H369]] resolution. [[H5183]]

### 10
Men [[H582]] of bloodshed [[H1818]] hate [[H8130]] a blameless man, [[H8535]] but the upright [[H3477]] care for [[H1245]] his life. [[H5315]]

### 11
A fool [[H3684]] vents [[H3318]] all [[H3605]] his anger, [[H7307]] but a wise man [[H2450]] holds [[H7623]] it back. [[H268]]

### 12
If a ruler [[H4910]] listens [[H7181]] to [[H5921]] lies, [[H1697]] all [[H3605]] his officials [[H8334]] will be wicked. [[H7563]]

### 13
The poor man [[H7326]] and the oppressor [[H376]] have this in common: [[H6298]] The LORD [[H3068]] gives light [[H215]] to the eyes [[H5869]] of both. [[H8147]]

### 14
A king [[H4428]] who judges [[H8199]] the poor [[H1800]] with fairness— [[H571]] his throne [[H3678]] will be established forever. [[H3559]]

### 15
A rod [[H7626]] of correction [[H8433]] imparts [[H5414]] wisdom, [[H2451]] but a child [[H5288]] left to himself [[H7971]] disgraces [[H954]] his mother. [[H517]]

### 16
When the wicked [[H7563]] thrive, [[H7235]] rebellion [[H6588]] increases; [[H7235]] but the righteous [[H6662]] will see [[H7200]] their downfall. [[H4658]]

### 17
Discipline [[H3256]] your son, [[H1121]] and he will give you rest; [[H5117]] he will bring [[H5414]] delight [[H4574]] to your soul. [[H5315]]

### 18
Where [there is] no [[H369]] vision, [[H2377]] the people [[H5971]] cast off restraint; [[H6544]] but blessed [is] [[H835]] he who keeps [[H8104]] the law. [[H8451]]

### 19
A servant [[H5650]] cannot [[H3808]] be corrected [[H3256]] by words [alone]; [[H1697]] though [[H3588]] he understands, [[H995]] he will not [[H369]] respond. [[H4617]]

### 20
Do you see [[H2372]] a man [[H376]] who speaks [[H1697]] in haste? [[H213]] There is more hope [[H8615]] for a fool [[H3684]] than for him. [[H4480]]

### 21
A servant [[H5650]] pampered [[H6445]] from his youth [[H5290]] will bring [[H1961]] grief [[H4497]] in the end. [[H319]]

### 22
An angry [[H639]] man [[H376]] stirs up [[H1624]] dissension, [[H4066]] and a hot-tempered [[H2534]] man [[H1167]] abounds [[H7227]] in transgression. [[H6588]]

### 23
A man’s [[H120]] pride [[H1346]] will bring him low, [[H8213]] but a humble [[H8217]] spirit [[H7307]] will obtain [[H8551]] honor. [[H3519]]

### 24
A partner [[H2505]] to [[H5973]] a thief [[H1590]] hates [[H8130]] his own soul; [[H5315]] he receives [[H8085]] the oath, [[H423]] but will not [[H3808]] testify. [[H5046]]

### 25
The fear [[H2731]] of man [[H120]] is [[H5414]] a snare, [[H4170]] but whoever trusts [[H982]] in the LORD [[H3068]] will be set securely on high. [[H7682]]

### 26
Many [[H7227]] seek [[H1245]] the ruler’s [[H4910]] favor, [[H6440]] but a man [[H376]] receives justice [[H4941]] from the LORD. [[H3068]]

### 27
An unjust [[H5766]] man [[H376]] is detestable [[H8441]] to the righteous, [[H6662]] and one whose way [[H1870]] is upright [[H3477]] is detestable [[H8441]] to the wicked. [[H7563]]
