[And] He has made known [[G1107]] to us [[G1473]] the [[G3588]] mystery [[G3466]] of His [[G846]] will [[G2307]] according to [[G2596]] His [[G846]] good pleasure, [[G2107]] which [[G3739]] He purposed [[G4388]] in [[G1722]] [Christ] [[G846]]

as [[G1519]] a plan [[G3622]] for the [[G3588]] fullness [[G4138]] of [[G3588]] time, [[G2540]] to bring [[G346]] all things [[G3956]] in [[G1909]] heaven [[G3772]] and [[G2532]] on [[G1909]] earth [[G1093]] {together} in [[G1722]] Christ. [[G5547]]

### 11
In [[G1722]] Him [[G846]] we were also chosen as God’s own, [[G2820]] having been predestined [[G4309]] according to [[G2596]] [the] plan [[G4286]] of [Him who] [[G3588]] works out [[G1754]] everything [[G3956]] by [[G2596]] the [[G3588]] counsel [[G1012]] of [[G3588]] His [[G846]] will, [[G2307]]

### 12
in order that [[G1519]] we, [[G1473]] who [[G3588]] were the first to hope [[G4276]] in [[G1722]] Christ, [[G5547]] would be [[G1510]] for [[G1519]] [the] praise [[G1868]] of His [[G846]] glory. [[G1391]]

### 13
And [[G2532]] in [[G1722]] [Him], [[G3739]] having heard [[G191]] and [[G2532]] believed [[G4100]] the [[G3588]] word [[G3056]] of truth— [[G225]] the [[G3588]] gospel [[G2098]] of [[G3588]] your [[G4771]] salvation— [[G4991]] you [[G4771]] were sealed [[G4972]] with [[G3588]] the [[G3588]] promised [[G1860]] Holy [[G40]] Spirit, [[G4151]]

For this reason, [[G1223]] ever since [[G2504]] I heard about [[G191]] your [[G4771]] faith [[G4102]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] Jesus [[G2424]] and [[G2532]] [your] [[G3588]] love [[G26]] for [[G1519]] all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] saints, [[G40]]

### 16
{I have} not [[G3756]] stopped [[G3973]] giving thanks [[G2168]] for [[G5228]] you, [[G4771]] remembering you [[G3417]] in [[G1909]] my [[G1473]] prayers [[G4335]]

[ and asking ] that [[G2443]] the [[G3588]] God [[G2316]] of our [[G1473]] Lord [[G2962]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ, [[G5547]] the [[G3588]] glorious [[G1391]] Father, [[G3962]] may give [[G1325]] you [[G4771]] [a] spirit [[G4151]] of wisdom [[G4678]] and [[G2532]] revelation [[G602]] in [[G1722]] [your] knowledge [[G1922]] of Him. [[G846]]

### 18
[ I ask that ] the [[G3588]] eyes [[G3788]] of [[G3588]] your [[G4771]] heart [[G2588]] may be enlightened, [[G5461]] so that [[G1519]] you [[G4771]] may know [[G1492]] the [[G3588]] hope [[G1680]] of [[G3588]] His [[G846]] calling, [[G2821]] the [[G3588]] riches [[G4149]] of [[G3588]] His [[G846]] glorious [[G1391]] inheritance [[G2817]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] saints, [[G40]]

### 19
and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] surpassing [[G5235]] greatness [[G3174]] of [[G3588]] His [[G846]] power [[G1411]] to [[G1519]] us [[G1473]] who [[G3588]] believe. [[G4100]] He displayed [ this power] [[G2596]] in the [[G3588]] working [[G1753]] of [[G3588]] His [[G846]] mighty [[G2479]] strength, [[G2904]]

### 20

### 21
far above [[G5231]] all [[G3956]] rule [[G746]] and [[G2532]] authority, [[G1849]] power [[G1411]] and [[G2532]] dominion, [[G2963]] and [[G2532]] every [[G3956]] name [[G3686]] that is named, [[G3687]] not [[G3756]] only [[G3440]] in [[G1722]] this [[G3778]] age, [[G165]] but [[G235]] also [[G2532]] in [[G1722]] the [one] [[G3588]] to come. [[G3195]]

### 22
And [[G2532]] [God] put [[G5293]] everything [[G3956]] under [[G5259]] His [[G846]] feet [[G4228]] and [[G2532]] made [[G1325]] Him [[G846]] head [[G2776]] over [[G5228]] everything [[G3956]] for the [[G3588]] church, [[G1577]]

### 23
