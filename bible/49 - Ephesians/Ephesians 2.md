# Ephesians 2

[[Ephesians 1|←]] • [[Ephesians 3|→]]

---

### 1
As for [[G2532]] you, [[G4771]] you were [[G1510]] dead [[G3498]] in [[G3588]] your [[G4771]] trespasses [[G3900]] and [[G2532]] sins, [[G266]]

### 2
in [[G1722]] which [[G3739]] you used to walk [[G4043]] when you conformed to [[G2596]] the [[G3588]] ways [[G165]] of this [[G3778]] world [[G2889]] [and] [[G2596]] of the [[G3588]] ruler [[G758]] of the [[G3588]] power [[G1849]] of the [[G3588]] air, [[G109]] the [[G3588]] spirit [who is] [[G4151]] now [[G3568]] at work [[G1754]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] sons [[G5207]] of disobedience. [[G543]]

### 3
We [[G1473]] all [[G3956]] lived [[G390]] among [[G1722]] [them] [[G3739]] at one time [[G4218]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] cravings [[G1939]] of our [[G1473]] flesh, [[G4561]] indulging [[G4160]] [its] [[G3588]] desires [[G2307]] and [[G2532]] thoughts. [[G1271]] Like [[G5613]] the [[G3588]] rest, [[G3062]] we were [[G1510]] by nature [[G5449]] children [[G5043]] of wrath. [[G3709]]

### 4
But [[G1161]] because of [[G1223]] His [[G846]] great [[G4183]] love [[G26]] for us, [[G3739]] God, [[G2316]] who is [[G1510]] rich [[G4145]] in [[G1722]] mercy, [[G1656]]

### 5
made [us] alive with [[G4806]] Christ, [[G5547]] even when [[G2532]] we [[G1473]] were [[G1510]] dead [[G3498]] in our [[G3588]] trespasses. [[G3900]] [It is] by grace [[G5485]] you have been [[G1510]] saved! [[G4982]]

### 6
And [[G2532]] [God] raised [us] up with [Christ] [[G4891]] and [[G2532]] seated [us with Him] [[G4776]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] heavenly realms [[G2032]] in [[G1722]] Christ [[G5547]] Jesus, [[G2424]]

### 7
in order that [[G2443]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] coming [[G1904]] ages [[G165]] He might display [[G1731]] the [[G3588]] surpassing [[G5235]] riches [[G4149]] of [[G3588]] His [[G846]] grace, [[G5485]] [demonstrated] by [[G1722]] [His] kindness [[G5544]] to [[G1909]] us [[G1473]] in [[G1722]] Christ [[G5547]] Jesus. [[G2424]]

### 8
For [it is] [[G1063]] by grace [[G5485]] you have been [[G1510]] saved [[G4982]] through [[G1223]] faith, [[G4102]] and [[G2532]] this [[G3778]] not [[G3756]] from [[G1537]] yourselves; [[G4771]] [it is] the [[G3588]] gift [[G1435]] of God, [[G2316]]

### 9
not [[G3756]] by [[G1537]] works, [[G2041]] so that [[G2443]] no [[G3361]] one [[G5100]] can boast. [[G2744]]

### 10
For [[G1063]] we are [[G1510]] [God’s] [[G846]] workmanship, [[G4161]] created [[G2936]] in [[G1722]] Christ [[G5547]] Jesus [[G2424]] to do [[G1909]] good [[G18]] works, [[G2041]] which [[G3739]] God [[G2316]] prepared in advance [[G4282]] as [[G2443]] our way of life. [[G4043]]

### 11
Therefore [[G1352]] remember [[G3421]] that [[G3754]] formerly [[G4218]] you [[G4771]] who [are] [[G3588]] Gentiles [[G1484]] in [[G1722]] [the] flesh [[G4561]] [and] called [[G3004]] uncircumcised [[G203]] by [[G5259]] the [[G3588]] so-called [[G3004]] circumcision [[G4061]] ({that done} in [[G1722]] [the] body [[G4561]] by human hands)— [[G5499]]

### 12
[remember] that [[G3754]] at [[G3588]] that [[G1565]] time [[G2540]] you were [[G1510]] separate from [[G5565]] Christ, [[G5547]] alienated from [[G526]] the [[G3588]] commonwealth [[G4174]] of Israel, [[G2474]] and [[G2532]] strangers [[G3581]] to the [[G3588]] covenants [[G1242]] of the [[G3588]] promise, [[G1860]] without [[G3361]] hope [[G1680]] and [[G2532]] without God [[G112]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] world. [[G2889]]

### 13
But [[G1161]] now [[G3570]] in [[G1722]] Christ [[G5547]] Jesus [[G2424]] you [[G4771]] who [[G3588]] once [[G4218]] were [[G1510]] far away [[G3112]] have been brought [[G1096]] near [[G1451]] through [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] blood [[G129]] of Christ. [[G5547]]

### 14
For [[G1063]] He Himself [[G846]] is [[G1510]] our [[G1473]] peace, [[G1515]] who [[G3588]] has made [[G4160]] the two [[G297]] one [[G1520]] and [[G2532]] has torn down [[G3089]] the [[G3588]] dividing [[G3320]] wall [[G5418]] of hostility [[G2189]]

### 15
by abolishing [[G2673]] in [[G1722]] His [[G846]] flesh [[G4561]] the [[G3588]] law [[G3551]] of commandments [[G1785]] [and] [[G1722]] decrees. [[G1378]] [ He did this ] to [[G2443]] create [[G2936]] in [[G1722]] Himself [[G848]] one [[G1520]] new [[G2537]] man [[G444]] [out of] [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] two, [[G1417]] [thus] making [[G4160]] peace [[G1515]]

### 16
and [[G2532]] reconciling [[G604]] both [of them] [[G297]] to God [[G2316]] in [[G1722]] one [[G1520]] body [[G4983]] through [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] cross, [[G4716]] by [[G1722]] which [[G846]] He extinguished [[G615]] [their] [[G3588]] hostility. [[G2189]]

### 17
He came [[G2064]] [and] preached [[G2097]] peace [[G1515]] to you [[G4771]] who [were] [[G3588]] far away [[G3112]] and [[G2532]] peace [[G1515]] to those [[G3588]] [who were] near. [[G1451]]

### 18
For [[G3754]] through [[G1223]] Him [[G846]] we both have [[G2192]] access [[G4318]] to [[G4314]] the [[G3588]] Father [[G3962]] by [[G1722]] one [[G1520]] Spirit. [[G4151]]

### 19
Therefore [[G686]] you are [[G1510]] no longer [[G3765]] strangers [[G3581]] and [[G2532]] foreigners, [[G3941]] but [[G235]] fellow citizens [[G4847]] of the [[G3588]] saints [[G40]] and [[G2532]] members of God’s household, [[G3609]]

### 20
built [[G2026]] on [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] foundation [[G2310]] of the [[G3588]] apostles [[G652]] and [[G2532]] prophets, [[G4396]] [with] Christ [[G5547]] Jesus [[G2424]] Himself [[G846]] as [[G1510]] [the] cornerstone. [[G204]]

### 21
In [[G1722]] Him [[G3739]] the whole [[G3956]] building [[G3619]] is fitted together [[G4883]] [and] grows [[G837]] into [[G1519]] a holy [[G40]] temple [[G3485]] in [[G1722]] [the] Lord. [[G2962]]

### 22
[And] in [[G1722]] [Him] [[G3739]] you [[G4771]] too {are} [[G2532]] being built together [[G4925]] into [[G1519]] a dwelling place [[G2732]] for God [[G2316]] in [[G1722]] [His] Spirit. [[G4151]]
