### 1
How [[H4100]] beautiful [[H3303]] are your sandaled [[H5275]] feet, [[H6471]] O daughter [[H1323]] of the prince! [[H5081]] The curves [[H2542]] of your thighs [[H3409]] are like [[H3644]] jewels, [[H2481]] the handiwork [[H4639]] of a master. [[H542]]

### 2
Your navel [[H8326]] is a rounded [[H5469]] goblet; [[H101]] it never [[H408]] lacks [[H2637]] blended wine. [[H4197]] Your waist [[H990]] is a mound [[H6194]] of wheat [[H2406]] encircled [[H5473]] by the lilies. [[H7799]]

### 3
Your breasts [[H7699]] are like two [[H8147]] fawns, [[H6082]] twins [[H8380]] of a gazelle. [[H6646]]

### 4
Your neck [[H6677]] is like a tower [[H4026]] [made] of ivory; [[H8127]] your eyes [[H5869]] are like the pools [[H1295]] of Heshbon [[H2809]] by [[H5921]] the gate [[H8179]] of Bath-rabbim; [[H1337]] your nose [[H639]] is like the tower [[H4026]] of Lebanon [[H3844]] facing toward [[H6822]] Damascus. [[H1834]]

### 5
Your head [[H7218]] crowns you [[H5921]] like Mount Carmel, [[H3760]] the hair [[H1803]] of your head [[H7218]] like purple [threads]; [[H713]] the king [[H4428]] is captured [[H631]] in your tresses. [[H7298]]

### 6
How [[H4100]] fair [[H3302]] and how [[H4100]] pleasant [you are], [[H5276]] O love, [[H160]] with your delights! [[H8588]]

### 7
Your stature [[H6967]] is like [[H1819]] a palm tree; [[H8558]] your breasts [[H7699]] are clusters of fruit. [[H811]]

### 8
I said, [[H559]] “I will climb [[H5927]] the palm tree; [[H8558]] I will take hold [[H270]] of its fruit.” [[H5577]] May your breasts [[H7699]] be [[H1961]] like clusters [[H811]] of the vine, [[H1612]] the fragrance [[H7381]] of your breath [[H639]] like apples, [[H8598]]

### 9
and your mouth [[H2441]] like the finest [[H2896]] wine. [[H3196]] May it flow [[H1980]] smoothly [[H4339]] to my beloved, [[H1730]] gliding gently over [[H1680]] lips [[H8193]] and teeth. [[H3462]]

### 10
I [[H589]] belong to my beloved, [[H1730]] and his desire [[H8669]] is for me. [[H5921]]

### 11
Come, [[H1980]] my beloved, [[H1730]] let us go [[H3318]] to the countryside; [[H7704]] let us spend the night [[H3885]] in the villages. [[H3723]]

### 12
Let us go early [[H7925]] to the vineyards [[H3754]] to see [[H7200]] if [[H518]] the vine [[H1612]] has budded, [[H6524]] if the blossom [[H5563]] has opened, [[H6605]] if the pomegranates are in bloom— [[H7416]] there [[H8033]] I will give [[H5414]] you my love. [[H1730]]

### 13
The mandrakes [[H1736]] send forth [[H5414]] a fragrance, [[H7381]] and at [[H5921]] our door [[H6607]] is every [[H3605]] delicacy, [[H4022]] new [[H2319]] as [[H1571]] well as old, [[H3465]] that I have treasured up [[H6845]] for you,  my beloved. [[H1730]]
