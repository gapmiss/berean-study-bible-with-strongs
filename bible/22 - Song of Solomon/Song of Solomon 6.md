###### 1
Where [[H575]] has your beloved [[H1730]] gone, [[H1980]] O most beautiful [[H3303]] among women? [[H802]] Which way [[H575]] has he [[H1730]] turned? [[H6437]] We will seek [[H1245]] him with you. [[H5973]]

###### 2
My beloved [[H1730]] has gone down [[H3381]] to his garden, [[H1588]] to the beds [[H6170]] of spices, [[H1314]] to pasture [his flock] [[H7462]] in the gardens, [[H1588]] and to gather [[H3950]] lilies. [[H7799]]

###### 3
I [[H589]] belong to my beloved [[H1730]] and [he] [[H1730]] belongs to me;  he pastures [his flock] [[H7462]] among the lilies. [[H7799]]

###### 4
You [[H859]] are beautiful, [[H3303]] my darling, [[H7474]] as Tirzah, [[H8656]] lovely [[H5000]] as Jerusalem, [[H3389]] majestic [[H366]] as an army with banners. [[H1713]]

###### 5
Turn your eyes [[H5869]] away [[H5437]] from [[H4480]] me, [[H5048]] for they [[H1992]] have overcome me. [[H7292]] Your hair [[H8181]] is like a flock [[H5739]] of goats [[H5795]] streaming down [[H1570]] from Gilead. [[H1568]]

###### 6
Your teeth [[H8127]] are like a flock [[H5739]] of sheep [[H7353]] coming up [[H5927]] from [[H4480]] the washing; [[H7367]] each [[H3605]] has its twin, [[H8382]] and not one [[H369]] [is] lost. [[H7909]]

###### 7
Your brow [[H7541]] behind [[H1157]] your veil [[H6777]] is like a slice [[H6400]] of pomegranate. [[H7416]]

###### 8
There [[H1992]] are sixty [[H8346]] queens [[H4436]] and eighty [[H8084]] concubines, [[H6370]] and maidens [[H5959]] without [[H369]] number, [[H4557]]

###### 9
but my dove, [[H3123]] my perfect [[H8535]] one, [[H259]] is unique, [[H259]] the favorite [[H1249]] of the mother [[H517]] who bore her. [[H3205]] The maidens [[H1323]] see her [[H7200]] and call her blessed; [[H833]] the queens [[H4436]] and concubines [[H6370]] sing her praises. [[H1984]]

###### 10
Who [[H4310]] is this [[H2063]] who shines [[H8259]] like [[H3644]] the dawn, [[H7837]] as fair [[H3303]] as the moon, [[H3842]] as bright [[H1249]] as the sun, [[H2535]] as majestic [[H366]] as the stars in procession? [[H1713]]

###### 11
I went down [[H3381]] to [[H413]] the walnut [[H93]] grove [[H1594]] to see [[H7200]] the blossoms [[H3]] of the valley, [[H5158]] to see [[H7200]] if the vines [[H1612]] were budding, [[H6524]] or the pomegranates [[H7416]] in bloom. [[H5132]]

###### 12
Before [[H3808]] I realized it, [[H3045]] my desire [[H5315]] had set me [[H7760]] among the chariots [[H4818]] of my noble [[H5081]] people. [[H5971]]

###### 13
Come back, [[H7725]] come back, [[H7725]] O Shulammite! [[H7759]] Come back, [[H7725]] come back, [[H7725]] that we may gaze upon you. [[H2372]] Why [[H4100]] do you look [[H2372]] at the Shulammite, [[H7759]] as on the dance [[H4246]] of Mahanaim? [[H4264]]
