### 1
I have come [[H935]] to my garden, [[H1588]] my sister, [[H269]] my bride; [[H3618]] I have gathered [[H717]] my myrrh [[H4753]] with [[H5973]] my spice. [[H1314]] I have eaten [[H398]] my honeycomb [[H3293]] with [[H5973]] my honey; [[H1706]] I have drunk [[H8354]] my wine [[H3196]] with [[H5973]] my milk. [[H2461]] Eat, [[H398]] O friends, [[H7453]] [and] drink; [[H8354]] drink freely, [[H7937]] O beloved. [[H1730]]

### 2
I [[H589]] sleep, [[H3462]] but my heart [[H3820]] is awake. [[H5782]] A sound! [[H6963]] My beloved [[H1730]] is knocking: [[H1849]] “Open to me, [[H6605]] my sister, [[H269]] my darling, [[H7474]] my dove, [[H3123]] my perfect one.” [[H8535]] My head [[H7218]] is drenched [[H4390]] with dew, [[H2919]] my hair [[H6977]] with the dampness [[H7447]] of the night. [[H3915]]

### 3
I have taken off [[H6584]] my robe— [[H3801]] must I [[H349]] put it back on? [[H3847]] I have washed [[H7364]] my feet— [[H7272]] must I [[H349]] soil them again? [[H2936]]

### 4
My beloved [[H1730]] put [[H7971]] his hand [[H3027]] to [[H4480]] the latch; [[H2356]] my heart [[H4578]] pounded [[H1993]] for him. [[H5921]]

### 5
I [[H589]] rose up [[H6965]] to open [[H6605]] for my beloved. [[H1730]] My hands [[H3027]] dripped [[H5197]] with myrrh, [[H4753]] my fingers [[H676]] with flowing [[H5674]] myrrh [[H4753]] on [[H5921]] the handles [[H3709]] of the bolt. [[H4514]]

### 6
I [[H589]] opened [[H6605]] for my beloved, [[H1730]] but [he] [[H1730]] had turned [[H2559]] and gone. [[H5674]] My heart [[H5315]] sank [[H3318]] at his departure. [[H1696]] I sought him, [[H1245]] but did not [[H3808]] find him. [[H4672]] I called, [[H7121]] but he did not [[H3808]] answer. [[H6030]]

### 7
I encountered [[H4672]] the watchmen [[H8104]] on their rounds [[H5437]] of the city. [[H5892]] They beat me [[H5221]] and bruised me; [[H6481]] they took away [[H5375]] my cloak, [[H7289]] those guardians [[H8104]] of the walls. [[H2346]]

### 8
O daughters [[H1323]] of Jerusalem, [[H3389]] I adjure [[H7650]] you, [[H853]] if [[H518]] you find [[H4672]] my beloved, [[H1730]] tell him [[H5046]] I [[H589]] [am] sick [[H2470]] with love. [[H160]]

### 9
How [[H4100]] [is] your beloved [[H1730]] better than [others], [[H1730]] O most beautiful [[H3303]] among women? [[H802]] How [[H4100]] [is] your beloved [[H1730]] better than another, [[H1730]] that you [[H3602]] charge us so? [[H7650]]

### 10
My beloved [[H1730]] is dazzling [[H6703]] and ruddy, [[H122]] outstanding [[H1713]] among ten thousand. [[H7233]]

### 11
His head [[H7218]] is purest gold; [[H3800]] his hair [[H6977]] is wavy [[H8534]] and black [[H7838]] as a raven. [[H6158]]

### 12
His eyes [[H5869]] are like doves [[H3123]] beside [[H5921]] the streams [[H650]] of water, [[H4325]] bathed [[H7364]] in milk [[H2461]] [and] mounted [[H3427]] like [[H5921]] jewels. [[H4402]]

### 13
His cheeks [[H3895]] are like beds [[H6170]] of spice, [[H1314]] towers [[H4026]] of perfume. [[H4840]] His lips [[H8193]] are like lilies, [[H7799]] dripping [[H5197]] with flowing [[H5674]] myrrh. [[H4753]]

### 14
His arms [[H3027]] are rods [[H1550]] of gold [[H2091]] set [[H4390]] with chrysolite. [[H8658]] His body [[H4578]] is an ivory [[H8127]] panel [[H6247]] bedecked [[H5968]] with sapphires. [[H5601]]

### 15
His legs [[H7785]] [are] pillars [[H5982]] of marble [[H8336]] set [[H3245]] on [[H5921]] bases [[H134]] of pure gold. [[H6337]] His appearance [[H4758]] is like Lebanon, [[H3844]] as majestic [[H977]] as the cedars. [[H730]]

### 16
His mouth [[H2441]] [is] most sweet; [[H4477]] he is altogether [[H3605]] lovely. [[H4261]] This [[H2088]] [is] my beloved, [[H1730]] and this [[H2088]] is my friend, [[H7453]] O daughters [[H1323]] of Jerusalem. [[H3389]]
