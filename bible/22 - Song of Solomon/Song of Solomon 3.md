### 1
On [[H5921]] my bed [[H4904]] at night [[H3915]] I sought [[H1245]] the one [[H853]] I [[H5315]] love; [[H157]] I sought him [[H1245]] but did not [[H3808]] find him. [[H4672]]

### 2
I will arise [[H6965]] now [[H4994]] and go about [[H5437]] the city, [[H5892]] through the streets [[H7784]] and squares. [[H7339]] I will seek [[H1245]] the one [[H853]] I [[H5315]] love. [[H157]] So I sought him [[H1245]] but did not [[H3808]] find him. [[H4672]]

### 3
I encountered [[H4672]] the watchmen [[H8104]] on their rounds [[H5437]] of the city: [[H5892]] “Have you seen [the one] [[H7200]] I [[H5315]] love?” [[H157]]

### 4
I had just [[H4592]] passed [[H5674]] them [[H1992]] when [[H5704]] I found [[H4672]] the one [[H853]] I [[H5315]] love. [[H157]] I held him [[H270]] and would not [[H3808]] let go [[H7503]] until [[H5704]] I had brought [[H935]] him to [[H413]] my mother’s [[H517]] house, [[H1004]] to [[H413]] the chamber [[H2315]] of the one who conceived me. [[H2029]]

### 5
O daughters [[H1323]] of Jerusalem, [[H3389]] I charge [[H7650]] you [[H853]] by the gazelles [[H6643]] and [[H176]] does [[H355]] of the field: [[H7704]] Do not [[H518]] arouse [[H5782]] or [[H518]] awaken [[H5782]] love [[H160]] until [[H5704]] the time is right. [[H2654]]

### 6
Who [[H4310]] is this [[H2063]] coming up [[H5927]] from [[H4480]] the wilderness [[H4057]] like a column [[H8490]] of smoke, [[H6227]] scented [[H6999]] with myrrh [[H4753]] and frankincense [[H3828]] from all [[H3605]] the spices [[H81]] of the merchant? [[H7402]]

### 7
Behold, [[H2009]] it is Solomon’s [[H8010]] carriage, [[H4296]] escorted [[H5439]] by sixty [[H8346]] warriors [[H1368]] from the valiant [[H1368]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

### 8
All [[H3605]] are skilled [[H270]] with the sword, [[H2719]] experienced [[H3925]] in warfare. [[H4421]] Each [[H376]] has his sword [[H2719]] at [[H5921]] his side [[H3409]] prepared for the terror [[H6343]] of night. [[H3915]]

### 9
King [[H4428]] Solomon [[H8010]] has made [[H6213]] his carriage [[H668]] out of the timber [[H6086]] of Lebanon. [[H3844]]

### 10
He has made [[H6213]] its posts [[H5982]] of silver, [[H3701]] its base [[H7507]] of gold, [[H2091]] its seat [[H4817]] of purple [fabric]. [[H713]] Its interior [[H8432]] is inlaid [[H7528]] with love [[H160]] by the daughters [[H1323]] of Jerusalem. [[H3389]]

### 11
Come out, [[H3318]] O daughters [[H1323]] of Zion, [[H6726]] and gaze [[H7200]] at King [[H4428]] Solomon, [[H8010]] wearing the crown [[H5850]] his mother [[H517]] bestowed [[H5849]] on the day [[H3117]] of his wedding— [[H2861]] the day [[H3117]] of his heart’s [[H3820]] rejoicing. [[H8057]]
