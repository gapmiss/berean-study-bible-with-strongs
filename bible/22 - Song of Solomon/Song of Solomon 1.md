# Song of Solomon 1

[[Ecclesiastes 12|←]] • [[Song of Solomon 2|→]]

---

###### 1
Solomon’s [[H834]] Song [[H7892]] of Songs. [[H7892]]

###### 2
Let him kiss me [[H5401]] with the kisses [[H5390]] of his mouth! [[H6310]] For [[H3588]] your love [[H1730]] is more delightful [[H2896]] than wine. [[H3196]]

###### 3
The fragrance [[H7381]] of your perfume [[H8081]] is pleasing; [[H2896]] your name [[H8034]] is like perfume [[H8081]] poured out. [[H7324]] No wonder [[H5921]] the maidens [[H5959]] adore you. [[H157]]

###### 4
Take me [[H4900]] away with you— [[H310]] let us hurry! [[H7323]] May the king [[H4428]] bring me [[H935]] to his chambers. [[H2315]] We will rejoice [[H1523]] and delight [[H8055]] in you;  we will praise [[H2142]] your love [[H1730]] above wine. [[H3196]] It is only right [[H4339]] that they adore you. [[H157]]

###### 5
I [[H589]] am dark [[H7838]] yet lovely, [[H5000]] O daughters [[H1323]] of Jerusalem, [[H3389]] like the tents [[H168]] of Kedar, [[H6938]] like the curtains [[H3407]] of Solomon. [[H8010]]

###### 6
Do not [[H408]] stare [[H7200]] because I [[H589]] am dark, [[H7840]] for the sun [[H8121]] has looked upon me. [[H7805]] My mother’s [[H517]] sons [[H1121]] were angry [[H2787]] with me;  they made [[H7760]] me a keeper [[H5201]] of the vineyards, [[H3754]] [but] my own vineyard [[H3754]] I have neglected. [[H3808]]

###### 7
Tell me, [[H5046]] O one  I [[H5315]] love, [[H157]] where [[H349]] do you pasture your sheep? [[H7462]] Where [[H349]] do you rest them [[H7257]] at midday? [[H6672]] Why [[H4100]] should I be [[H1961]] like a veiled woman [[H5844]] beside [[H5921]] the flocks [[H5739]] of your companions? [[H2270]]

###### 8
If [[H518]] you do not [[H3808]] know, [[H3045]] O fairest [[H3303]] of women, [[H802]] follow [[H3318]] the tracks [[H6119]] of the flock, [[H6629]] and graze [[H7462]] your young goats [[H1429]] near [[H5921]] the tents [[H4908]] of the shepherds. [[H7462]]

###### 9
I compare you, [[H1819]] my darling, [[H7474]] to a mare [[H5484]] among Pharaoh’s [[H6547]] chariots. [[H7393]]

###### 10
Your cheeks [[H3895]] are beautiful [[H4998]] with ornaments, [[H8447]] your neck [[H6677]] with strings [of jewels]. [[H2737]]

###### 11
We will make you [[H6213]] ornaments [[H8447]] of gold, [[H2091]] [studded] with [[H5973]] beads [[H5351]] of silver. [[H3701]]

###### 12
While [[H5704]] the king [[H4428]] was at his table, [[H4524]] my perfume [[H5373]] spread [[H5414]] its fragrance. [[H7381]]

###### 13
My beloved [[H1730]] is to me  a sachet [[H6872]] of myrrh [[H4753]] resting [[H3885]] between [[H996]] my breasts. [[H7699]]

###### 14
My beloved [[H1730]] is to me  a cluster [[H811]] of henna blossoms [[H3724]] in the vineyards [[H3754]] of En-gedi. [[H5872]]

###### 15
How [[H2005]] beautiful [you are], [[H3303]] my darling! [[H7474]] Oh, how very [[H2005]] beautiful! [[H3303]] Your eyes [[H5869]] are [like] doves. [[H3123]]

###### 16
How [[H2005]] handsome [you are], [[H3303]] my beloved! [[H1730]] Oh, how [[H637]] delightful! [[H5273]] The soft grass [[H7488]] [is] our bed. [[H6210]]

###### 17
The beams [[H6982]] of our house [[H1004]] are cedars; [[H730]] our rafters [[H7351]] [are] fragrant firs. [[H1266]]
