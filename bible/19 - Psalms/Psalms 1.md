###### 1
Blessed [[H835]] [is] the man [[H376]] who [[H834]] does not [[H3808]] walk [[H1980]] in the counsel [[H6098]] of the wicked, [[H7563]] or [[H3808]] set foot [[H5975]] on the path [[H1870]] of sinners, [[H2400]] or [[H3808]] sit [[H3427]] in the seat [[H4186]] of mockers. [[H3887]]

###### 2
But [[H3588]] his delight [[H2656]] [is] in the law [[H8451]] of the LORD, [[H3069]] and on His law [[H8451]] he meditates [[H1897]] day [[H3119]] and night. [[H3915]]

###### 3
He is [[H1961]] like a tree [[H6086]] planted [[H8362]] by [[H5921]] streams [[H6388]] of water, [[H4325]] yielding [[H5414]] its fruit [[H6529]] in season, [[H6256]] whose leaf [[H5929]] does not [[H3808]] wither, [[H5034]] and [[H3605]] who prospers [[H6743]] in all he does. [[H6213]]

###### 4
Not [[H3808]] so [[H3651]] the wicked! [[H7563]] For [[H3588]] [they are] [[H518]] like chaff [[H4671]] driven off [[H5086]] by the wind. [[H7307]]

###### 5
Therefore [[H5921]] the wicked [[H7563]] {will} not [[H3808]] stand [[H6965]] in the judgment, [[H4941]] nor sinners [[H2400]] in the assembly [[H5712]] of the righteous. [[H6662]]

###### 6
For [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] guards [[H3045]] the path [[H1870]] of the righteous, [[H6662]] but the way [[H1870]] of the wicked [[H7563]] will perish. [[H6]]
