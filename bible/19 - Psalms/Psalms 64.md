### 1
For the choirmaster. [[H5329]] A Psalm [[H4210]] of David. [[H1732]] Hear, [[H8085]] O God, [[H430]] my voice [[H6963]] of complaint; [[H7879]] preserve [[H5341]] my life [[H2416]] from dread [[H6343]] of the enemy. [[H341]]

### 2
Hide me [[H5641]] from the scheming [[H5475]] of the wicked, [[H7489]] from the mob [[H7285]] of workers [[H6466]] of iniquity, [[H205]]

### 3
who [[H834]] sharpen [[H8150]] their tongues [[H3956]] like swords [[H2719]] and aim [[H1869]] their bitter [[H4751]] words [[H1697]] like arrows, [[H2671]]

### 4
ambushing [[H3384]] the innocent [[H8535]] in seclusion, [[H4565]] shooting [[H3384]] suddenly, [[H6597]] without [[H3808]] fear. [[H3372]]

### 5
They hold fast [[H2388]] to their evil [[H7451]] purpose; [[H1697]] they speak [[H5608]] of hiding [[H2934]] their snares. [[H4170]] “Who [[H4310]] will see [[H7200]] them?”  they say. [[H559]]

### 6
They devise [[H2664]] injustice [and say], [[H5766]] “We have perfected [[H8552]] a secret [[H2664]] plan.” [[H2665]] For the inner [[H7130]] man [[H376]] and the heart [[H3820]] are mysterious. [[H6013]]

### 7
But God [[H430]] will shoot [[H3384]] them with arrows; [[H2671]] suddenly [[H6597]] they will be [[H1961]] wounded. [[H4347]]

### 8
They will be made to stumble, [[H3782]] their own tongues [[H3956]] turned against them. [[H5921]] All [[H3605]] who see [[H7200]] will shake their heads. [[H5074]]

### 9
Then all [[H3605]] mankind [[H120]] will fear [[H3372]] and proclaim [[H5046]] the work [[H6467]] of God; [[H430]] so they will ponder [[H7919]] what He has done. [[H4639]]

### 10
Let the righteous [[H6662]] rejoice [[H8055]] in the LORD [[H3069]] and take refuge in Him; [[H2620]] let all [[H3605]] the upright [[H3477]] in heart [[H3820]] exult. [[H1984]]
