###### 1
Of David. [[H1732]] Do not [[H408]] fret over [[H2734]] doers of evil; [[H7489]] do not [[H408]] envy [[H7065]] those who do [[H6213]] wrong. [[H5766]]

###### 2
For [[H3588]] they wither [[H5243]] quickly [[H4120]] like grass [[H2682]] and wilt [[H5034]] like tender [[H3418]] plants. [[H1877]]

###### 3
Trust [[H982]] in the LORD [[H3068]] and do [[H6213]] good; [[H2896]] dwell [[H7931]] in the land [[H776]] and cultivate [[H7462]] faithfulness. [[H530]]

###### 4
Delight yourself [[H6026]] in [[H5921]] the LORD, [[H3068]] and He will give [[H5414]] you  the desires [[H4862]] of your heart. [[H3820]]

###### 5
Commit [[H1556]] your way [[H1870]] to [[H5921]] the LORD; [[H3068]] trust [[H982]] in Him, [[H5921]] and He [[H1931]] will do it. [[H6213]]

###### 6
He will bring forth [[H3318]] your righteousness [[H6664]] like the dawn, [[H216]] your justice [[H4941]] like the noonday sun. [[H6672]]

###### 7
Be still [[H1826]] before the LORD [[H3068]] and wait patiently [[H2342]] for Him;  fret [[H2734]] not [[H408]] when men prosper [[H6743]] in their ways, [[H1870]] [when they] [[H376]] carry out [[H6213]] wicked schemes. [[H4209]]

###### 8
Refrain [[H7503]] from anger [[H639]] and abandon [[H5800]] wrath; [[H2534]] do not [[H408]] fret— [[H2734]] it can only [[H389]] bring harm. [[H7489]]

###### 9
For [[H3588]] the evildoers [[H7489]] will be cut off, [[H3772]] but those who hope [[H6960]] in the LORD [[H3068]] will inherit [[H3423]] the land. [[H776]]

###### 10
A little while, [[H5750]] and the wicked [[H7563]] will be no more; [[H369]] though you look [[H995]] for them, [[H5921]] they will not be found. [[H369]]

###### 11
But the meek [[H6035]] will inherit [[H3423]] the land [[H776]] and delight [[H6026]] in [[H5921]] abundant [[H7230]] prosperity. [[H7965]]

###### 12
The wicked [[H7563]] scheme [[H2161]] against the righteous [[H6662]] and gnash [[H2786]] their teeth [[H8127]] at them, [[H5921]]

###### 13
but the Lord [[H136]] laughs, [[H7832]] seeing [[H7200]] that [[H3588]] their day [[H3117]] is coming. [[H935]]

###### 14
The wicked [[H7563]] have drawn [[H6605]] the sword [[H2719]] and bent [[H1869]] the bow [[H7198]] to bring down [[H5307]] the poor [[H6041]] and needy, [[H34]] to slay [[H2873]] those whose ways [[H1870]] [are] upright. [[H3477]]

###### 15
[But] their swords [[H2719]] will pierce [[H935]] their own hearts, [[H3820]] and their bows [[H7198]] will be broken. [[H7665]]

###### 16
Better [is] [[H2896]] the little [[H4592]] of the righteous [[H6662]] than the abundance [[H1995]] of many [[H7227]] wicked. [[H7563]]

###### 17
For [[H3588]] the arms [[H2220]] of the wicked [[H7563]] will be broken, [[H7665]] but the LORD [[H3068]] upholds [[H5564]] the righteous. [[H6662]]

###### 18
The LORD [[H3068]] knows [[H3045]] the days [[H3117]] of the blameless, [[H8549]] and their inheritance [[H5159]] will last forever. [[H1961]]

###### 19
In the time [[H6256]] of evil [[H7451]] they will not [[H3808]] be ashamed, [[H954]] and in the days [[H3117]] of famine [[H7459]] they will be satisfied. [[H7646]]

###### 20
But [[H3588]] the wicked [[H7563]] and enemies [[H341]] of the LORD [[H3068]] will perish [[H6]] like the glory [[H3368]] of the fields. [[H3733]] They will vanish; [[H3615]] like smoke [[H6227]] they will fade away. [[H3615]]

###### 21
The wicked [[H7563]] borrow [[H3867]] and do not [[H3808]] repay, [[H7999]] but the righteous [[H6662]] are gracious [[H2603]] and giving. [[H5414]]

###### 22
Surely [[H3588]] those He blesses [[H1288]] will inherit [[H3423]] the land, [[H776]] but the cursed [[H7043]] will be destroyed. [[H3772]]

###### 23
The steps [[H4703]] of a man [[H1397]] are ordered [[H3559]] by the LORD, [[H3068]] and He delights [[H2654]] in his way. [[H1870]]

###### 24
Though [[H3588]] he falls, [[H5307]] he will not [[H3808]] be overwhelmed, [[H2904]] for [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] is holding [[H5564]] his hand. [[H3027]]

###### 25
I once was [[H1961]] young [[H5288]] and [[H1571]] now am old, [[H2204]] yet never [[H3808]] have I seen [[H7200]] the righteous [[H6662]] abandoned [[H5800]] or their children [[H2233]] begging [[H1245]] for bread. [[H3899]]

###### 26
They are [[H3605]] ever [[H3117]] generous [[H2603]] and quick to lend, [[H3867]] and their children [[H2233]] are a blessing. [[H1293]]

###### 27
Turn away [[H5493]] from evil [[H7451]] and do [[H6213]] good, [[H2896]] so that you will abide [[H7931]] forever. [[H5769]]

###### 28
For [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] loves [[H157]] justice [[H4941]] and will not [[H3808]] forsake [[H5800]] His saints. [[H2623]] They are preserved [[H8104]] forever, [[H5769]] but the offspring [[H2233]] of the wicked [[H7563]] will be cut off. [[H3772]]

###### 29
The righteous [[H6662]] will inherit [[H3423]] the land [[H776]] and dwell [[H7931]] in it [[H5921]] forever. [[H5703]]

###### 30
The mouth [[H6310]] of the righteous man [[H6662]] utters [[H1897]] wisdom, [[H2451]] and his tongue [[H3956]] speaks [[H1696]] justice. [[H4941]]

###### 31
The law [[H8451]] of his God [[H430]] is in his heart; [[H3820]] his steps [[H838]] do not [[H3808]] falter. [[H4571]]

###### 32
Though the wicked [[H7563]] lie in wait [[H6822]] for the righteous, [[H6662]] and seek [[H1245]] to slay them, [[H4191]]

###### 33
the LORD [[H3068]] will not [[H3808]] leave them [[H5800]] in their power [[H3027]] or [[H3808]] let them be condemned [[H7561]] under judgment. [[H8199]]

###### 34
Wait [[H6960]] for [[H413]] the LORD [[H3068]] and keep [[H8104]] His way, [[H1870]] and He will raise you up [[H7311]] to inherit [[H3423]] the land. [[H776]] When the wicked [[H7563]] are cut off, [[H3772]] you will see [it]. [[H7200]]

###### 35
I have seen [[H7200]] a wicked, [[H7563]] ruthless man [[H6184]] flourishing [[H7488]] like a well-rooted [[H6168]] native tree, [[H249]]

###### 36
yet he passed away [[H5674]] and was no more; [[H369]] though I searched, [[H1245]] he could not [[H3808]] be found. [[H4672]]

###### 37
Consider [[H8104]] the blameless [[H8535]] and observe [[H7200]] the upright, [[H3477]] for [[H3588]] a posterity [awaits] [[H319]] the man [[H376]] of peace. [[H7965]]

###### 38
But the transgressors [[H6586]] will all [[H3162]] be destroyed; [[H8045]] the future [[H319]] of the wicked [[H7563]] will be cut off. [[H3772]]

###### 39
The salvation [[H8668]] of the righteous [[H6662]] [is] from the LORD; [[H3068]] [He is] their stronghold [[H4581]] in time [[H6256]] of trouble. [[H6869]]

###### 40
The LORD [[H3068]] helps [[H5826]] and delivers them; [[H6403]] He rescues [[H6403]] and saves them [[H3467]] from the wicked, [[H7563]] because [[H3588]] they take refuge [[H2620]] in Him.
