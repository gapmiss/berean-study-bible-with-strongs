Let the heavens [[H8064]] be glad [[H8055]] and the earth [[H776]] rejoice; [[H1523]] let the sea [[H3220]] resound, [[H7481]] and all that fills it. [[H4393]]

Let the fields [[H7704]] exult, [[H5937]] and all [[H3605]] that [is] [[H834]] in them.  Then [[H227]] all [[H3605]] the trees [[H6086]] of the forest [[H3293]] will sing for joy [[H7442]]
