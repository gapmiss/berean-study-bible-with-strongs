###### 1
For the choirmaster. [[H5329]] A Maskil [[H4905]] of David. [[H1732]] After Doeg [[H1673]] the Edomite [[H130]] went [[H935]] to Saul [[H7586]] and told [[H5046]] him,  “David [[H1732]] has gone [[H935]] to [[H413]] the house [[H1004]] of Ahimelech.” [[H288]] Why [[H4100]] do you boast [[H1984]] of evil, [[H7451]] O mighty man? [[H1368]] The loving devotion [[H2617]] of God [[H410]] [endures] all [[H3605]] day long. [[H3117]]

###### 2
Your tongue [[H3956]] devises [[H2803]] destruction [[H1942]] like a sharpened [[H3913]] razor, [[H8593]] O worker [[H6213]] of deceit. [[H7423]]

###### 3
You love [[H157]] evil [[H7451]] more than good, [[H2896]] falsehood [[H8267]] more than speaking [[H1696]] the truth. [[H6664]] Selah [[H5542]]

###### 4
You love [[H157]] every [[H3605]] word [[H1697]] that devours, [[H1105]] O deceitful [[H4820]] tongue. [[H3956]]

###### 5
Surely [[H1571]] God [[H410]] will bring you down [[H5422]] to everlasting ruin; [[H5331]] He will snatch you up [[H2846]] and tear you away [[H5255]] from [your] tent; [[H168]] He will uproot you [[H8327]] from the land [[H776]] of the living. [[H2416]] Selah [[H5542]]

###### 6
The righteous [[H6662]] will see [[H7200]] and fear; [[H3372]] they will mock [the evildoer], saying, [[H7832]]

###### 7
“Look at [[H2009]] the man [[H1397]] who did not [[H3808]] make [[H7760]] God [[H430]] his refuge, [[H4581]] but trusted [[H982]] in the abundance [[H7230]] of his wealth, [[H6239]] who strengthened himself [[H5810]] by bringing destruction.” [[H1942]]

###### 8
But I [[H589]] am like an olive tree [[H2132]] flourishing [[H7488]] in the house [[H1004]] of God; [[H430]] I trust [[H982]] in the loving devotion [[H2617]] of God [[H430]] forever [[H5769]] and ever. [[H5703]]

###### 9
I will praise You [[H3034]] forever, [[H5769]] because [[H3588]] You have done it. [[H6213]] I will wait on [[H6960]] Your name— [[H8034]] for [[H3588]] it is good— [[H2896]] in the presence [[H5048]] of Your saints. [[H2623]]
