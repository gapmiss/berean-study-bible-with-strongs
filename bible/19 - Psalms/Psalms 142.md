###### 1
A Maskil [[H4905]] of David, [[H1732]] when he was [[H1961]] in the cave. [[H4631]] A prayer. [[H8605]] I cry [[H2199]] aloud [[H6963]] to [[H413]] the LORD; [[H3068]] I lift my voice [[H6963]] to [[H413]] the LORD [[H3068]] for mercy. [[H2603]]

###### 2
I pour out [[H8210]] my complaint [[H7879]] before Him; [[H6440]] I reveal [[H5046]] my trouble [[H6869]] to Him. [[H6440]]

###### 3
Although my spirit [[H7307]] grows faint [[H5848]] within me, [[H5921]] You [[H859]] know [[H3045]] my way. [[H5410]] Along the path [[H734]] I travel [[H1980]] they have hidden [[H2934]] a snare [[H6341]] for me. 

###### 4
Look [[H5027]] to my right [[H3225]] and see, [[H7200]] no one [[H369]] attends to me; [[H5234]] there is no [[H6]] refuge [[H4498]] for me, [[H4480]] no one [[H369]] cares [[H1875]] for my soul. [[H5315]]

###### 5
I cry [[H2199]] to You, [[H413]] O LORD: [[H3068]] “You [[H859]] [are] my refuge, [[H4268]] my portion [[H2506]] in the land [[H776]] of the living.” [[H2416]]

###### 6
Listen [[H7181]] to [[H413]] my cry, [[H7440]] for [[H3588]] I am brought [[H1809]] quite low. [[H3966]] Rescue [[H5337]] me from [[H4480]] my pursuers, [[H7291]] for [[H3588]] they are too strong for me. [[H553]]

###### 7
Free [[H3318]] my soul [[H5315]] from prison [[H4525]] that I may praise [[H3034]] Your name. [[H8034]] The righteous [[H6662]] will gather around me [[H3803]] because [[H3588]] of Your goodness [[H1580]] to me. [[H5921]]
