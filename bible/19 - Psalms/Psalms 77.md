### 1
For the choirmaster. [[H5329]] According to [[H5921]] Jeduthun. [[H3038]] A Psalm [[H4210]] of Asaph. [[H623]] I cried aloud [[H6963]] to [[H413]] God, [[H430]] I cried out [[H6817]] to [[H413]] God [[H430]] to hear [[H238]] me. [[H413]]

### 2
In the day [[H3117]] of trouble [[H6869]] I sought [[H1875]] the Lord; [[H136]] through the night [[H3915]] my outstretched hands [[H3027]] did not grow weary; [[H6313]] my soul [[H5315]] refused [[H3985]] to be comforted. [[H5162]]

### 3
I remembered You, [[H2142]] O God, [[H430]] and I groaned; [[H1993]] I mused [[H7878]] [and] my spirit [[H7307]] grew faint. [[H5848]] Selah [[H5542]]

### 4
You have kept [[H270]] my eyes [[H5869]] from closing; [[H8109]] I am too troubled [[H6470]] to speak. [[H1696]]

### 5
I considered [[H2803]] days [[H3117]] of old, [[H6924]] years [[H8141]] long in the past. [[H5769]]

### 6
At night [[H3915]] I remembered [[H2142]] my song; [[H5058]] in [[H5973]] my heart [[H3824]] I mused, [[H7878]] [and] my spirit [[H7307]] pondered: [[H2664]]

### 7
“Will the Lord [[H136]] spurn [us] [[H2186]] forever [[H5769]] and never [[H3808]] show His favor again? [[H7521]]

### 8
Is His loving devotion [[H2617]] gone [[H656]] forever? [[H5331]] Has His promise [[H562]] failed [[H1584]] for all time? [[H1755]]

### 9
Has God [[H410]] forgotten [[H7911]] to be gracious? [[H2589]] Has His anger [[H639]] shut off [[H7092]] His compassion?” [[H7356]] Selah [[H5542]]

### 10
So I said, [[H559]] “I am grieved [[H2470]] that the right hand [[H3225]] of the Most High [[H5945]] has changed.” [[H1931]]

### 11
I will remember [[H2142]] the works [[H4611]] of the LORD; [[H3050]] yes, [[H3588]] I will remember [[H2142]] Your wonders [[H6382]] of old. [[H6924]]

### 12
I will reflect [[H1897]] on all [[H3605]] You have done [[H6467]] and ponder [[H7878]] Your mighty deeds. [[H5949]]

### 13
Your way, [[H1870]] O God, [[H430]] is holy. [[H6944]] What [[H4310]] god [[H410]] [is so] great [[H1419]] as [our] God? [[H430]]

### 14
You [[H859]] are the God [[H410]] who works [[H6213]] wonders; [[H6382]] You display [[H3045]] Your strength [[H5797]] among the peoples. [[H5971]]

### 15
With power [[H2220]] You redeemed [[H1350]] Your people, [[H5971]] the sons [[H1121]] of Jacob [[H3290]] and Joseph. [[H3130]] Selah [[H5542]]

### 16
The waters [[H4325]] saw You, [[H7200]] O God; [[H430]] the waters [[H4325]] saw You [[H7200]] and swirled; [[H2342]] even [[H637]] the depths [[H8415]] were shaken. [[H7264]]

### 17
The clouds [[H5645]] poured down [[H2229]] water; [[H4325]] the skies [[H7834]] resounded [[H5414]] with thunder; [[H6963]] Your arrows [[H2687]] flashed back and forth. [[H1980]]

### 18
Your thunder [[H7482]] resounded [[H6963]] in the whirlwind; [[H1534]] the lightning [[H1300]] lit up [[H215]] the world; [[H8398]] the earth [[H776]] trembled [[H7264]] and quaked. [[H7493]]

### 19
Your path [[H1870]] led through the sea, [[H3220]] Your way [[H7635]] through the mighty [[H7227]] waters, [[H4325]] but Your footprints [[H6119]] were not [[H3808]] to be found. [[H3045]]

### 20
You led [[H5148]] Your people [[H5971]] like a flock [[H6629]] by the hand [[H3027]] of Moses [[H4872]] and Aaron. [[H175]]
