###### 1
Vindicate me, [[H8199]] O God, [[H430]] and plead [[H7378]] my case [[H7379]] against an ungodly [[H3808]] nation; [[H1471]] deliver me [[H6403]] from deceitful [[H4820]] and unjust [[H5766]] men. [[H376]]

###### 2
For [[H3588]] You [[H859]] are the God [[H430]] of my refuge. [[H4581]] Why [[H4100]] have You rejected me? [[H2186]] Why [[H4100]] must I walk [[H1980]] in sorrow [[H6937]] because of the enemy’s [[H341]] oppression? [[H3906]]

###### 3
Send out [[H7971]] Your light [[H216]] and Your truth; [[H571]] let them [[H1992]] lead me. [[H5148]] Let them bring me [[H935]] to [[H413]] Your holy [[H6944]] mountain, [[H2022]] and to [[H413]] the place where You dwell. [[H4908]]

###### 4
Then I will go [[H935]] to [[H413]] the altar [[H4196]] of God, [[H430]] to [[H413]] God, [[H410]] my greatest joy. [[H8057]] I will praise [[H3034]] You with the harp, [[H3658]] O God, [[H430]] my God. [[H430]]

###### 5
Why [[H4100]] are you downcast, [[H7817]] O my soul? [[H5315]] Why [[H4100]] the unease [[H1993]] within me? [[H5921]] Put your hope [[H3176]] in God, [[H430]] for [[H3588]] I shall yet [[H5750]] praise Him, [[H3034]] my Savior [[H3444]] and my God. [[H430]]
