[[Psalms 119|←]] • [[Psalms 121|→]]

---

### 1
A Song [[H7892]] of Ascents. [[H4609]] In my distress [[H6869]] I cried [[H7121]] to [[H413]] the LORD, [[H3068]] and He answered me. [[H6030]]

### 2
Deliver [[H5337]] my soul, [[H5315]] O LORD, [[H3068]] from lying [[H8267]] lips [[H8193]] and a deceitful [[H7423]] tongue. [[H3956]]

### 3
What [[H4100]] will He do to you, [[H5414]] and what [[H4100]] will be added [[H3254]] to you,  O deceitful [[H7423]] tongue? [[H3956]]

### 4
Sharp [[H8150]] arrows [[H2671]] from the warrior, [[H1368]] with [[H5973]] burning coals [[H1513]] of juniper! [[H7574]]

### 5
Woe [[H190]] to me  that [[H3588]] I dwell [[H1481]] in Meshech, [[H4902]] that I live [[H7931]] among [[H5973]] the tents [[H168]] of Kedar! [[H6938]]

### 6
Too long [[H7227]] have I [[H5315]] dwelt [[H7931]] among [[H5973]] those who hate [[H8130]] peace. [[H7965]]

### 7
I [[H589]] [am in favor of] peace; [[H7965]] but when [[H3588]] I speak, [[H1696]] they [[H1992]] [want] war. [[H4421]]
