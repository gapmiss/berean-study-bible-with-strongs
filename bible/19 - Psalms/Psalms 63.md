### 1
A Psalm [[H4210]] of David, [[H1732]] when he was [[H1961]] in the Wilderness [[H4057]] of Judah. [[H3063]] O God, [[H430]] You are my God, [[H410]] earnestly I seek [[H7836]] You; [[H859]] my  soul [[H5315]] thirsts for You; [[H6770]] my  body [[H1320]] yearns for You [[H3642]] in a dry [[H6723]] and weary [[H5889]] land [[H776]] without [[H1097]] water. [[H4325]]

### 2
So [[H3651]] I have seen You [[H2372]] in the sanctuary, [[H6944]] to behold [[H7200]] Your power [[H5797]] and glory. [[H3519]]

### 3
Because [[H3588]] Your loving devotion [[H2617]] is better [[H2896]] than life, [[H2416]] my lips [[H8193]] will glorify You. [[H7623]]

### 4
So [[H3651]] I will bless You [[H1288]] as long as I live; [[H2416]] in Your name [[H8034]] I will lift [[H5375]] my hands. [[H3709]]

### 5
My soul [[H5315]] is satisfied [[H7646]] as [[H3644]] with the richest [[H2459]] of foods; [[H1880]] with joyful [[H7445]] lips [[H8193]] my mouth [[H6310]] will praise You. [[H1984]]

### 6
When [[H518]] I remember You [[H2142]] on [[H5921]] my bed, [[H3326]] I think [[H1897]] of You  through the watches of the night. [[H821]]

### 7
For [[H3588]] You are [[H1961]] my help; [[H5833]] I will sing for joy [[H7442]] in the shadow [[H6738]] of Your wings. [[H3671]]

### 8
My soul [[H5315]] clings [[H1692]] to You; [[H310]] Your right hand [[H3225]] upholds me. [[H8551]]

### 9
But those [[H1992]] who seek [[H1245]] my life [[H5315]] to destroy it [[H7722]] will go [[H935]] into the depths [[H8482]] of the earth. [[H776]]

### 10
They will fall [[H5064]] to [[H5921]] the power [[H3027]] of the sword; [[H2719]] they will become [[H1961]] the portion [[H4521]] of jackals. [[H7776]]

### 11
But the king [[H4428]] will rejoice [[H8055]] in God; [[H430]] all [[H3605]] who swear [[H7650]] by Him  will exult, [[H1984]] for [[H3588]] the mouths [[H6310]] of liars [[H1696]] will be shut. [[H5534]]
