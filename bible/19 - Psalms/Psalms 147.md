### 1
Hallelujah! [[H1984]] How [[H3588]] good [it is] [[H2896]] to sing praises [[H2167]] to our God, [[H430]] for [[H3588]] praise [[H8416]] is pleasant [[H5273]] and lovely. [[H5000]]

### 2
The LORD [[H3068]] builds up [[H1129]] Jerusalem; [[H3389]] He gathers [[H3664]] the exiles [[H1760]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

### 3
He heals [[H7495]] the brokenhearted [[H7665]] and binds [[H2280]] up their wounds. [[H6094]]

### 4
He determines [[H4487]] the number [[H4557]] of the stars; [[H3556]] He calls [[H7121]] them each [[H3605]] by name. [[H8034]]

### 5
Great [[H1419]] [is] our Lord [[H113]] and mighty [[H7227]] in power; [[H3581]] His understanding [[H8394]] has no [[H369]] limit. [[H4557]]

### 6
The LORD [[H3068]] sustains [[H5749]] the afflicted, [[H6035]] [but] casts [[H8213]] the wicked [[H7563]] to the ground. [[H776]]

### 7
Sing [[H6030]] to the LORD [[H3068]] with thanksgiving; [[H8426]] make music [[H2167]] on the harp [[H3658]] to our God, [[H430]]

### 8
who covers [[H3680]] the sky [[H8064]] with clouds, [[H5645]] who prepares [[H3559]] rain [[H4306]] for the earth, [[H776]] who makes grass [[H2682]] to grow [[H6779]] on the hills. [[H2022]]

### 9
He provides [[H5414]] food [[H3899]] for the animals, [[H929]] and for the young [[H1121]] ravens [[H6158]] when they call. [[H7121]]

### 10
He does not [[H3808]] delight [[H2654]] in the strength [[H1369]] of the horse; [[H5483]] He takes no [[H3808]] pleasure [[H7521]] in the legpower [[H7785]] of the man. [[H376]]

### 11
The LORD [[H3068]] is pleased [[H7521]] with those who fear Him, [[H3373]] who hope [[H3176]] in His loving devotion. [[H2617]]

### 12
Exalt [[H7623]] the LORD, [[H3068]] O Jerusalem; [[H3389]] praise [[H1984]] your God, [[H430]] O Zion! [[H6726]]

### 13
For [[H3588]] He strengthens [[H2388]] the bars [[H1280]] of your gates [[H8179]] and blesses [[H1288]] the children [[H1121]] within you. [[H7130]]

### 14
He makes [[H7760]] peace [[H7965]] [at] your borders; [[H1366]] He fills you [[H7646]] with the finest [[H2459]] wheat. [[H2406]]

### 15
He sends forth [[H7971]] His command [[H565]] to [[H5704]] the earth; [[H776]] His word [[H1697]] runs [[H7323]] swiftly. [[H4120]]

### 16
He spreads [[H5414]] the snow [[H7950]] like wool; [[H6785]] He scatters [[H6340]] the frost [[H3713]] like ashes; [[H665]]

### 17
He casts forth [[H7993]] His hail [[H7140]] like pebbles. [[H6595]] Who [[H4310]] can withstand [[H6440]] His icy blast? [[H7135]]

### 18
He sends forth [[H7971]] His word [[H1697]] and melts them; [[H4529]] He unleashes [[H5380]] His winds, [[H7307]] and the waters [[H4325]] flow. [[H5140]]

### 19
He declares [[H5046]] His word [[H1697]] to Jacob, [[H3290]] His statutes [[H2706]] and judgments [[H4941]] to Israel. [[H3478]]

### 20
He has done [[H6213]] this [[H3651]] for no other [[H3605]] nation; [[H1471]] they do not [[H1077]] know [[H3045]] His judgments. [[H4941]] Hallelujah! [[H1984]]
