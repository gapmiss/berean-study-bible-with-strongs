###### 1
A Prayer [[H8605]] of David. [[H1732]] Hear, [[H8085]] O LORD, [[H3068]] my righteous plea; [[H6664]] listen [[H7181]] to my cry. [[H7440]] Give ear [[H238]] to my prayer [[H8605]] from lips [[H8193]] free of [[H3808]] deceit. [[H4820]]

###### 2
May my vindication [[H4941]] come [[H3318]] from Your presence; [[H6440]] may Your eyes [[H5869]] see [[H2372]] what is right. [[H4339]]

###### 3
You have tried [[H974]] my heart; [[H3820]] You have visited [[H6485]] [me] in the night. [[H3915]] You have tested me [[H6884]] and found [[H4672]] no [evil]; [[H1077]] I have resolved [[H2161]] not [[H1077]] to sin [[H5674]] with my mouth. [[H6310]]

###### 4
As for the deeds [[H6468]] of men— [[H120]] by the word [[H1697]] of Your lips [[H8193]] I [[H589]] have avoided [[H8104]] the ways [[H734]] of the violent. [[H6530]]

###### 5
My steps [[H838]] have clung [[H8551]] to Your paths; [[H4570]] my feet [[H6471]] have not [[H1077]] slipped. [[H4131]]

###### 6
I [[H589]] call on You, [[H7121]] O God, [[H410]] for [[H3588]] You will answer me. [[H6030]] Incline [[H5186]] Your ear [[H241]] to me;  hear [[H8085]] my words. [[H565]]

###### 7
Show the wonders [[H6395]] of Your loving devotion, [[H2617]] You who save [[H3467]] by Your right hand [[H3225]] those who seek refuge [[H2620]] from their foes. [[H6965]]

###### 8
Keep me [[H8104]] as the apple [[H380]] of Your eye; [[H5869]] hide [[H5641]] me in the shadow [[H6738]] of Your wings [[H3671]]

###### 9
from [[H6440]] the wicked [[H7563]] who [[H2098]] assail me, [[H7703]] from my mortal [[H5315]] enemies [[H341]] who surround me. [[H5362]]

###### 10
They have closed [[H5462]] their callous [hearts]; [[H2459]] their mouths [[H6310]] speak [[H1696]] with arrogance. [[H1348]]

###### 11
They have tracked us down, [[H838]] and now [[H6258]] surround us; [[H5437]] their eyes [[H5869]] are set [[H7896]] to cast [us] [[H5186]] to the ground, [[H776]]

###### 12
like a lion [[H738]] greedy [[H3700]] for prey, [[H2963]] like a young lion [[H3715]] lurking [[H3427]] in ambush. [[H4565]]

###### 13
Arise, [[H6965]] O LORD, [[H3068]] confront [[H6923]] them! [[H6440]] Bring them to their knees; [[H3766]] deliver [[H6403]] me [[H5315]] from the wicked [[H7563]] by Your sword, [[H2719]]

###### 14
from such men, [[H4962]] O LORD, [[H3068]] by Your hand, [[H3027]] from men [[H4962]] of the world [[H2465]] whose portion [[H2506]] is in this life. [[H2416]] You  fill [[H4390]] their bellies [[H990]] with Your treasure [[H6840]] and satisfy [[H7646]] their sons; [[H1121]] so they leave [[H3240]] their abundance [[H3499]] to their children. [[H5768]]

###### 15
As for me, [[H589]] I will behold [[H2372]] Your face [[H6440]] in righteousness; [[H6664]] when I awake, [[H6974]] I will be satisfied [[H7646]] with Your presence. [[H8544]]
