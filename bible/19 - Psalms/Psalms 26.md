### 1
Of David. [[H1732]] Vindicate me, [[H8199]] O LORD! [[H3068]] For [[H3588]] I [[H589]] have walked [[H1980]] with integrity; [[H8537]] I have trusted [[H982]] in the LORD [[H3068]] without [[H3808]] wavering. [[H4571]]

### 2
Test me, [[H974]] O LORD, [[H3068]] and try me; [[H5254]] examine [[H6884]] my heart [[H3629]] and mind. [[H3820]]

### 3
For [[H3588]] Your loving devotion [[H2617]] is before [[H5048]] my eyes, [[H5869]] and I have walked [[H1980]] in Your truth. [[H571]]

### 4
I do not [[H3808]] sit [[H3427]] with [[H5973]] deceitful [[H7723]] men, [[H4962]] nor [[H3808]] keep company [[H935]] with [[H5973]] hypocrites. [[H5956]]

### 5
I hate [[H8130]] the mob [[H6951]] of evildoers, [[H7489]] and refuse [[H3808]] to sit [[H3427]] with [[H5973]] the wicked. [[H7563]]

### 6
I wash [[H7364]] my hands [[H3709]] in innocence [[H5356]] that I may come near [[H5437]] Your altar, [[H4196]] O LORD, [[H3068]]

### 7
to raise [[H8085]] my voice [[H6963]] in thanksgiving [[H8426]] and declare [[H5608]] all [[H3605]] Your wonderful works. [[H6381]]

### 8
O LORD, [[H3068]] I love [[H157]] the house [[H1004]] where You dwell, [[H4583]] the place [[H4725]] where Your glory [[H3519]] resides. [[H4908]]

### 9
Do not [[H408]] take [[H622]] my soul [[H5315]] away with [[H5973]] sinners, [[H2400]] or my life [[H2416]] with [[H5973]] men [[H376]] of bloodshed, [[H1818]]

### 10
in whose [[H834]] hands [[H3027]] are wicked schemes, [[H2154]] whose right hands [[H3225]] are full [[H4390]] of bribes. [[H7810]]

### 11
But I [[H589]] will walk [[H1980]] with integrity; [[H8537]] redeem me [[H6299]] and be merciful to me. [[H2603]]

### 12
My feet [[H7272]] stand [[H5975]] on level ground; [[H4334]] in the congregations [[H4721]] I will bless [[H1288]] the LORD. [[H3068]]
