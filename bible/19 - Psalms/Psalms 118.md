### 1
Give thanks [[H3034]] to the LORD, [[H3068]] for [[H3588]] He is good; [[H2896]] His loving devotion [[H2617]] endures forever. [[H5769]]

### 2
Let Israel [[H3478]] say, [[H559]] “His loving devotion [[H2617]] endures forever.” [[H5769]]

### 3
Let the house [[H1004]] of Aaron [[H175]] say, [[H559]] “His loving devotion [[H2617]] endures forever.” [[H5769]]

Let those who fear [[H3373]] the LORD [[H3068]] say, [[H559]] “His loving devotion [[H2617]] endures forever.” [[H5769]]

### 5
In [[H4480]] [my] distress [[H4712]] I called [[H7121]] to the LORD, [[H3050]] [and He] [[H3050]] answered [[H6030]] [and set me] free. [[H4800]]

### 6
The LORD is [[H3068]] with me;  I will not [[H3808]] be afraid. [[H3372]] What [[H4100]] can man [[H120]] do [[H6213]] to me? 

### 7
The LORD is [[H3068]] with me;  He is my helper. [[H5826]] Therefore I [[H589]] will look in triumph [[H7200]] on those who hate me. [[H8130]]

### 8
It is better [[H2896]] to take refuge [[H2620]] in the LORD [[H3068]] than to trust [[H982]] in man. [[H120]]

### 9
It is better [[H2896]] to take refuge [[H2620]] in the LORD [[H3068]] than to trust [[H982]] in princes. [[H5081]]

### 10
All [[H3605]] the nations [[H1471]] surrounded me; [[H5437]] in the name [[H8034]] of the LORD [[H3068]] I will surely [[H3588]] cut them off. [[H4135]]

### 11
They surrounded me, [[H5437]] yes, [[H1571]] they surrounded me; [[H5437]] in the name [[H8034]] of the LORD [[H3068]] I will surely [[H3588]] cut them off. [[H4135]]

### 12
They swarmed around me [[H5437]] like bees; [[H1682]] they were extinguished [[H1846]] like a fire [[H784]] of thorns; [[H6975]] in the name [[H8034]] of the LORD [[H3068]] I will surely [[H3588]] cut them off. [[H4135]]

### 13
I was pushed [[H1760]] so hard [[H1760]] I was falling, [[H5307]] but the LORD [[H3068]] helped me. [[H5826]]

### 14
The LORD [[H3050]] is my strength [[H5797]] and my song, [[H2176]] and He has become [[H1961]] my  salvation. [[H3444]]

### 15
Shouts [[H6963]] of joy [[H7440]] and salvation [[H3444]] [resound] in the tents [[H168]] of the righteous: [[H6662]] “The right hand [[H3225]] of the LORD [[H3068]] performs [[H6213]] with valor! [[H2428]]

### 16
The right hand [[H3225]] of the LORD [[H3068]] is exalted! [[H7426]] The right hand [[H3225]] of the LORD [[H3068]] performs [[H6213]] with valor!” [[H2428]]

### 17
I will not [[H3808]] die, [[H4191]] but [[H3588]] I will live [[H2421]] and proclaim [[H5608]] what the LORD [[H3050]] has done. [[H4639]]

### 18
The LORD [[H3050]] disciplined [[H3256]] me severely, [[H3256]] but He has not [[H3808]] given me over [[H5414]] to death. [[H4194]]

### 19
Open [[H6605]] to me  the gates [[H8179]] of righteousness; [[H6664]] I will enter [[H935]] and give thanks [[H3034]] to the LORD. [[H3050]]

### 20
This [[H2088]] is the gate [[H8179]] of the LORD; [[H3068]] the righteous [[H6662]] shall enter [[H935]] through it. 

### 21
I will give You thanks, [[H3034]] for [[H3588]] You have answered me, [[H6030]] and You have become [[H1961]] my  salvation. [[H3444]]

### 22
The stone [[H68]] the builders [[H1129]] rejected [[H3988]] has become [[H1961]] the cornerstone. [[H7218]]

### 23
This [[H2063]] is [[H1961]] from the LORD, [[H3068]] [and] it [[H1931]] [is] marvelous [[H6381]] in our eyes. [[H5869]]

### 24
This [[H2088]] is the day [[H3117]] [that] the LORD [[H3068]] has made; [[H6213]] we will rejoice [[H1523]] and be glad in it. [[H8055]]

### 25
O LORD, [[H3068]] save us, [[H3467]] we pray. [[H577]] We beseech You, [[H4994]] O LORD, [[H3068]] cause us to prosper! [[H6743]]

### 26
Blessed [is] [[H1288]] he who comes [[H935]] in the name [[H8034]] of the LORD. [[H3068]] From the house [[H1004]] of the LORD [[H3068]] we bless you. [[H1288]]

### 27
The LORD [[H3068]] is God [[H410]] and has made His light shine [[H216]] upon us.  Bind [[H631]] the festival sacrifice [[H2282]] with cords [[H5688]] to [[H5704]] the horns [[H7161]] of the altar. [[H4196]]

### 28
You [[H859]] are my God, [[H410]] and I will give You thanks. [[H3034]] You are my God, [[H430]] [and] I will exalt You. [[H7311]]

### 29
Give thanks [[H3034]] to the LORD, [[H3068]] for [[H3588]] He is good; [[H2896]] His loving devotion [[H2617]] endures forever. [[H5769]]
