### 1
Of David. [[H1732]] To You, [[H413]] O LORD, [[H3068]] I lift [[H5375]] up my soul; [[H5315]]

### 2
In You,  my God, [[H430]] I trust. [[H982]] Let me not [[H408]] be ashamed, [[H954]] nor [[H408]] let my enemies [[H341]] exult over me. [[H5970]]

### 3
Surely [[H1571]] none [[H3808]] who wait for You [[H6960]] will be put to shame; [[H954]] [but] those who are faithless [[H898]] without cause [[H7387]] will be disgraced. [[H954]]

### 4
Show me [[H3045]] Your ways, [[H1870]] O LORD; [[H3068]] teach me [[H3925]] Your paths. [[H734]]

### 5
Guide me [[H1869]] in Your truth [[H571]] and teach me, [[H3925]] for [[H3588]] You [[H859]] are the God [[H430]] of my salvation; [[H3468]] all [[H3605]] day long [[H3117]] I wait [[H6960]] for You. [[H854]]

### 6
Remember, [[H2142]] O LORD, [[H3068]] Your compassion [[H7356]] and loving devotion, [[H2617]] for [[H3588]] they [are] [[H1992]] from age to age. [[H5769]]

### 7
Remember [[H2142]] not [[H408]] the sins [[H2403]] of my youth, [[H5271]] or my rebellious acts; [[H6588]] remember me [[H2142]] according to  Your loving devotion, [[H2617]] because of [[H4616]] Your goodness, [[H2898]] O LORD. [[H3068]]

### 8
Good [[H2896]] and upright [[H3477]] [is] the LORD; [[H3068]] therefore [[H5921]] He shows [[H3384]] sinners [[H2400]] the way. [[H1870]]

### 9
He guides [[H1869]] the humble [[H6035]] in what is right [[H4941]] and teaches [[H3925]] them [[H6035]] His way. [[H1870]]

### 10
All [[H3605]] the LORD’s [[H3068]] ways [[H734]] [are] loving and faithful [[H2617]] to those who keep [[H5341]] His covenant [[H1285]] and His decrees. [[H5713]]

### 11
For the sake of [[H4616]] Your name, [[H8034]] O LORD, [[H3068]] forgive [[H5545]] my iniquity, [[H5771]] for [[H3588]] it [[H1931]] is great. [[H7227]]

### 12
Who [[H4310]] is the man [[H376]] who fears [[H3373]] the LORD? [[H3068]] He will instruct him [[H3384]] in the way [[H1870]] he should choose. [[H977]]

### 13
His soul [[H5315]] will dwell [[H3885]] in prosperity, [[H2896]] and his descendants [[H2233]] will inherit [[H3423]] the land. [[H776]]

### 14
The LORD [[H3068]] confides [[H5475]] in those who fear Him, [[H3373]] and reveals [[H3045]] His covenant to them. [[H1285]]

### 15
My eyes [[H5869]] are always [[H8548]] on [[H413]] the LORD, [[H3068]] for [[H3588]] He [[H1931]] will free [[H3318]] my feet [[H7272]] from the mesh. [[H7568]]

### 16
Turn [[H6437]] to me [[H413]] and be gracious, [[H2603]] for [[H3588]] I [[H589]] am lonely [[H3173]] and afflicted. [[H6041]]

### 17
The troubles [[H6869]] of my heart [[H3824]] increase; [[H7337]] free me [[H3318]] from my distress. [[H4691]]

### 18
Consider [[H7200]] my affliction [[H6040]] and trouble, [[H5999]] and take away [[H5375]] all [[H3605]] my sins. [[H2403]]

### 19
Consider [[H7200]] my enemies, [[H341]] for [[H3588]] they are many, [[H7231]] and they hate me [[H8130]] with vicious [[H2555]] hatred. [[H8135]]

### 20
Guard [[H8104]] my soul [[H5315]] and deliver me; [[H5337]] let me not [[H408]] be put to shame, [[H954]] for [[H3588]] I take refuge [[H2620]] in You. 

### 21
May integrity [[H8537]] and uprightness [[H3476]] preserve me, [[H5341]] because [[H3588]] I wait for You. [[H6960]]

### 22
Redeem [[H6299]] Israel, [[H3478]] O God, [[H430]] from all [[H3605]] its distress. [[H6869]]
