###### 1
For the choirmaster. [[H5329]] A Psalm [[H4210]] of David. [[H1732]] O God [[H430]] of my praise, [[H8416]] do not [[H408]] be silent. [[H2790]]

###### 2
For [[H3588]] wicked [[H7563]] and deceitful [[H4820]] mouths [[H6310]] open [[H6605]] against me; [[H5921]] they speak [[H1696]] against [[H854]] me with lying [[H8267]] tongues. [[H3956]]

###### 3
They surround [[H5437]] me with hateful [[H8135]] words [[H1697]] and attack [[H3898]] me without cause. [[H2600]]

###### 4
In return for [[H8478]] my love [[H160]] they accuse me, [[H7853]] but I [am a man] [[H589]] [of] prayer. [[H8605]]

###### 5
They repay [[H7760]] me evil [[H7451]] for [[H8478]] good, [[H2896]] and hatred [[H8135]] for [[H8478]] my love. [[H160]]

###### 6
Set [[H6485]] over him [[H5921]] a wicked man; [[H7563]] let an accuser [[H7854]] stand [[H5975]] at [[H5921]] his right hand. [[H3225]]

###### 7
When he is tried, [[H8199]] let him be found guilty, [[H7563]] and may his prayer [[H8605]] be regarded [[H1961]] as sin. [[H2401]]

###### 8
May his days [[H3117]] be [[H1961]] few; [[H4592]] may another [[H312]] take [[H3947]] his position. [[H6486]]

###### 9
May his children [[H1121]] be [[H1961]] fatherless [[H3490]] and his wife [[H802]] a widow. [[H490]]

###### 10
May his children [[H1121]] wander [[H5128]] as beggars; [[H7592]] may they seek sustenance [[H1875]] far from their ruined homes. [[H2723]]

###### 11
May the creditor [[H5383]] seize [[H5367]] all [[H3605]] he owns,  and strangers [[H2114]] plunder [[H962]] the fruits of his labor. [[H3018]]

###### 12
May there be [[H1961]] none [[H408]] to  extend [[H4900]] kindness, [[H2617]] [and] [[H1961]] no one [[H408]] to favor [[H2603]] his fatherless children. [[H3490]]

###### 13
May his descendants [[H319]] be [[H1961]] cut off; [[H3772]] may their name [[H8034]] be blotted out [[H4229]] from the next [[H312]] generation. [[H1755]]

###### 14
May the iniquity [[H5771]] of his fathers [[H1]] be remembered [[H2142]] before [[H413]] the LORD, [[H3068]] and the sin [[H2403]] of his mother [[H517]] never [[H408]] be erased. [[H4229]]

###### 15
May [their sins] always [[H8548]] remain [[H1961]] before [[H5048]] the LORD, [[H3068]] that He may cut off [[H3772]] their memory [[H2143]] from the earth. [[H776]]

###### 16
For [[H3282]] he never [[H3808]] thought [[H2142]] to show [[H6213]] kindness, [[H2617]] but pursued [[H7291]] the poor [[H6041]] and needy [[H34]] and [[H5218]] brokenhearted, [[H3824]] even to their death. [[H4191]]

###### 17
The cursing [[H7045]] he loved, [[H157]] may it fall on him; [[H935]] the blessing [[H1293]] he refused [[H3808]] to delight in, [[H2654]] may it be far [[H7368]] from him. [[H4480]]

###### 18
The cursing [[H7045]] he wore [[H3847]] like a coat, [[H4055]] may it soak into [[H935]] his body [[H7130]] like water, [[H4325]] and into his bones [[H6106]] like oil. [[H8081]]

###### 19
May it be [[H1961]] like a robe [[H899]] wrapped about him, [[H5844]] like a belt [[H4206]] tied [[H2296]] forever around him. [[H8548]]

###### 20
May this [[H2063]] be the LORD’s [[H3068]] reward [[H6468]] to my accusers, [[H7853]] to those who speak [[H1696]] evil [[H7451]] against [[H5921]] me. [[H5315]]

###### 21
But You, [[H859]] O GOD, [[H3069]] the Lord, [[H136]] deal [[H6213]] kindly with me [[H854]] for the sake of [[H4616]] Your name; [[H8034]] deliver me [[H5337]] by [[H3588]] the goodness [[H2896]] of Your loving devotion. [[H2617]]

###### 22
For [[H3588]] I [[H595]] [am] poor [[H6041]] and needy; [[H34]] my heart [[H3820]] is wounded [[H2490]] within me. [[H7130]]

###### 23
I am fading away [[H1980]] like a lengthening [[H5186]] shadow; [[H6738]] I am shaken off [[H5287]] like a locust. [[H697]]

###### 24
My knees [[H1290]] are weak [[H3782]] from fasting, [[H6685]] and my body [[H1320]] grows lean [[H3584]] and gaunt. [[H8081]]

###### 25
I [[H589]] am [[H1961]] an object of scorn [[H2781]] to [my accusers]; [[H1992]] when they see me, [[H7200]] they shake [[H5128]] their heads. [[H7218]]

###### 26
Help me, [[H5826]] O LORD [[H3068]] my God; [[H430]] save me [[H3467]] according to Your loving devotion. [[H2617]]

###### 27
Let them know [[H3045]] that this [[H3588]] [is] Your hand, [[H3027]] that [[H2063]] You, [[H859]] O LORD, [[H3068]] have done it. [[H6213]]

###### 28
Though they [[H1992]] curse, [[H7043]] You [[H859]] will bless. [[H1288]] When they rise up, [[H6965]] they will be put to shame, [[H954]] but Your servant [[H5650]] will rejoice. [[H8055]]

###### 29
My accusers [[H7853]] will be clothed [[H3847]] with disgrace; [[H3639]] they will wear [[H5844]] their shame [[H1322]] like a robe. [[H4598]]

###### 30
With my mouth [[H6310]] I will thank [[H3034]] the LORD [[H3068]] profusely; [[H3966]] I will praise Him [[H1984]] in the presence [[H8432]] of many. [[H7227]]

###### 31
For [[H3588]] He stands [[H5975]] at the right hand [[H3225]] of the needy one, [[H34]] to save him [[H3467]] from the condemners [[H8199]] of his soul. [[H5315]]
