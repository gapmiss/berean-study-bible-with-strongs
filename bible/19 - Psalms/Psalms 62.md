### 1
For the choirmaster. [[H5329]] According to [[H5921]] Jeduthun. [[H3038]] A Psalm [[H4210]] of David. [[H1732]] In [[H413]] God [[H430]] alone [[H389]] my soul [[H5315]] finds rest; [[H1747]] my salvation [[H3444]] comes from Him. [[H4480]]

### 2
He [[H1931]] alone [[H389]] is my rock [[H6697]] and my salvation; [[H3444]] [He is] my fortress, [[H4869]] I will never [[H3808]] be shaken. [[H4131]]

### 3
How long [[H5704]] will you threaten [[H2050]] a man? [[H376]] Will all [[H3605]] of you throw him down [[H7523]] like a leaning [[H5186]] wall [[H7023]] or a tottering [[H1760]] fence? [[H1447]]

### 4
They fully [[H389]] intend [[H3289]] to topple him [[H5080]] from his lofty perch; [[H7613]] they delight [[H7521]] in lies; [[H3577]] with their mouths [[H6310]] they bless, [[H1288]] but inwardly they curse. [[H7043]] Selah [[H5542]]

### 5
Rest [[H1826]] in God [[H430]] alone, [[H389]] O my soul, [[H5315]] for [[H3588]] my hope [[H8615]] comes from Him. [[H4480]]

### 6
He [[H1931]] alone [[H389]] is my rock [[H6697]] and my salvation; [[H3444]] [He is] my fortress, [[H4869]] I will not [[H3808]] be shaken. [[H4131]]

### 7
My salvation [[H3468]] and my honor [[H3519]] rest on [[H5921]] God, [[H430]] my strong [[H5797]] rock; [[H6697]] my refuge [[H4268]] is in God. [[H430]]

### 8
Trust [[H982]] in Him  at all [[H3605]] times, [[H6256]] O people; [[H5971]] pour out [[H8210]] your hearts [[H3824]] before Him. [[H6440]] God [[H430]] is our refuge. [[H4268]] Selah [[H5542]]

### 9
Lowborn [[H1121]] men [[H120]] [are] but [[H389]] a vapor; [[H1892]] the exalted [[H1121]] but a lie. [[H3577]] Weighed on the scale, [[H3976]] they [[H1992]] are pushed up; [[H5927]] together [[H3162]] they are but a breath. [[H1892]]

### 10
Place no [[H408]] trust [[H982]] in extortion, [[H6233]] or false hope [[H1891]] in stolen goods. [[H1498]] If [[H3588]] your riches [[H2428]] increase, [[H5107]] do not [[H408]] set [[H7896]] your heart [upon them]. [[H3820]]

### 11
God [[H430]] has spoken [[H1696]] once; [[H259]] I have heard [[H8085]] this [[H2098]] twice: [[H8147]] that power [[H5797]] belongs to God, [[H430]]

### 12
and loving devotion to You, [[H2617]] O Lord. [[H136]] For [[H3588]] You [[H859]] will repay [[H7999]] each man [[H376]] according to his deeds. [[H4639]]
