### 1
Give thanks [[H3034]] to the LORD, [[H3068]] call [[H7121]] upon His name; [[H8034]] make known [[H3045]] His deeds [[H5949]] among the nations. [[H5971]]

### 2
Sing [[H7891]] to Him,  sing praises [[H2167]] to Him;  tell [[H7878]] of all [[H3605]] His wonders. [[H6381]]

### 3
Glory [[H1984]] in His holy [[H6944]] name; [[H8034]] let the hearts [[H3820]] of those who seek [[H1245]] the LORD [[H3068]] rejoice. [[H8055]]

### 4
Seek out [[H1875]] the LORD [[H3068]] and His strength; [[H5797]] seek [[H1245]] His face [[H6440]] always. [[H8548]]

### 5
Remember [[H2142]] the wonders [[H6381]] He has done, [[H6213]] His marvels, [[H4159]] and the judgments [[H4941]] He has pronounced, [[H6310]]

### 6
O offspring [[H2233]] of Abraham [[H85]] His servant, [[H5650]] O sons [[H1121]] of Jacob, [[H3290]] His chosen ones. [[H972]]

### 7
He [[H1931]] is the LORD [[H3068]] our God; [[H430]] His judgments [carry] [[H4941]] throughout [[H3605]] the earth. [[H776]]

### 8
He remembers [[H2142]] His covenant [[H1285]] forever, [[H5769]] the word [[H1697]] He ordained [[H6680]] for a thousand [[H505]] generations— [[H1755]]

### 9
[the covenant] [[H834]] He made [[H3772]] with [[H854]] Abraham, [[H85]] and the oath He swore [[H7621]] to Isaac. [[H3446]]

### 10
He confirmed it [[H5975]] to Jacob [[H3290]] as a decree, [[H2706]] to Israel [[H3478]] as an everlasting [[H5769]] covenant: [[H1285]]

### 11
“I will give [[H5414]] you  the land [[H776]] of Canaan [[H3667]] as the portion [[H2256]] of your inheritance.” [[H5159]]

### 12
When they were [[H1961]] few [[H4962]] in number, [[H4557]] few indeed, [[H4592]] and strangers [[H1481]] in [the land], 

### 13
they wandered [[H1980]] from nation [[H1471]] to [[H413]] nation, [[H1471]] from [one] kingdom [[H4467]] to [[H413]] another. [[H312]]

### 14
He let [[H3240]] no [[H3808]] man [[H120]] oppress them; [[H6231]] He rebuked [[H3198]] kings [[H4428]] on their behalf: [[H5921]]

### 15
“Do not [[H408]] touch [[H5060]] My anointed ones; [[H4899]] do no harm [[H7489]] to My prophets.” [[H5030]]

### 16
He called down [[H7121]] famine [[H7458]] on [[H5921]] the land [[H776]] and cut off [[H7665]] all [[H3605]] their supplies [[H4294]] of food. [[H3899]]

### 17
He sent [[H7971]] a man [[H376]] before them— [[H6440]] Joseph, [[H3130]] sold [[H4376]] as a slave. [[H5650]]

### 18
They bruised [[H6031]] his feet [[H7272]] with shackles [[H3525]] [and] placed [[H935]] his neck [[H5315]] in irons, [[H1270]]

### 19
until [[H5704]] his prediction [[H1697]] came true, [[H935]] the word [[H565]] of the LORD [[H3068]] tested him. [[H6884]]

### 20
The king [[H4428]] sent [[H7971]] and released him; [[H5425]] the ruler [[H4910]] of peoples [[H5971]] set him free. [[H6605]]

### 21
He made [[H7760]] him master [[H113]] of his household, [[H1004]] ruler [[H4910]] over all [[H3605]] his substance, [[H7075]]

### 22
to instruct [[H631]] his princes [[H8269]] as he pleased [[H5315]] and teach [[H2449]] his elders {wisdom}. [[H2205]]

### 23
Then Israel [[H3478]] went [[H935]] to Egypt; [[H4714]] Jacob [[H3290]] sojourned [[H1481]] in the land [[H776]] of Ham. [[H2526]]

### 24
And the LORD made His people [[H5971]] very [[H3966]] fruitful, [[H6509]] more numerous [[H6105]] than their foes, [[H6862]]

### 25
whose hearts [[H3820]] He turned [[H2015]] to hate [[H8130]] His people, [[H5971]] to conspire [[H5230]] against His servants. [[H5650]]

### 26
He sent [[H7971]] Moses [[H4872]] His servant, [[H5650]] and Aaron, [[H175]] whom [[H834]] He had chosen. [[H977]]

### 27
They performed [[H7760]] His miraculous [[H226]] signs [[H1697]] among them,  and wonders [[H4159]] in the land [[H776]] of Ham. [[H2526]]

### 28
He sent [[H7971]] darkness, [[H2822]] and it became dark— [[H2821]] for had they not [[H3808]] defied [[H4784]] His words? [[H1697]]

### 29
He turned [[H2015]] their water [[H4325]] to blood [[H1818]] and caused their fish [[H1710]] to die. [[H4191]]

### 30
Their land [[H776]] teemed [[H8317]] with frogs, [[H6854]] even in their royal [[H4428]] chambers. [[H2315]]

### 31
He spoke, [[H559]] and insects [[H6157]] swarmed— [[H935]] gnats [[H3654]] throughout [[H3605]] their country. [[H1366]]

### 32
He gave [[H5414]] them hail [[H1259]] for rain, [[H1653]] with lightning [[H784]] throughout their land. [[H776]]

### 33
He struck [[H5221]] their vines [[H1612]] and fig trees [[H8384]] and shattered [[H7665]] the trees [[H6086]] of their country. [[H1366]]

### 34
He spoke, [[H559]] and the locusts [[H697]] came— [[H935]] young locusts [[H3218]] without [[H369]] number. [[H4557]]

### 35
They devoured [[H398]] every [[H3605]] plant [[H6212]] in their land [[H776]] and consumed [[H398]] the produce [[H6529]] of their soil. [[H127]]

### 36
Then He struck [[H5221]] all [[H3605]] the firstborn [[H1060]] in their land, [[H776]] the firstfruits [[H7225]] of all [[H3605]] their vigor. [[H202]]

### 37
Then He brought [Israel] out [[H3318]] with silver [[H3701]] and gold, [[H2091]] and none [[H369]] among His tribes [[H7626]] stumbled. [[H3782]]

### 38
Egypt [[H4714]] was glad [[H8055]] when they departed, [[H3318]] for [[H3588]] the dread [[H6343]] of Israel had fallen [[H5307]] on them. [[H5921]]

### 39
He spread [[H6566]] a cloud [[H6051]] as a covering [[H4539]] and a fire [[H784]] to light up [[H215]] the night. [[H3915]]

### 40
They asked, [[H7592]] and He brought [[H935]] quail [[H7958]] and satisfied them [[H7646]] with the bread [[H3899]] of heaven. [[H8064]]

### 41
He opened [[H6605]] a rock, [[H6697]] and water [[H4325]] gushed out; [[H2100]] it flowed [[H1980]] [like] a river [[H5104]] in the desert. [[H6723]]

### 42
For [[H3588]] He remembered [[H2142]] His holy [[H6944]] promise [[H1697]] to Abraham [[H85]] His servant. [[H5650]]

### 43
He brought forth His people [[H5971]] with rejoicing, [[H8342]] His chosen [[H972]] with shouts of joy. [[H7440]]

### 44
He gave [[H5414]] them the lands [[H776]] of the nations, [[H1471]] that they might inherit [[H3423]] the fruit of others’ labor, [[H5999]]

### 45
that [[H5668]] they might keep [[H8104]] His statutes [[H2706]] and observe [[H5341]] His laws. [[H8451]] Hallelujah! [[H1984]]
