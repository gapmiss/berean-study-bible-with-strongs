###### 1
Why [[H4100]] do the nations [[H1471]] rage [[H7283]] and the peoples [[H3816]] plot [[H1897]] in vain? [[H7385]]

###### 2
The kings [[H4428]] of the earth [[H776]] take their stand [[H3320]] and the rulers [[H7336]] gather [[H3245]] together, [[H3162]] against [[H5921]] the LORD [[H3068]] and against [[H5921]] His Anointed One: [[H4899]]

###### 3
“Let us break [[H5423]] Their chains [[H4147]] and cast away [[H7993]] Their cords.” [[H5688]]

###### 4
The One enthroned [[H3427]] in the heavens [[H8064]] laughs; [[H7832]] the Lord [[H136]] taunts them. [[H3932]]

###### 5
Then [[H227]] He rebukes [[H1696]] them [[H413]] in His anger, [[H639]] and terrifies them [[H926]] in His fury: [[H2740]]

###### 6
“I have [[H589]] installed [[H5258]] My King [[H4428]] on [[H5921]] Zion, [[H6726]] [upon] My holy [[H6944]] hill.” [[H2022]]

###### 7
I will proclaim [[H5608]] the decree [[H2706]] spoken [[H559]] to Me [[H413]] by the LORD: [[H3069]] “You [[H859]] [are] My Son; [[H1121]] today [[H3117]] I [[H589]] have become Your Father. [[H3205]]

###### 8
Ask [[H7592]] Me, [[H4480]] and I {will} make [[H5414]] the nations [[H1471]] Your inheritance, [[H5159]] the ends [[H657]] of the earth [[H776]] Your possession. [[H272]]

###### 9
You will break them [[H7489]] an iron [[H1270]] scepter; [[H7626]] You {will} shatter them [[H5310]] like pottery.” [[H3335]]

###### 10
Therefore [[H6258]] be wise, [[H7919]] O kings; [[H4428]] be admonished, [[H3256]] O judges [[H8199]] of the earth. [[H776]]

###### 11
Serve [[H5647]] the LORD [[H3068]] with fear, [[H3374]] and rejoice [[H1523]] with trembling. [[H7461]]

###### 12
Kiss [[H5401]] the Son, [[H1248]] lest [[H6435]] He be angry [[H599]] and you perish [[H6]] in your rebellion, [[H1870]] when [[H3588]] His wrath [[H639]] ignites [[H1197]] in an instant. [[H4592]] Blessed [[H835]] [are] all [[H3605]] who take refuge [[H2620]] in Him.
