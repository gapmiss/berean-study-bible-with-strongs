###### 1
Of David. [[H1732]] Blessed [[H1288]] [be] the LORD, [[H3068]] my rock, [[H6697]] who trains [[H3925]] my hands [[H3027]] for war, [[H7128]] my fingers [[H676]] for battle. [[H4421]]

###### 2
He is my loving devotion [[H2617]] and my fortress, [[H4686]] my stronghold [[H4869]] and my deliverer. [[H6403]] He is my shield, [[H4043]] in whom I take refuge, [[H2620]] who subdues [[H7286]] peoples [[H5971]] under me. [[H8478]]

###### 3
O LORD, [[H3069]] what [[H4100]] is man, [[H120]] that You regard him, [[H3045]] the son of man [[H1121]] that [[H376]] You think of him? [[H2803]]

###### 4
Man [[H120]] is like [[H1819]] a breath; [[H1892]] his days [[H3117]] are like a passing [[H5674]] shadow. [[H6738]]

###### 5
Part [[H5186]] Your heavens, [[H8064]] O LORD, [[H3068]] and come down; [[H3381]] touch [[H5060]] the mountains, [[H2022]] that they may smoke. [[H6225]]

###### 6
Flash forth [[H1299]] Your lightning [[H1300]] and scatter them; [[H6327]] shoot [[H7971]] Your arrows [[H2671]] and rout them. [[H2000]]

###### 7
Reach down [[H7971]] from on high; [[H4791]] rescue me [[H6475]] and deliver me [[H5337]] from deep [[H7227]] waters, [[H4325]] from the grasp [[H3027]] of foreigners, [[H1121]]

###### 8
whose [[H834]] mouths [[H6310]] speak [[H1696]] falsehood, [[H7723]] whose right hands [[H3225]] are deceitful. [[H8267]]

###### 9
I will sing [[H7891]] to You  a new [[H2319]] song, [[H7892]] O God; [[H430]] on a harp [[H5035]] of ten strings [[H6218]] I will make music [[H2167]] to You, 

###### 10
to the One who gives [[H5414]] victory [[H8668]] to kings, [[H4428]] who frees [[H6475]] His servant [[H5650]] David [[H1732]] from the deadly [[H7451]] sword. [[H2719]]

###### 11
Set me free [[H6475]] and rescue me [[H5337]] from the grasp [[H3027]] of foreigners, [[H1121]] whose [[H834]] mouths [[H6310]] speak [[H1696]] falsehood, [[H7723]] whose right hands [[H3225]] are deceitful. [[H8267]]

###### 12
Then [[H834]] our sons [[H1121]] will be like plants [[H5195]] nurtured [[H1431]] in their youth, [[H5271]] our daughters [[H1323]] like corner pillars [[H2106]] carved [[H2404]] to adorn [[H8403]] a palace. [[H1964]]

###### 13
Our storehouses [[H4200]] will be full, [[H4392]] supplying [[H6329]] all manner of [[H2177]] produce; [[H2177]] our flocks [[H6629]] will bring forth thousands, [[H503]] tens of thousands [[H7231]] in our fields. [[H2351]]

###### 14
Our oxen [[H441]] will bear great loads. [[H5445]] There will be no [[H369]] breach in the walls, [[H6556]] no [[H369]] going into captivity, [[H3318]] and no [[H369]] cry of lament [[H6682]] in our streets. [[H7339]]

###### 15
Blessed [[H835]] are the people [[H5971]] of whom this is so; [[H3602]] blessed [[H835]] are the people [[H5971]] whose God [[H430]] is the LORD. [[H3068]]
