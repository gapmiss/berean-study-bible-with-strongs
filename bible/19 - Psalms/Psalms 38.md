### 1
A Psalm [[H4210]] of David, [[H1732]] for remembrance. [[H2142]] O LORD, [[H3068]] do not [[H408]] rebuke me [[H3198]] in Your anger [[H7110]] or discipline me [[H3256]] in Your wrath. [[H2534]]

### 2
For [[H3588]] Your arrows [[H2671]] have pierced me deeply, [[H5181]] and Your hand [[H3027]] has pressed down [[H5181]] on me. [[H5921]]

### 3
There is no [[H369]] soundness [[H4974]] in my body [[H1320]] because of [[H6440]] Your anger; [[H2195]] there is no [[H369]] rest [[H7965]] in my bones [[H6106]] because of [[H6440]] my sin. [[H2403]]

### 4
For [[H3588]] my iniquities [[H5771]] have overwhelmed [[H5674]] me; [[H7218]] they are a burden [[H4853]] too heavy [[H3515]] to bear. [[H3513]]

### 5
My wounds [[H2250]] are foul [[H887]] and festering [[H4743]] because of [[H6440]] my sinful folly. [[H200]]

### 6
I am bent [[H5753]] and brought low; [[H7817]] all day long [[H3605]] I go about [[H1980]] mourning. [[H6937]]

### 7
For [[H3588]] my loins [[H3689]] are full of [[H4390]] burning pain, [[H7033]] and no [[H369]] soundness [[H4974]] [remains] in my body. [[H1320]]

### 8
I am numb [[H6313]] and badly [[H5704]] crushed; [[H1794]] I groan [[H7580]] in anguish [[H5100]] of heart. [[H3820]]

### 9
O Lord, [[H136]] my every [[H3605]] desire [[H8378]] [is] before You; [[H5048]] my groaning [[H585]] is not [[H3808]] hidden [[H5641]] from You. [[H4480]]

### 10
My heart [[H3820]] pounds, [[H5503]] my strength [[H3581]] fails, [[H5800]] and even [[H1571]] the light [[H216]] of my eyes [[H5869]] has faded. [[H369]]

### 11
My beloved [[H157]] and friends [[H7453]] shun [[H5975]] my disease, [[H5061]] and my kinsmen [[H7138]] stand [[H5975]] at a distance. [[H7350]]

### 12
Those who seek [[H1245]] my life [[H5315]] lay snares; [[H5367]] those who wish me [[H1875]] harm [[H7451]] speak [[H1696]] destruction, [[H1942]] and plot [[H1897]] deceit [[H4820]] all [[H3605]] day long. [[H3117]]

### 13
But I, [[H589]] like a deaf man, [[H2795]] do not [[H3808]] hear, [[H8085]] and like a mute man, [[H483]] I do not [[H3808]] open [[H6605]] my mouth. [[H6310]]

### 14
I have become [[H1961]] like a man [[H376]] who [[H834]] does not [[H3808]] hear, [[H8085]] whose mouth [[H6310]] offers no reply. [[H8433]]

### 15
I wait [[H3176]] for You,  O LORD; [[H3069]] You [[H859]] will answer, [[H6030]] O Lord [[H136]] my God. [[H430]]

### 16
For [[H3588]] I said, [[H559]] “Let them not [[H6435]] gloat [[H8055]] over me—  those who taunt [[H1431]] me [[H5921]] when my foot [[H7272]] slips.” [[H4131]]

### 17
For [[H3588]] I [[H589]] am ready [[H3559]] to fall, [[H6761]] and my pain [[H4341]] is ever [[H8548]] with me. [[H5048]]

### 18
Yes, [[H3588]] I confess [[H5046]] my iniquity; [[H5771]] I am troubled [[H1672]] by my sin. [[H2403]]

### 19
Many are my enemies [[H341]] without cause, [[H2416]] and many [[H7231]] hate me [[H8130]] without reason. [[H8267]]

### 20
Those who repay [[H7999]] my good [[H2896]] with [[H8478]] evil [[H7451]] attack [[H7853]] me for [[H8478]] pursuing [[H7291]] the good. 

### 21
Do not [[H408]] forsake me, [[H5800]] O LORD; [[H3068]] be not [[H408]] far [[H7368]] from me, [[H4480]] O my God. [[H430]]

### 22
Come quickly [[H2363]] to help me, [[H5833]] O Lord [[H136]] my Savior. [[H8668]]
