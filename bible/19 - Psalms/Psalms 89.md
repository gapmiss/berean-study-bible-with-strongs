### 1
A Maskil [[H4905]] of Ethan [[H387]] the Ezrahite. [[H250]] I will sing [[H7891]] of the LORD’s [[H3068]] loving devotion [[H2617]] forever; [[H5769]] with my mouth [[H6310]] I will proclaim [[H3045]] Your faithfulness [[H530]] to all [[H1755]] generations. [[H1755]]

### 2
For [[H3588]] I have said, [[H559]] “Loving devotion [[H2617]] is built up [[H1129]] forever; [[H5769]] in the heavens [[H8064]] You establish [[H3559]] Your faithfulness.” [[H530]]

### 3
You said, “I have made [[H3772]] a covenant [[H1285]] with My chosen one, [[H972]] I have sworn [[H7650]] to David [[H1732]] My servant: [[H5650]]

### 4
‘I will establish [[H3559]] your offspring [[H2233]] forever [[H5704]] and build up [[H1129]] your throne [[H3678]] for all generations.’” [[H1755]] Selah [[H5542]]

### 5
The heavens [[H8064]] praise [[H3034]] Your wonders, [[H6382]] O LORD— [[H3068]] Your faithfulness [[H530]] as well— [[H637]] in the assembly [[H6951]] of the holy ones. [[H6918]]

### 6
For [[H3588]] who [[H4310]] in the skies [[H7834]] can compare [[H6186]] with the LORD? [[H3068]] Who among the heavenly beings [[H1121]] is like [[H1819]] the LORD? [[H3068]]

### 7
In the council [[H5475]] of the holy ones, [[H6918]] God [[H410]] is greatly [[H7227]] feared, [[H6206]] and awesome [[H3372]] above [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] who surround Him. [[H5439]]

### 8
O LORD [[H3068]] God [[H430]] of Hosts, [[H6635]] who [[H4310]] is like You? [[H3644]] O mighty [[H2626]] LORD, [[H3050]] Your faithfulness [[H530]] surrounds You. [[H5439]]

### 9
You [[H859]] rule [[H4910]] the raging [[H1348]] sea; [[H3220]] when its waves [[H1530]] mount up, [[H7721]] You [[H859]] still them. [[H7623]]

### 10
You [[H859]] crushed [[H1792]] Rahab [[H7294]] like a carcass; [[H2491]] You scattered [[H6340]] Your enemies [[H341]] with Your mighty [[H5797]] arm. [[H2220]]

### 11
The heavens are Yours, [[H8064]] and also [[H637]] the earth. [[H776]] The world [[H8398]] and its fullness [[H4393]] You [[H859]] founded. [[H3245]]

### 12
North [[H6828]] and south [[H3225]] You [[H859]] created; [[H1254]] Tabor [[H8396]] and Hermon [[H2768]] shout for joy [[H7442]] at Your name. [[H8034]]

### 13
Mighty [[H1369]] is Your [[H5973]] arm, [[H2220]] strong is [[H5810]] Your hand; [[H3027]] Your right hand [[H3225]] is exalted. [[H7311]]

### 14
Righteousness [[H6664]] and justice [[H4941]] are the foundation [[H4349]] of Your throne; [[H3678]] loving devotion [[H2617]] and truth [[H571]] go [[H6923]] before You. [[H6440]]

### 15
Blessed [[H835]] are those [[H5971]] who know [[H3045]] the joyful sound, [[H8643]] who walk, [[H1980]] O LORD, [[H3068]] in the light [[H216]] of Your presence. [[H6440]]

### 16
They rejoice [[H1523]] in Your name [[H8034]] all day long, [[H3605]] and in Your righteousness [[H6666]] they exult. [[H7311]]

### 17
For [[H3588]] You [[H859]] [are] the glory [[H8597]] of their strength, [[H5797]] and by Your favor [[H7522]] our horn [[H7161]] is exalted. [[H7311]]

### 18
Surely [[H3588]] our shield [[H4043]] belongs to the LORD, [[H3068]] and our king [[H4428]] to the Holy [[H6918]] One of Israel. [[H3478]]

### 19
You once [[H227]] spoke [[H1696]] in a vision, [[H2377]] to Your godly ones [[H2623]] You said, [[H559]] “I have bestowed [[H7737]] help [[H5828]] on [[H5921]] a warrior; [[H1368]] I have exalted [[H7311]] one chosen [[H970]] from the people. [[H5971]]

### 20
I have found [[H4672]] David [[H1732]] My servant; [[H5650]] with My sacred [[H6944]] oil [[H8081]] I have anointed him. [[H4886]]

### 21
My hand [[H3027]] will sustain him; [[H3559]] surely [[H637]] My arm [[H2220]] will strengthen him. [[H553]]

### 22
No [[H3808]] enemy [[H341]] will exact tribute; [[H5378]] no [[H3808]] wicked [[H5766]] man [[H1121]] will oppress him. [[H6031]]

### 23
I will crush [[H3807]] his foes [[H6862]] before him [[H6440]] and strike down [[H5062]] those who hate him. [[H8130]]

### 24
My faithfulness [[H530]] and loving devotion [[H2617]] will be with him, [[H5973]] and through My name [[H8034]] his horn [[H7161]] will be exalted. [[H7311]]

### 25
I will set [[H7760]] his hand [[H3027]] over the sea, [[H3220]] and his right hand [[H3225]] upon the rivers. [[H5104]]

### 26
He [[H1931]] will call to Me, [[H7121]] ‘You [[H859]] are my Father, [[H1]] my God, [[H410]] the rock [[H6697]] of my salvation.’ [[H3444]]

### 27
I [[H589]] will indeed [[H637]] appoint him as [[H5414]] My firstborn, [[H1060]] the highest [[H5945]] of the kings [[H4428]] of the earth. [[H776]]

### 28
I will forever [[H5769]] preserve [[H8104]] My loving devotion for him, [[H2617]] and My covenant [[H1285]] with him  will stand fast. [[H539]]

### 29
I will establish [[H7760]] his line forever, [[H2233]] his throne [[H3678]] as long as [[H3117]] the heavens endure. [[H8064]]

### 30
If [[H518]] his sons [[H1121]] forsake [[H5800]] My law [[H8451]] and do not [[H3808]] walk [[H1980]] in My judgments, [[H4941]]

### 31
if [[H518]] they violate [[H2490]] My statutes [[H2708]] and fail [[H3808]] to keep [[H8104]] My commandments, [[H4687]]

### 32
I will attend to [[H6485]] their transgression [[H6588]] with the rod, [[H7626]] and to their iniquity [[H5771]] with stripes. [[H5061]]

### 33
But I will not [[H3808]] withdraw [[H6331]] My loving devotion [[H2617]] from him, [[H5973]] nor ever [[H3808]] betray [[H8266]] My faithfulness. [[H530]]

### 34
I will not [[H3808]] violate [[H2490]] My covenant [[H1285]] or [[H3808]] alter [[H8138]] the utterance [[H4161]] of My lips. [[H8193]]

### 35
Once and for all [[H259]] I have sworn [[H7650]] by My holiness— [[H6944]] I will not [[H518]] lie [[H3576]] to David— [[H1732]]

### 36
his offspring [[H2233]] will endure [[H1961]] forever, [[H5769]] and his throne [[H3678]] will be like the sun [[H8121]] before Me, [[H5048]]

### 37
like the moon, [[H3394]] established [[H3559]] forever, [[H5769]] a faithful [[H539]] witness [[H5707]] in the sky.” [[H7834]] Selah [[H5542]]

### 38
But You [[H859]] have spurned [[H2186]] and rejected him; [[H3988]] You are enraged [[H5674]] by [[H5973]] Your anointed one. [[H4899]]

### 39
You have renounced [[H5010]] the covenant [[H1285]] with Your servant [[H5650]] and sullied [[H2490]] his crown [[H5145]] in the dust. [[H776]]

### 40
You have broken down [[H6555]] all [[H3605]] his walls; [[H1448]] You have reduced [[H7760]] his strongholds [[H4013]] to rubble. [[H4288]]

### 41
All [[H3605]] who pass by [[H5674]] plunder him; [[H8155]] he has become [[H1961]] a reproach [[H2781]] to his neighbors. [[H7934]]

### 42
You have exalted [[H7311]] the right hand [[H3225]] of his foes; [[H6862]] You have made all [[H3605]] his enemies [[H341]] rejoice. [[H8055]]

### 43
You have [[H637]] bent [[H7725]] the edge [[H6697]] of his sword [[H2719]] and have not [[H3808]] sustained him [[H6965]] in battle. [[H4421]]

### 44
You have ended [[H7673]] his splendor [[H2892]] and cast [[H4048]] his throne [[H3678]] to the ground. [[H776]]

### 45
You have shortened [[H7114]] the days [[H3117]] of his youth; [[H5934]] You have covered [[H5844]] him [[H5921]] with shame. [[H955]] Selah [[H5542]]

### 46
How long, [[H5704]] O LORD? [[H3068]] Will You hide Yourself [[H5641]] forever? [[H5331]] Will Your wrath [[H2534]] keep burning [[H1197]] like [[H3644]] fire? [[H784]]

### 47
Remember [[H2142]] how [[H4100]] short [[H2465]] is my lifespan. [[H589]] For [[H5921]] what [[H4100]] futility [[H7723]] You have created [[H1254]] all [[H3605]] men! [[H120]]

### 48
What [[H4310]] man [[H1397]] can live [[H2421]] and never [[H3808]] see [[H7200]] death? [[H4194]] Can he deliver [[H4422]] his soul [[H5315]] from the power [[H3027]] of Sheol? [[H7585]] Selah [[H5542]]

### 49
Where, [[H346]] O Lord, [[H136]] [is] Your loving devotion [[H2617]] of old, [[H7223]] which You swore [[H7650]] steadfastly [[H530]] to David? [[H1732]]

### 50
Remember, [[H2142]] O Lord, [[H136]] the reproach [[H2781]] of Your servants, [[H5650]] which I bear [[H5375]] in my heart [[H2436]] from so [[H3605]] many [[H7227]] people, [[H5971]]

### 51
how [[H834]] Your enemies [[H341]] have taunted, [[H2778]] O LORD, [[H3068]] how [[H834]] they have mocked [[H2778]] every step [[H6119]] of Your anointed one. [[H4899]]

### 52
Blessed be [[H1288]] the LORD [[H3068]] forever! [[H5769]] Amen [[H543]] and amen. [[H543]]
