### 1
For the choirmaster. [[H5329]] To the tune of [[H413]] “The Lilies of the Covenant.” [[H7802]] A Psalm [[H4210]] of Asaph. [[H623]] Hear us, [[H238]] O Shepherd [[H7462]] of Israel, [[H3478]] who leads [[H5090]] Joseph [[H3130]] like a flock; [[H6629]] You who sit enthroned [[H3427]] [between] the cherubim, [[H3742]] shine forth. [[H3313]]

### 2
Before [[H6440]] Ephraim, [[H669]] Benjamin, [[H1144]] and Manasseh, [[H4519]] rally [[H5782]] Your power [[H1369]] and come [[H1980]] to save [[H3444]] us. 

### 3
Restore us, [[H7725]] O God, [[H430]] and cause Your face [[H6440]] to shine upon us, [[H215]] that we may be saved. [[H3467]]

### 4
O LORD [[H3068]] God [[H430]] of Hosts, [[H6635]] how long [[H5704]] will Your anger smolder [[H6225]] against the prayers [[H8605]] of Your people? [[H5971]]

### 5
You fed them [[H398]] with the bread [[H3899]] of tears [[H1832]] and made them drink [[H8248]] their full measure [[H7991]] of tears. [[H1832]]

### 6
You make us [[H7760]] contend [[H4066]] with our neighbors; [[H7934]] our enemies [[H341]] mock [[H3932]] us. 

### 7
Restore us, [[H7725]] O God [[H430]] of Hosts, [[H6635]] and cause Your face [[H6440]] to shine upon us, [[H215]] that we may be saved. [[H3467]]

### 8
You uprooted [[H5265]] a vine [[H1612]] from Egypt; [[H4714]] You drove out [[H1644]] the nations [[H1471]] and transplanted it. [[H5193]]

### 9
You cleared the ground [[H6437]] for it, [[H6440]] and it took [[H8327]] root [[H8328]] and filled [[H4390]] the land. [[H776]]

### 10
The mountains [[H2022]] were covered [[H3680]] by its shade, [[H6738]] and the mighty [[H410]] cedars [[H730]] with its branches. [[H6057]]

### 11
It sent out [[H7971]] its branches [[H7105]] to [[H5704]] the Sea, [[H3220]] and its shoots [[H3127]] toward [[H413]] the River. [[H5104]]

### 12
Why [[H4100]] have You broken down [[H6555]] its walls, [[H1447]] so that all [[H3605]] who pass by [[H5674]] pick its fruit? [[H717]]

### 13
The boar [[H2386]] from the forest [[H3293]] ravages it, [[H3765]] and the creatures [[H2123]] of the field [[H7704]] feed upon it. [[H7462]]

### 14
Return, [[H7725]] O God [[H430]] of Hosts, [[H6635]] we pray! [[H4994]] Look down [[H5027]] from heaven [[H8064]] and see! [[H7200]] Attend to [[H6485]] this [[H2063]] vine, [[H1612]]

### 15
the root [[H3657]] Your right hand [[H3225]] has planted, [[H5193]] the branch [[H1121]] You have raised up [[H553]] for Yourself. 

### 16
[Your vine] has been cut down [[H3683]] and burned; [[H8313]] they perish [[H6]] at the rebuke [[H1606]] of Your countenance. [[H6440]]

### 17
Let Your hand [[H3027]] be [[H1961]] upon [[H5921]] the man [[H376]] at Your right hand, [[H3225]] on [[H5921]] the son [[H1121]] of man [[H120]] You have raised up [[H553]] for Yourself. 

### 18
Then we will not [[H3808]] turn away [[H5472]] from You; [[H4480]] revive us, [[H2421]] and we will call [[H7121]] on Your name. [[H8034]]

### 19
Restore us, [[H7725]] O LORD [[H3068]] God [[H430]] of Hosts; [[H6635]] cause Your face [[H6440]] to shine upon us, [[H215]] that we may be saved. [[H3467]]
