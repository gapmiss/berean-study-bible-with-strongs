### 1
A Song [[H7892]] of Ascents. [[H4609]] Of David. [[H1732]] If the LORD [[H3068]] had not [[H3884]] been on our side— [[H1961]] let Israel [[H3478]] now [[H4994]] declare— [[H559]]

### 2
if the LORD [[H3068]] had not [[H3884]] been on our side [[H1961]] when men [[H120]] attacked [[H6965]] us, [[H5921]]

### 3
when their anger [[H639]] flared [[H2734]] against us,  then [[H233]] they would have swallowed [[H1104]] us alive, [[H2416]]

### 4
then [[H233]] the floods [[H4325]] would have engulfed us, [[H7857]] the torrent [[H5158]] would have overwhelmed [[H5674]] us, [[H5315]]

### 5
then [[H233]] the raging [[H2121]] waters [[H4325]] would have swept us away. [[H5674]]

### 6
Blessed [[H1288]] [be] the LORD, [[H3068]] who has not [[H3808]] given us [[H5414]] as prey [[H2964]] to their teeth. [[H8127]]

### 7
We [[H5315]] have escaped [[H4422]] like a bird [[H6833]] from the snare [[H6341]] of the fowler; [[H3369]] the net [[H6341]] is torn, [[H7665]] and we [[H587]] have slipped away. [[H4422]]

### 8
Our help [[H5828]] is in the name [[H8034]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] the Maker [[H6213]] of heaven [[H8064]] and earth. [[H776]]
