Awake, [[H5782]] O harp [[H5035]] and lyre! [[H3658]] I will awaken [[H5782]] the dawn. [[H7837]]

Have You [[H3808]] rejected us, [[H2186]] O God? [[H430]] Do You no longer [[H3808]] march out, [[H3318]] O God, [[H430]] with our armies? [[H6635]]

Give [[H3051]] us  aid [[H5833]] against the foe, [[H6862]] for the help [[H8668]] of man [[H120]] is worthless. [[H7723]]

With God [[H430]] we perform [[H6213]] with valor, [[H2428]] and He [[H1931]] will trample [[H947]] our enemies. [[H6862]]
