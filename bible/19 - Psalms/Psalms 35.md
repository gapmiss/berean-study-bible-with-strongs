### 1
Of David. [[H1732]] Contend [[H7378]] with my opponents, [[H3401]] O LORD; [[H3068]] fight against [[H3898]] those who battle me. [[H3898]]

### 2
Take up [[H2388]] Your shield [[H4043]] and buckler; [[H6793]] arise and come [[H6965]] to my aid. [[H5833]]

### 3
Draw [[H7324]] the spear [[H2595]] and javelin [[H5462]] against [[H7125]] my pursuers; [[H7291]] say [[H559]] to my soul: [[H5315]] “I [am] [[H589]] your salvation.” [[H3444]]

### 4
May those who seek [[H1245]] my life [[H5315]] be disgraced [[H954]] and put to shame; [[H3637]] may those who plan [[H2803]] to harm me [[H7451]] be driven back [[H5472]] and confounded. [[H2659]]

### 5
May they be [[H1961]] like chaff [[H4671]] in [[H6440]] the wind, [[H7307]] as the angel [[H4397]] of the LORD [[H3068]] drives them away. [[H1760]]

### 6
May their path [[H1870]] be [[H1961]] dark [[H2822]] and slick, [[H2519]] as the angel [[H4397]] of the LORD [[H3068]] pursues. [[H7291]]

### 7
For [[H3588]] without cause [[H2600]] they laid [[H2934]] their net [[H7568]] for me;  without reason [[H2600]] they dug [[H2658]] a pit [[H7845]] for my soul. [[H5315]]

### 8
May ruin [[H7722]] befall them [[H935]] by surprise; [[H3808]] may the net [[H7568]] they hid [[H2934]] ensnare them; [[H3920]] may they fall [[H5307]] into  their own destruction. [[H7722]]

### 9
Then my soul [[H5315]] will rejoice [[H1523]] in the LORD [[H3068]] and exult [[H7797]] in His salvation. [[H3444]]

### 10
All [[H3605]] my bones [[H6106]] will exclaim, [[H559]] “Who [[H4310]] is like You, [[H3644]] O LORD, [[H3068]] who delivers [[H5337]] the afflicted [[H6041]] from [[H4480]] the aggressor, [[H2389]] the poor [[H6041]] and needy [[H34]] from the robber?” [[H1497]]

### 11
Hostile [[H2555]] witnesses [[H5707]] come forward; [[H6965]] they make charges [[H7592]] I know [[H3045]] nothing {about}. [[H3808]]

### 12
They repay [[H7999]] me evil [[H7451]] for [[H8478]] good, [[H2896]] [to] the bereavement [[H7908]] of my soul. [[H5315]]

### 13
Yet [[H589]] during their illness, [[H2470]] I put on [[H3830]] sackcloth; [[H8242]] I humbled [[H6031]] myself [[H5315]] with fasting, [[H6685]] but my prayers [[H8605]] returned unanswered. [[H5921]]

### 14
I paced about [[H1980]] as for my friend [[H7453]] or brother; [[H251]] I was bowed down [[H7817]] with grief, [[H6937]] like one mourning [[H57]] [for his] mother. [[H517]]

### 15
But when I stumbled, [[H6761]] they assembled [[H622]] in glee; [[H8055]] they gathered together [[H622]] against me. [[H5921]] Assailants [[H5222]] I did not [[H3808]] know [[H3045]] slandered me [[H7167]] without [[H3808]] ceasing. [[H1826]]

### 16
Like godless [[H2611]] jesters [[H3934]] at a feast, [[H4580]] they gnashed [[H2786]] their teeth [[H8127]] at me. [[H5921]]

### 17
How long, [[H4100]] O Lord, [[H136]] will You look on? [[H7200]] Rescue [[H7725]] my soul [[H5315]] from their ravages, [[H7722]] my precious life [[H3173]] from these lions. [[H3715]]

### 18
Then I will give You thanks [[H3034]] in the great [[H7227]] assembly; [[H6951]] I will praise You [[H1984]] among many [[H6099]] people. [[H5971]]

### 19
Let not [[H408]] my enemies [[H341]] gloat over me [[H8055]] without cause, [[H8267]] or those who hate me [[H8130]] without reason [[H2600]] wink in malice. [[H7169]]

### 20
For [[H3588]] they do not [[H3808]] speak [[H1696]] peace, [[H7965]] but devise [[H2803]] deceitful [[H4820]] schemes [[H1697]] against [[H5921]] those who live quietly [[H7282]] in the land. [[H776]]

### 21
They gape [[H6310]] at me [[H5921]] and say, [[H559]] “Aha, [[H1889]] aha! [[H1889]] Our eyes [[H5869]] have seen!” [[H7200]]

### 22
O LORD, [[H3068]] You have seen it, [[H7200]] do not [[H408]] be silent. [[H2790]] O Lord, [[H136]] be not [[H408]] far [[H7368]] from me. [[H4480]]

### 23
Awake [[H5782]] and rise [[H6974]] to my defense, [[H4941]] to my cause, [[H7379]] my God [[H430]] and my Lord! [[H136]]

### 24
Vindicate me [[H8199]] by Your righteousness, [[H6664]] O LORD [[H3068]] my God, [[H430]] and do not let them [[H408]] gloat [[H8055]] over me. 

### 25
Let them not [[H408]] say [[H559]] in their hearts, [[H3820]] “Aha, [[H1889]] just what we wanted!” [[H5315]] Let them not [[H408]] say, [[H559]] “We have swallowed him up!” [[H1104]]

### 26
May those who gloat [[H8056]] in my distress [[H7451]] be ashamed [[H954]] and confounded; [[H2659]] may those who exalt themselves [[H1431]] over me [[H5921]] be clothed [[H3847]] in shame [[H1322]] and reproach. [[H3639]]

### 27
May those who favor [[H2655]] my vindication [[H6664]] shout for joy [[H7442]] and gladness; [[H8055]] may they always [[H8548]] say, [[H559]] “Exalted be [[H1431]] the LORD [[H3068]] who delights [[H2655]] in His servant’s [[H5650]] well-being.” [[H7965]]

### 28
Then my tongue [[H3956]] will proclaim [[H1897]] Your righteousness [[H6664]] [and] Your praises [[H8416]] all [[H3605]] day long. [[H3117]]
