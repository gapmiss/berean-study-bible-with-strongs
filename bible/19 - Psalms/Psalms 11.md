### 1
For the choirmaster. [[H5329]] Of David. [[H1732]] In the LORD [[H3068]] I take refuge. [[H2620]] So how [[H349]] can you say [[H559]] to me, [[H5315]] “Flee [[H5110]] to your mountain [[H2022]] like a bird! [[H6833]]

### 2
For [[H3588]] behold, [[H2009]] the wicked [[H7563]] bend [[H1869]] [their] bows; [[H7198]] they set [[H3559]] their arrow [[H2671]] on [[H5921]] the string [[H3499]] to shoot [[H3384]] from [[H1119]] the shadows [[H652]] at the upright [[H3477]] in heart. [[H3820]]

### 3
If [[H3588]] the foundations [[H8356]] are destroyed, [[H2040]] what [[H4100]] can the righteous [[H6662]] do?” [[H6466]]

### 4
The LORD [[H3068]] is in His holy [[H6944]] temple; [[H1964]] the LORD [[H3068]] is on His heavenly [[H8064]] throne. [[H3678]] His eyes [[H5869]] are watching closely; [[H2372]] [they] [[H6079]] examine [[H974]] the sons [[H1121]] of men. [[H120]]

### 5
The LORD [[H3068]] tests [[H974]] the righteous [[H6662]] and the wicked; [[H7563]] His soul [[H5315]] hates [[H8130]] the lover [[H157]] of violence. [[H2555]]

### 6
On [[H5921]] the wicked [[H7563]] He will rain [[H4305]] fiery [[H784]] coals [[H6341]] and brimstone; [[H1614]] a scorching [[H2152]] wind [[H7307]] will be their portion. [[H4521]]

### 7
For [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] is righteous; [[H6662]] He loves [[H157]] justice. [[H6666]] The upright [[H3477]] will see [[H2372]] His face. [[H6440]]
