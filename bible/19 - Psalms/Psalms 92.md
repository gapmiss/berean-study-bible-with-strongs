### 1
A Psalm. [[H4210]] A Song [[H7892]] for the Sabbath [[H7676]] day. [[H3117]] It is good [[H2896]] to praise [[H3034]] the LORD, [[H3068]] and to sing praises [[H2167]] to Your name, [[H8034]] O Most High, [[H5945]]

### 2
to proclaim [[H5046]] Your loving devotion [[H2617]] in the morning, [[H1242]] and Your faithfulness [[H530]] at night, [[H3915]]

### 3
with [[H5921]] the ten-stringed [[H6218]] harp [[H5035]] and the melody [[H1902]] of the lyre. [[H3658]]

### 4
For [[H3588]] You, O LORD, [[H3068]] have made me glad [[H8055]] by Your deeds; [[H6467]] I will sing for joy [[H7442]] at the works [[H4639]] of Your hands. [[H3027]]

### 5
How [[H4100]] great [[H1431]] are Your works, [[H4639]] O LORD, [[H3068]] how [[H3966]] deep [[H6009]] are Your thoughts! [[H4284]]

### 6
A senseless [[H1198]] man [[H376]] does not [[H3808]] know, [[H3045]] and a fool [[H3684]] does not [[H3808]] understand, [[H995]]

### 7
that though the wicked [[H7563]] sprout [[H6524]] like [[H3644]] grass, [[H6212]] and all [[H3605]] evildoers [[H6466]] flourish, [[H6692]] they will be [[H5704]] forever [[H5703]] destroyed. [[H8045]]

### 8
But You, [[H859]] O LORD, [[H3068]] are exalted forever. [[H4791]]

### 9
For [[H3588]] surely [[H2009]] Your enemies, [[H341]] O LORD, [[H3068]] surely [[H2009]] Your enemies [[H341]] will perish; [[H6]] all [[H3605]] evildoers [[H6466]] will be scattered. [[H6504]]

### 10
But You have exalted [[H7311]] my horn [[H7161]] like that of a wild ox; [[H7214]] with fine [[H7488]] oil [[H8081]] I have been anointed. [[H1101]]

### 11
My eyes [[H5869]] see the downfall [[H5027]] of my enemies; [[H7790]] when evildoers [[H7489]] attack [[H6965]] me, [[H5921]] my ears [[H241]] are open. [[H8085]]

### 12
The righteous [[H6662]] will flourish [[H6524]] like a palm tree, [[H8558]] and grow [[H7685]] like a cedar [[H730]] in Lebanon. [[H3844]]

### 13
Planted [[H8362]] in the house [[H1004]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] they will flourish [[H6524]] in the courts [[H2691]] of our God. [[H430]]

### 14
In old age [[H7872]] they will still [[H5750]] bear fruit; [[H5107]] healthy [[H1879]] and green [[H7488]] they will remain, [[H1961]]

### 15
to proclaim, [[H5046]] “The LORD [[H3068]] [is] upright; [[H3477]] He is my rock, [[H6697]] and in Him  there is no [[H3808]] unrighteousness.” [[H5766]]
