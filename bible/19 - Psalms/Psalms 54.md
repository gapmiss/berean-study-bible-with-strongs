###### 1
For the choirmaster. [[H5329]] With stringed instruments. [[H5058]] A Maskil [[H4905]] of David. [[H1732]] When the Ziphites [[H2130]] went [[H935]] to Saul [[H7586]] and said, [[H559]] “Is David [[H1732]] not [[H3808]] hiding [[H5641]] among us?” [[H5973]] Save me, [[H3467]] O God, [[H430]] by Your name, [[H8034]] and vindicate me [[H1777]] by Your might! [[H1369]]

###### 2
Hear [[H8085]] my prayer, [[H8605]] O God; [[H430]] listen [[H238]] to the words [[H561]] of my mouth. [[H6310]]

###### 3
For [[H3588]] strangers [[H2114]] rise up [[H6965]] against me, [[H5921]] and ruthless [[H6184]] men seek [[H1245]] my life— [[H5315]] men with no [[H3808]] regard [[H7760]] for God. [[H430]] Selah [[H5542]]

###### 4
Surely [[H2009]] God [[H430]] is my helper; [[H5826]] the Lord [[H136]] is the sustainer [[H5564]] of my soul. [[H5315]]

###### 5
He will reward [[H7725]] my enemies [[H8324]] with evil. [[H7451]] In Your faithfulness, [[H571]] destroy them. [[H6789]]

###### 6
Freely [[H5071]] I will sacrifice [[H2076]] to You;  I will praise [[H3034]] Your name, [[H8034]] O LORD, [[H3068]] for [[H3588]] it is good. [[H2896]]

###### 7
For [[H3588]] He has delivered me [[H5337]] from every [[H3605]] trouble, [[H6869]] and my eyes [[H5869]] have stared down [[H7200]] my foes. [[H341]]
