For the choirmaster. [[H5329]] According to [[H5921]] Gittith. [[H1665]] A Psalm [[H4210]] of David. [[H1732]] O LORD, [[H3068]] our Lord, [[H113]] how [[H4100]] majestic [[H117]] is Your name [[H8034]] in all [[H3605]] the earth! [[H776]] You [[H834]] have set [[H5414]] Your glory [[H1935]] above [[H5921]] the heavens. [[H8064]]

###### 2
From the lips [[H6310]] of children [[H5768]] and infants [[H3243]] You have ordained [[H3245]] praise [[H5797]] on account of [[H4616]] Your adversaries, [[H6887]] to silence [[H7673]] the enemy [[H341]] and avenger. [[H5358]]

###### 3
When [[H3588]] I behold [[H7200]] Your heavens, [[H8064]] the work [[H4639]] of Your fingers, [[H676]] the moon [[H3394]] and the stars, [[H3556]] which [[H834]] You set in place— [[H3559]]

###### 4
what [[H4100]] is man [[H582]] that [[H3588]] You are mindful [of him], [[H2142]] or the son [[H1121]] of man [[H120]] that [[H3588]] You care for him? [[H6485]]

###### 5
You made him a little [[H2637]] lower [[H4592]] than the angels; [[H430]] you crowned him [[H5849]] with glory [[H3519]] and honor. [[H1926]]

###### 6
You made him ruler [[H4910]] of the works [[H4639]] of Your hands; [[H3027]] You have placed [[H7896]] everything [[H3605]] under [[H8478]] his feet: [[H7272]]

###### 7
all [[H3605]] sheep [[H6792]] and oxen, [[H504]] and even [[H1571]] the beasts [[H929]] of the field, [[H7704]]

###### 8
the birds [[H6833]] of the air, [[H8064]] and the fish [[H1709]] of the sea, [[H3220]] all that swim [[H5674]] the paths [[H734]] of the seas. [[H3220]]

###### 9
O LORD, [[H3068]] our Lord, [[H113]] how [[H4100]] majestic [[H117]] is Your name [[H8034]] in all [[H3605]] the earth! [[H776]]
