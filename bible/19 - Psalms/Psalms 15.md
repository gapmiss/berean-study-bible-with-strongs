###### 1
A Psalm [[H4210]] of David. [[H1732]] O LORD, [[H3068]] who [[H4310]] may abide [[H1481]] in Your tent? [[H168]] Who [[H4310]] may dwell [[H7931]] on Your holy [[H6944]] hill? [[H2022]]

###### 2
He who walks [[H1980]] with integrity [[H8549]] and practices [[H6466]] righteousness, [[H6664]] who speaks [[H1696]] the truth [[H571]] from his heart, [[H3824]]

###### 3
who has no [[H3808]] slander [[H7270]] on [[H5921]] his tongue, [[H3956]] who does [[H6213]] no [[H3808]] harm [[H7451]] to his neighbor, [[H7453]] who casts no scorn [[H2781]] on [[H5921]] his friend, [[H7138]]

###### 4
who despises [[H959]] the vile [[H3988]] but [[H853]] honors [[H3513]] those who fear [[H3373]] the LORD, [[H3068]] who does not [[H3808]] revise [[H4171]] a costly [[H7489]] oath, [[H7650]]

###### 5
who lends [[H5414]] his money [[H3701]] without [[H3808]] interest [[H5392]] and refuses [[H3947]] a bribe [[H7810]] against [[H5921]] the innocent. [[H5355]] He who does [[H6213]] these things [[H428]] will never [[H3808]] be shaken. [[H4131]]
