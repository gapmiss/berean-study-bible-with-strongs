[[Psalms 57|←]] • [[Psalms 59|→]]

### 1
For the choirmaster. [[H5329]] To the tune of  “Do Not Destroy.” [[H516]] A Miktam [[H4387]] of David. [[H1732]] Do you indeed [[H552]] speak [[H1696]] justly, [[H6664]] O rulers? [[H482]] Do you judge [[H8199]] uprightly, [[H4339]] O sons [[H1121]] of men? [[H120]]

### 2
No, [[H637]] in your hearts [[H3820]] you devise [[H6466]] injustice; [[H5766]] with your hands [[H3027]] you mete out [[H6424]] violence [[H2555]] on the earth. [[H776]]

### 3
The wicked [[H7563]] are estranged [[H2114]] from the womb; [[H7358]] the liars [[H1696]] go astray [[H8582]] from birth. [[H990]]

### 4
Their venom [[H2534]] [is] like [[H1823]] the poison [[H2534]] of a serpent, [[H5175]] like [[H3644]] a cobra [[H6620]] that shuts [[H2795]] its ears, [[H241]]

### 5
that [[H834]] it need not [[H3808]] heed [[H8085]] the tune [[H6963]] of the charmer [[H3907]] who skillfully [[H2449]] weaves his spell. [[H2266]]

### 6
O God, [[H430]] shatter [[H2040]] their teeth [[H8127]] in their mouths; [[H6310]] O LORD, [[H3068]] tear out [[H5422]] the fangs [[H4459]] of the lions. [[H3715]]

### 7
May they vanish [[H3988]] like [[H3644]] water [[H4325]] that runs off; [[H1980]] when they draw the bow, [[H1869]] may their arrows [[H2671]] be blunted. [[H4135]]

### 8
Like [[H3644]] a slug [[H7642]] that dissolves [[H1980]] in its slime, [[H8557]] like a woman’s [[H802]] stillborn child, [[H5309]] may they never [[H1077]] see [[H2372]] the sun. [[H8121]]

### 9
Before [[H2962]] your pots [[H5518]] can feel [[H995]] [the heat of] thorns— [[H329]] whether green [[H2416]] or [[H3644]] dry— [[H2740]] He will sweep them away. [[H8175]]

### 10
The righteous [[H6662]] will rejoice [[H8055]] when [[H3588]] they see [[H2372]] they are avenged; [[H5359]] they will wash [[H7364]] their feet [[H6471]] in the blood [[H1818]] of the wicked. [[H7563]]

### 11
Then men [[H120]] will say, [[H559]] “There is surely [[H389]] a reward [[H6529]] for the righteous! [[H6662]] There is [[H3426]] surely [[H389]] a God [[H430]] who judges [[H8199]] the earth!” [[H776]]
