[[Psalms 41|←]] • [[Psalms 43|→]]

### 1
For the choirmaster. [[H5329]] A Maskil [[H4905]] of the sons [[H1121]] of Korah. [[H7141]] As the deer [[H354]] pants [[H6165]] for [[H5921]] streams [[H650]] of water, [[H4325]] so [[H3651]] my soul [[H5315]] longs [[H6165]] after You, [[H413]] O God. [[H430]]

### 2
My soul [[H5315]] thirsts [[H6770]] for God, [[H430]] the living [[H2416]] God. [[H410]] When [[H4970]] shall I come [[H935]] and appear [[H7200]] in [[H6440]] God’s presence? [[H430]]

### 3
My tears [[H1832]] have been [[H1961]] my  food [[H3899]] day [[H3119]] and night, [[H3915]] while men say [[H559]] to me [[H413]] all day long, [[H3605]] “Where [[H346]] is your God?” [[H430]]

### 4
These things [[H428]] come to mind [[H2142]] as I pour out [[H8210]] my soul: [[H5315]] how [[H3588]] I walked [[H5674]] with the multitude, [[H5519]] leading [[H1718]] the procession [[H2287]] to [[H5704]] the house [[H1004]] of God, [[H430]] with shouts [[H6963]] of joy [[H7440]] and praise. [[H8426]]

### 5
Why [[H4100]] are you downcast, [[H7817]] O my soul? [[H5315]] Why the unease [[H1993]] within me? [[H5921]] Put your hope [[H3176]] in God, [[H430]] for [[H3588]] I shall yet [[H5750]] praise Him [[H3034]] for the salvation [[H3444]] of His presence. [[H6440]]

### 6
O my God, [[H430]] my soul [[H5315]] despairs [[H7817]] within me. [[H5921]] Therefore [[H5921]] I remember You [[H2142]] from the land [[H776]] of Jordan [[H3383]] and the peaks of Hermon— [[H2769]] from Mount [[H2022]] Mizar. [[H4706]]

### 7
Deep [[H8415]] calls [[H7121]] to [[H413]] deep [[H8415]] in the roar [[H6963]] of Your waterfalls; [[H6794]] all [[H3605]] Your breakers [[H4867]] and waves [[H1530]] have rolled [[H5674]] over me. [[H5921]]

### 8
The LORD [[H3068]] decrees [[H6680]] His loving devotion [[H2617]] by day; [[H3119]] and at night [[H3915]] His song [[H7892]] is with me— [[H5973]] a prayer [[H8605]] to the God [[H410]] of my life. [[H2416]]

### 9
I will say [[H559]] to God, [[H410]] my rock, [[H5553]] “Why [[H4100]] have You forgotten me? [[H7911]] Why [[H4100]] must I walk [[H1980]] in sorrow [[H6937]] because of the enemy’s [[H341]] oppression?” [[H3906]]

### 10
Like the crushing [[H7524]] of my bones, [[H6106]] my enemies [[H6887]] taunt me, [[H2778]] while they say [[H559]] to me [[H413]] all [[H3605]] day long, [[H3117]] “Where [[H346]] is your God?” [[H430]]

### 11
Why [[H4100]] are you downcast, [[H7817]] O my soul? [[H5315]] Why [[H4100]] the unease [[H1993]] within me? [[H5921]] Put your hope [[H3176]] in God, [[H430]] for [[H3588]] I shall yet [[H5750]] praise Him, [[H3034]] my Savior [[H3444]] and my God. [[H430]]
