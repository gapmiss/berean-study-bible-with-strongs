### 1
For the choirmaster. [[H5329]] With stringed instruments. [[H5058]] A Psalm [[H4210]] of David. [[H1732]] Answer [[H6030]] me when I call, [[H7121]] O God [[H430]] of my righteousness! [[H6664]] You have relieved [[H7337]] my distress; [[H6862]] show me grace [[H2603]] and hear [[H8085]] my prayer. [[H8605]]

### 2
How long, [[H5704]] O men, [[H1121]] will my honor [[H3519]] be maligned? [[H3639]] How long will you love [[H157]] vanity [[H7385]] and seek after [[H1245]] lies? [[H3577]] Selah [[H5542]]

### 3
Know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] has set apart [[H6395]] the godly [[H2623]] for Himself;  the LORD [[H3068]] will hear [[H8085]] when I call [[H7121]] to Him. [[H413]]

### 4
Be angry, [[H7264]] yet do not [[H408]] sin; [[H2398]] on [[H5921]] your bed, [[H4904]] search [[H559]] your heart [[H3824]] and be still. [[H1826]] Selah [[H5542]]

### 5
Offer [[H2076]] the sacrifices [[H2077]] of righteousness [[H6664]] and trust [[H982]] in [[H413]] the LORD. [[H3068]]

### 6
Many [[H7227]] ask, [[H559]] “Who [[H4310]] can show us [[H7200]] the good?” [[H2896]] Shine [[H5375]] the light [[H216]] of Your face [[H6440]] upon us, [[H5921]] O LORD. [[H3068]]

### 7
You have filled [[H5414]] my heart [[H3820]] with more joy [[H8057]] than when [[H6256]] grain [[H1715]] and new wine [[H8492]] abound. [[H7231]]

### 8
I will [[H3162]] lie down [[H7901]] and sleep [[H3462]] in peace, [[H7965]] for [[H3588]] You [[H859]] alone, [[H910]] O LORD, [[H3068]] make me dwell [[H3427]] in safety. [[H983]]
