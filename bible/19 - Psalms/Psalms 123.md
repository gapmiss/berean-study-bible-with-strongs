###### 1
A Song [[H7892]] of Ascents. [[H4609]] I lift up [[H5375]] my eyes [[H5869]] to You, [[H413]] the One enthroned [[H3427]] in heaven. [[H8064]]

###### 2
As the eyes [[H5869]] of servants [[H5650]] [look] to [[H413]] the hand [[H3027]] of their master, [[H113]] as the eyes [[H5869]] of a maidservant [[H8198]] [look] to [[H413]] the hand [[H3027]] of her mistress, [[H1404]] so [[H3651]] our eyes [[H5869]] are on [[H413]] the LORD [[H3068]] our God [[H430]] until [[H5704]] He shows us mercy. [[H2603]]

###### 3
Have mercy on us, [[H2603]] O LORD, [[H3068]] have mercy, [[H2603]] for [[H3588]] we have endured [[H7646]] much [[H7227]] contempt. [[H937]]

###### 4
We [[H5315]] have endured [[H7646]] much [[H7227]] scorn [[H3933]] from the arrogant, [[H7600]] much contempt [[H937]] from the proud. [[H1349]]
