### 1
A Psalm [[H4210]] of David, [[H1732]] when he fled [[H1272]] from [[H6440]] his son [[H1121]] Absalom. [[H53]] O LORD, [[H3068]] how [[H4100]] my foes [[H6862]] have increased! [[H7231]] How many [[H7227]] rise up [[H6965]] against me! [[H5921]]

### 2
Many [[H7227]] say [[H559]] of me, [[H5315]] “God [[H430]] will not [[H369]] deliver him.” [[H3444]] Selah [[H5542]]

### 3
But You, [[H859]] O LORD, [[H3068]] are a shield [[H4043]] around me, [[H1157]] my glory, [[H3519]] and the One who lifts [[H7311]] my head. [[H7218]]

### 4
To [[H413]] the LORD [[H3069]] I cry aloud, [[H7121]] and He answers [[H6030]] me from His holy [[H6944]] hill. [[H2022]] Selah [[H5542]]

### 5
I [[H589]] lie down [[H7901]] and sleep; [[H3462]] I wake again, [[H6974]] for [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] sustains me. [[H5564]]

### 6
I will not [[H3808]] fear [[H3372]] the myriads [[H7233]] set [[H7896]] against me [[H5921]] on every side. [[H5439]]

### 7
Arise, [[H6965]] O LORD! [[H3068]] Deliver me, [[H3467]] O my God! [[H430]] Strike [[H5221]] all [[H3605]] my enemies [[H341]] on the jaw; [[H3895]] break [[H7665]] the teeth [[H8127]] of the wicked. [[H7563]]

### 8
Salvation [[H3444]] belongs to the LORD; [[H3068]] may Your blessing [[H1293]] be on [[H5921]] Your people. [[H5971]] Selah [[H5542]]
