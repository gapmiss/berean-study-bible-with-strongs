[[Psalms 68|←]] • [[Psalms 70|→]]

---

### 1
For the choirmaster. [[H5329]] To the tune of [[H5921]] “Lilies.” [[H7799]] Of David. [[H1732]] Save me, [[H3467]] O God, [[H430]] for [[H3588]] the waters [[H4325]] are up [[H935]] to [[H5704]] my neck. [[H5315]]

### 2
I have sunk [[H2883]] into the miry [[H3121]] depths, [[H4688]] where [there is] no [[H369]] footing; [[H4613]] I have drifted [[H935]] into deep [[H4615]] waters, [[H4325]] where the flood [[H7641]] engulfs me. [[H7857]]

### 3
I am weary [[H3021]] from my crying; [[H7121]] my throat [[H1627]] is parched. [[H2787]] My eyes [[H5869]] fail, [[H3615]] looking [[H3176]] for my God. [[H430]]

### 4
Those who hate [[H8130]] me without cause [[H2600]] outnumber [[H7231]] the hairs [[H8185]] of my head; [[H7218]] many are [[H6105]] those who would destroy me— [[H6789]] my enemies [[H341]] without cause. [[H8267]] Though I did not [[H3808]] steal, [[H1497]] I must repay. [[H7725]]

### 5
You [[H859]] know [[H3045]] my folly, [[H200]] O God, [[H430]] and my guilt [[H819]] is not [[H3808]] hidden [[H3582]] from You. [[H4480]]

### 6
May those who hope in You [[H6960]] not [[H408]] be ashamed [[H954]] through me,  O Lord [[H136]] GOD [[H3069]] of Hosts; [[H6635]] may those who seek You [[H1245]] not [[H408]] be dishonored [[H3637]] through me,  O God [[H430]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

### 7
For [[H3588]] I have endured [[H5375]] scorn [[H2781]] for Your sake, [[H5921]] and shame [[H3639]] has covered [[H3680]] my face. [[H6440]]

### 8
I have become [[H1961]] a stranger [[H2114]] to my brothers [[H251]] and a foreigner [[H5237]] to my mother’s [[H517]] sons, [[H1121]]

### 9
because [[H3588]] zeal [[H7068]] for Your house [[H1004]] has consumed me, [[H398]] and the insults [[H2781]] of those who insult You [[H2778]] have fallen [[H5307]] on me. [[H5921]]

### 10
I [[H5315]] wept [[H1058]] and fasted, [[H6685]] but it brought [[H1961]] me reproach. [[H2781]]

### 11
I made [[H5414]] sackcloth [[H8242]] my clothing, [[H3830]] and I was [[H1961]] sport [[H4912]] to them. [[H1992]]

### 12
Those who sit [[H3427]] at the gate [[H8179]] mock me, [[H7878]] and I am the song [[H5058]] of drunkards. [[H8354]]

### 13
But [[H589]] my prayer [[H8605]] to You,  O LORD, [[H3068]] is for a time [[H6256]] of favor. [[H7522]] In Your abundant [[H7230]] loving devotion, [[H2617]] O God, [[H430]] answer me [[H6030]] with Your sure [[H571]] salvation. [[H3468]]

### 14
Rescue me [[H5337]] from the mire [[H2916]] and do not [[H408]] let me sink; [[H2883]] deliver me [[H5337]] from my foes [[H8130]] and out of the deep [[H4615]] waters. [[H4325]]

### 15
Do not [[H408]] let the floods [[H7641]] engulf me [[H7857]] or the depths [[H4688]] swallow me up; [[H1104]] let not [[H408]] the Pit [[H875]] close [[H332]] its mouth [[H6310]] over me. [[H5921]]

### 16
Answer me, [[H6030]] O LORD, [[H3068]] for [[H3588]] Your loving devotion [[H2617]] is good; [[H2896]] turn [[H6437]] to me [[H413]] in keeping with Your great [[H7230]] compassion. [[H7356]]

### 17
Hide [[H5641]] not [[H408]] Your face [[H6440]] from Your servant, [[H5650]] for [[H3588]] I am in distress. [[H6887]] Answer [[H6030]] me  quickly! [[H4118]]

### 18
Draw near [[H7126]] to [[H413]] my soul [[H5315]] and redeem me; [[H1350]] ransom me [[H6299]] because of [[H4616]] my foes. [[H341]]

### 19
You [[H859]] know [[H3045]] my reproach, [[H2781]] my shame [[H1322]] and disgrace. [[H3639]] All [[H3605]] my adversaries [[H6887]] are before You. [[H5048]]

### 20
Insults [[H2781]] have broken [[H7665]] my heart, [[H3820]] and I am in despair. [[H5136]] I looked [[H6960]] for sympathy, [[H5110]] but there was none, [[H369]] for comforters, [[H5162]] but I found [[H4672]] no one. [[H3808]]

### 21
They poisoned [[H5414]] my food [[H1267]] with gall [[H7219]] and gave me vinegar [[H2558]] to quench [[H8248]] my thirst. [[H6772]]

### 22
May their table [[H1961]] become [[H7979]] a snare; [[H6341]] may it be a retribution [[H7965]] and a trap. [[H4170]]

### 23
May their eyes [[H5869]] be darkened [[H2821]] so they cannot see, [[H7200]] and their backs [[H4975]] be bent [[H4571]] forever. [[H8548]]

### 24
Pour out [[H8210]] Your wrath [[H2195]] upon them, [[H5921]] and let Your burning anger [[H2740]] overtake them. [[H5381]]

### 25
May [[H1961]] their place [[H2918]] be deserted; [[H8074]] let there be no one [[H408]] to dwell [[H3427]] in their tents. [[H168]]

### 26
For [[H3588]] they persecute [[H7291]] the one [[H834]] You [[H859]] struck [[H5221]] and recount [[H5608]] the pain [[H4341]] of those You wounded. [[H2491]]

### 27
Add [[H5414]] iniquity [[H5771]] to [[H5921]] their iniquity; [[H5771]] let them not [[H408]] share [[H935]] in Your righteousness. [[H6666]]

### 28
May they be erased [[H4229]] from the book [[H5612]] of life [[H2416]] and not [[H408]] listed [[H3789]] with [[H5973]] the righteous. [[H6662]]

### 29
But I [am] [[H589]] in pain [[H6041]] and distress; [[H3510]] let Your salvation [[H3444]] protect me, [[H7682]] O God. [[H430]]

### 30
I will praise [[H1984]] God’s [[H430]] name [[H8034]] in song [[H7892]] and exalt [[H1431]] Him with thanksgiving. [[H8426]]

### 31
And this will please [[H3190]] the LORD [[H3068]] more than an ox, [[H7794]] more than a bull [[H6499]] with horns [[H7160]] and hooves. [[H6536]]

### 32
The humble [[H6035]] will see [[H7200]] and rejoice. [[H8055]] You who seek [[H1875]] God, [[H430]] let your hearts [[H3824]] be revived! [[H2421]]

### 33
For [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] listens [[H8085]] to [[H413]] the needy [[H34]] and does not [[H3808]] despise [[H959]] His captive people. [[H615]]

### 34
Let heaven [[H8064]] and earth [[H776]] praise Him, [[H1984]] the seas [[H3220]] and all [[H3605]] that moves [[H7430]] therein. 

### 35
For [[H3588]] God [[H430]] will save [[H3467]] Zion [[H6726]] and rebuild [[H1129]] the cities [[H5892]] of Judah, [[H3063]] that they may dwell [[H3427]] there [[H8033]] and possess it. [[H3423]]

### 36
The descendants [[H2233]] of His servants [[H5650]] will inherit it, [[H5157]] and those who love [[H157]] His name [[H8034]] will settle [[H7931]] therein.
