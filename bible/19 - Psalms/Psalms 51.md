###### 1
For the choirmaster. [[H5329]] A Psalm [[H4210]] of David. [[H1732]] When Nathan [[H5416]] the prophet [[H5030]] came [[H935]] to him [[H413]] after [[H834]] his adultery [[H935]] with [[H413]] Bathsheba. [[H1339]] Have mercy on me, [[H2603]] O God, [[H430]] according to Your loving devotion; [[H2617]] according to Your great [[H7230]] compassion, [[H7356]] blot out [[H4229]] my transgressions. [[H6588]]

###### 2
Wash me clean [[H7235]] of my iniquity [[H5771]] and cleanse me [[H2891]] from my sin. [[H2403]]

###### 3
For [[H3588]] I [[H589]] know [[H3045]] my transgressions, [[H6588]] and my sin [[H2403]] is always [[H8548]] before me. [[H5048]]

###### 4
Against You,  You only, [[H905]] have I sinned [[H2398]] and done [[H6213]] what is evil [[H7451]] in Your sight, [[H5869]] so that [[H4616]] You may be found just [[H6663]] when You speak [[H1696]] and blameless [[H2135]] when You judge. [[H8199]]

###### 5
Surely [[H2005]] I was brought forth [[H2342]] in iniquity; [[H5771]] I was sinful [[H2399]] when my mother [[H517]] conceived me. [[H3179]]

###### 6
Surely [[H2005]] You desire [[H2654]] truth [[H571]] in the inmost being; [[H2910]] You teach me [[H3045]] wisdom [[H2451]] in the inmost place. [[H5640]]

###### 7
Purify [[H2398]] me with hyssop, [[H231]] and I will be clean; [[H2891]] wash me, [[H3526]] and I will be whiter [[H3835]] than snow. [[H7950]]

###### 8
Let me hear [[H8085]] joy [[H8342]] and gladness; [[H8057]] let the bones [[H6106]] You have crushed [[H1794]] rejoice. [[H1523]]

###### 9
Hide [[H5641]] Your face [[H6440]] from my sins [[H2399]] and blot out [[H4229]] all [[H3605]] my iniquities. [[H5771]]

###### 10
Create [[H1254]] in me  a clean [[H2889]] heart, [[H3820]] O God, [[H430]] and renew [[H2318]] a right [[H3559]] spirit [[H7307]] within me. [[H7130]]

###### 11
Cast me not away [[H7993]] from [[H4480]] Your presence; [[H6440]] take [[H3947]] not [[H408]] Your Holy [[H6944]] Spirit from me. [[H7307]]

###### 12
Restore [[H7725]] to me  the joy [[H8342]] of Your salvation, [[H3468]] and sustain me [[H5564]] with a willing [[H5081]] spirit. [[H7307]]

###### 13
Then I will teach [[H3925]] transgressors [[H6586]] Your ways, [[H1870]] and sinners [[H2400]] will return [[H7725]] to You. [[H413]]

###### 14
Deliver me [[H5337]] from bloodguilt, [[H1818]] O God, [[H430]] the God [[H430]] of my salvation, [[H8668]] and my tongue [[H3956]] will sing [[H7442]] of Your righteousness. [[H6666]]

###### 15
O Lord, [[H136]] open [[H6605]] my lips, [[H8193]] and my mouth [[H6310]] will declare [[H5046]] Your praise. [[H8416]]

###### 16
For [[H3588]] You do not [[H3808]] delight [[H2654]] in sacrifice, [[H2077]] or I would bring it; [[H5414]] You take no pleasure [[H7521]] in burnt offerings. [[H5930]]

###### 17
The sacrifices [[H2077]] of God [[H430]] [are] a broken [[H7665]] spirit; [[H7307]] a broken [[H7665]] and a contrite [[H1794]] heart, [[H3820]] O God, [[H430]] You will not [[H3808]] despise. [[H959]]

###### 18
In Your good pleasure, [[H7522]] cause Zion [[H6726]] to prosper; [[H3190]] build up [[H1129]] the walls [[H2346]] of Jerusalem. [[H3389]]

###### 19
Then [[H227]] You will delight [[H2654]] in righteous [[H6664]] sacrifices, [[H2077]] in whole [[H3632]] burnt offerings; [[H5930]] then [[H227]] bulls [[H6499]] will be offered [[H5927]] on [[H5921]] Your altar. [[H4196]]
