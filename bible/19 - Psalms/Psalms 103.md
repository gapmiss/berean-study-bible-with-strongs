###### 1
Of David. [[H1732]] Bless [[H1288]] the LORD, [[H3068]] O my soul, [[H5315]] and all [[H3605]] that is within me, [[H7130]] [bless] His holy [[H6944]] name. [[H8034]]

###### 2
Bless [[H1288]] the LORD, [[H3068]] O my soul, [[H5315]] and do not [[H408]] forget [[H7911]] all [[H3605]] His kind deeds— [[H1576]]

###### 3
He who forgives [[H5545]] all [[H3605]] your iniquities, [[H5771]] and heals [[H7495]] all [[H3605]] your diseases, [[H8463]]

###### 4
who redeems [[H1350]] your life [[H2416]] from the pit, [[H7845]] [and] crowns [[H5849]] you with loving devotion [[H2617]] and compassion, [[H7356]]

###### 5
who satisfies you [[H7646]] with good [[H2896]] things, [[H5716]] so that your youth [[H5271]] is renewed [[H2318]] like the eagle’s. [[H5404]]

###### 6
The LORD [[H3068]] executes [[H6213]] righteousness [[H6666]] and justice [[H4941]] for all [[H3605]] the oppressed. [[H6231]]

###### 7
He revealed [[H3045]] His ways [[H1870]] to Moses, [[H4872]] His deeds [[H5949]] to the people [[H1121]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

###### 8
The LORD [[H3068]] is compassionate [[H7349]] and gracious, [[H2587]] slow [[H750]] to anger, [[H639]] abounding [[H7227]] in loving devotion. [[H2617]]

###### 9
He will not [[H3808]] always [[H5331]] accuse us, [[H7378]] nor [[H3808]] harbor [His anger] [[H5201]] forever. [[H5769]]

###### 10
He has not [[H3808]] dealt [[H6213]] with us [[H3808]] according to  our sins [[H2399]] or repaid us [[H1580]] according to [[H5921]] our iniquities. [[H5771]]

###### 11
For [[H3588]] as high [[H1361]] as the heavens [[H8064]] are above [[H5921]] the earth, [[H776]] so great [[H1396]] is His loving devotion [[H2617]] for [[H5921]] those who fear Him. [[H3373]]

###### 12
As far [[H7368]] as the east [[H4217]] is from [[H4480]] the west, [[H4628]] so far has He removed [[H7368]] our transgressions from us. [[H6588]]

###### 13
As a father [[H1]] has compassion [[H7355]] on [[H5921]] his children, [[H1121]] so the LORD [[H3068]] has compassion [[H7355]] on [[H5921]] those who fear Him. [[H3373]]

###### 14
For [[H3588]] He [[H1931]] knows [[H3045]] our frame; [[H3336]] He is mindful [[H2142]] that [[H3588]] we [[H587]] are dust. [[H6083]]

###### 15
As for man, [[H376]] his days [[H3117]] are like grass— [[H2682]] he blooms [[H6692]] like a flower [[H6731]] of the field; [[H7704]]

###### 16
when [[H3588]] the wind [[H7307]] has passed over, [[H5674]] it vanishes, [[H369]] and its place [[H4725]] remembers it [[H5234]] no [[H3808]] more. [[H5750]]

###### 17
But from everlasting [[H5769]] to [[H5704]] everlasting [[H5769]] the loving devotion [[H2617]] of the LORD [[H3068]] extends to [[H5921]] those who fear Him, [[H3373]] and His righteousness [[H6666]] to their children’s [[H1121]] children— [[H1121]]

###### 18
to those who keep [[H8104]] His covenant [[H1285]] and remember [[H2142]] to obey [[H6213]] His precepts. [[H6490]]

###### 19
The LORD [[H3068]] has established [[H3559]] His throne [[H3678]] in heaven, [[H8064]] and His kingdom [[H4438]] rules [[H4910]] over all. [[H3605]]

###### 20
Bless [[H1288]] the LORD, [[H3068]] all His angels [[H4397]] mighty [[H1368]] in strength, [[H3581]] who do [[H6213]] His word, [[H1697]] who hearken [[H8085]] to the voice [[H6963]] of His command. [[H1697]]

###### 21
Bless [[H1288]] the LORD, [[H3068]] all [[H3605]] His hosts, [[H6635]] you servants [[H8334]] who do [[H6213]] His will. [[H7522]]

###### 22
Bless [[H1288]] the LORD, [[H3068]] all [[H3605]] His works [[H4639]] in all [[H3605]] places [[H4725]] of His dominion. [[H4475]] Bless [[H1288]] the LORD, [[H3068]] O my soul! [[H5315]]
