### 1
A Psalm [[H4210]] of Asaph. [[H623]] God [[H430]] presides [[H5324]] in the divine [[H410]] assembly; [[H5712]] He renders judgment [[H8199]] among [[H7130]] the gods: [[H430]]

### 2
“How long [[H5704]] will you judge [[H8199]] unjustly [[H5766]] and show partiality [[H6440]] to the wicked? [[H7563]] Selah [[H5542]]

### 3
Defend the cause [[H8199]] of the weak [[H1800]] and fatherless; [[H3490]] uphold the rights [[H6663]] of the afflicted [[H6041]] and oppressed. [[H7326]]

### 4
Rescue [[H6403]] the weak [[H1800]] and needy; [[H34]] save them [[H5337]] from the hand [[H3027]] of the wicked. [[H7563]]

### 5
They do not [[H3808]] know [[H3045]] or understand; [[H995]] they wander [[H1980]] in the darkness; [[H2825]] all [[H3605]] the foundations [[H4144]] of the earth [[H776]] are shaken.” [[H4131]]

### 6
I [[H589]] have said, [[H559]] “You [[H859]] are gods; [[H430]] you are all [[H3605]] sons [[H1121]] of the Most High. [[H5945]]

### 7
But [[H403]] like mortals [[H120]] you will die, [[H4191]] and like [[H259]] rulers [[H8269]] you will fall.” [[H5307]]

### 8
Rise up, [[H6965]] O God, [[H430]] judge [[H8199]] the earth, [[H776]] for [[H3588]] all [[H3605]] the nations [[H1471]] are Your [[H859]] inheritance. [[H5157]]
