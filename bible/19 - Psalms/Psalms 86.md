###### 1
A Prayer [[H8605]] of David. [[H1732]] Incline [[H5186]] Your ear, [[H241]] O LORD, [[H3068]] and answer me, [[H6030]] for [[H3588]] I [[H589]] am poor [[H6041]] and needy. [[H34]]

###### 2
Preserve [[H8104]] my soul, [[H5315]] for [[H3588]] I [am] [[H589]] godly. [[H2623]] You [[H859]] are my God; [[H430]] save [[H3467]] Your servant [[H5650]] who trusts [[H982]] in You. [[H413]]

###### 3
Be merciful to me, [[H2603]] O Lord, [[H136]] for [[H3588]] I call [[H7121]] to You [[H413]] all [[H3605]] day long. [[H3117]]

###### 4
Bring joy [[H8055]] to Your servant, [[H5650]] for [[H3588]] to You, [[H413]] O Lord, [[H136]] I lift up [[H5375]] my soul. [[H5315]]

###### 5
For [[H3588]] You, [[H859]] O Lord, [[H136]] are kind [[H2896]] and forgiving, [[H5546]] rich [[H7227]] in loving devotion [[H2617]] to all [[H3605]] who call on You. [[H7121]]

###### 6
Hear [[H238]] my prayer, [[H8605]] O LORD, [[H3068]] and attend [[H7181]] to my plea [[H6963]] for mercy. [[H8469]]

###### 7
In the day [[H3117]] of my distress [[H6869]] I will call on You, [[H7121]] for [[H3588]] You will answer me. [[H6030]]

###### 8
O Lord, [[H136]] [there is] none [[H369]] like You [[H3644]] among the gods, [[H430]] nor any [[H369]] works like Yours. [[H4639]]

###### 9
All [[H3605]] the nations [[H1471]] You have made [[H6213]] will come [[H935]] and bow [[H7812]] before You, [[H6440]] O Lord, [[H136]] and they will glorify [[H3513]] Your name. [[H8034]]

###### 10
For [[H3588]] You [[H859]] are great [[H1419]] and perform [[H6213]] wonders; [[H6381]] You [[H859]] alone [[H905]] are God. [[H430]]

###### 11
Teach me [[H3384]] Your way, [[H1870]] O LORD, [[H3068]] and I will walk [[H1980]] in Your truth. [[H571]] Grant me undividedness [[H3161]] of heart [[H3824]] so that I may fear [[H3372]] Your name. [[H8034]]

###### 12
I will praise You, [[H3034]] O Lord [[H136]] my God, [[H430]] with all [[H3605]] my heart; [[H3824]] I will glorify [[H3513]] Your name [[H8034]] forever. [[H5769]]

###### 13
For [[H3588]] great is [[H1419]] Your loving devotion [[H2617]] to me; [[H5921]] You have delivered [[H5337]] me [[H5315]] from the depths [[H8482]] of Sheol. [[H7585]]

###### 14
The arrogant [[H2086]] rise [[H6965]] against me, [[H5921]] O God; [[H430]] a band [[H5712]] of ruthless men [[H6184]] seeks [[H1245]] my life, [[H5315]] with no [[H3808]] regard [[H7760]] for You. [[H5048]]

###### 15
But You, [[H859]] O Lord, [[H136]] are a compassionate [[H7349]] and gracious [[H2587]] God, [[H410]] slow [[H750]] to anger, [[H639]] abounding [[H7227]] in loving devotion [[H2617]] and truth. [[H571]]

###### 16
Turn [[H6437]] to me [[H413]] and have mercy; [[H2603]] grant [[H5414]] Your strength [[H5797]] to Your servant; [[H5650]] save [[H3467]] the son [[H1121]] of Your maidservant. [[H519]]

###### 17
Show [[H6213]] me [[H5973]] a sign [[H226]] of Your goodness, [[H2896]] that my enemies [[H8130]] may see [[H7200]] and be ashamed, [[H954]] for [[H3588]] You, [[H859]] O LORD, [[H3068]] have helped me [[H5826]] and comforted me. [[H5162]]
