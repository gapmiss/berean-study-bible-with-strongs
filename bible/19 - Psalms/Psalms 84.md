### 1
For the choirmaster. [[H5329]] According to [[H5921]] Gittith. [[H1665]] A Psalm [[H4210]] of the sons [[H1121]] of Korah. [[H7141]] How [[H4100]] lovely [[H3039]] is Your dwelling place, [[H4908]] O LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts. [[H6635]]

### 2
My soul [[H5315]] longs, [[H3700]] even [[H1571]] faints, [[H3615]] for the courts [[H2691]] of the LORD; [[H3068]] my heart [[H3820]] and my flesh [[H1320]] cry out [[H7442]] for [[H413]] the living [[H2416]] God. [[H410]]

### 3
Even [[H1571]] the sparrow [[H6833]] has found [[H4672]] a home, [[H1004]] and the swallow [[H1866]] a nest for herself [[H7064]] where [[H834]] she places [[H7896]] her young [[H667]] by Your altars, [[H4196]] O LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts, [[H6635]] my King [[H4428]] and my God. [[H430]]

### 4
How blessed [[H835]] are those who dwell [[H3427]] in Your house; [[H1004]] they are ever [[H5750]] praising You. [[H1984]] Selah [[H5542]]

### 5
Blessed [[H835]] are those [[H120]] whose strength [[H5797]] is in You,  whose hearts [[H3824]] are set on pilgrimage. [[H4546]]

### 6
As they pass [[H5674]] through the Valley [[H6010]] of Baca, [[H1056]] they make it [[H7896]] a place of springs; [[H4599]] even [[H1571]] the autumn rain [[H4175]] covers it [[H5844]] with pools. [[H1293]]

### 7
They go [[H1980]] from strength [[H2428]] to [[H413]] strength, [[H2428]] until each appears [[H7200]] before [[H413]] God [[H430]] in Zion. [[H6726]]

### 8
O LORD [[H3068]] God [[H430]] of Hosts, [[H6635]] hear [[H8085]] my prayer; [[H8605]] give ear, [[H238]] O God [[H430]] of Jacob. [[H3290]] Selah [[H5542]]

### 9
Behold [[H7200]] our shield, [[H4043]] O God, [[H430]] and look with favor [[H5027]] on the face [[H6440]] of Your anointed. [[H4899]]

### 10
For [[H3588]] better [[H2896]] is one day [[H3117]] in Your courts [[H2691]] than a thousand elsewhere. [[H505]] I would rather [[H977]] be a doorkeeper [[H5605]] in the house [[H1004]] of my God [[H430]] than to dwell [[H1752]] in the tents [[H168]] of the wicked. [[H7562]]

### 11
For [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] God [[H430]] is a sun [[H8121]] and a shield; [[H4043]] the LORD [[H3068]] gives [[H5414]] grace [[H2580]] and glory; [[H3519]] He withholds [[H4513]] no [[H3808]] good thing [[H2896]] from those who walk [[H1980]] with integrity. [[H8549]]

### 12
O LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts, [[H6635]] how blessed [[H835]] is the man [[H120]] who trusts in You! [[H982]]
