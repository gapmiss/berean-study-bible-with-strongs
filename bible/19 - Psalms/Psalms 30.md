### 1
A Psalm. [[H4210]] A Song [[H7892]] for the dedication [[H2598]] of the temple. [[H1004]] Of David. [[H1732]] I will exalt You, [[H7311]] O LORD, [[H3068]] for [[H3588]] You have lifted me up [[H1802]] and have not [[H3808]] allowed my foes [[H341]] to rejoice over me. [[H8055]]

### 2
O LORD [[H3068]] my God, [[H430]] {I cried} to You [[H413]] for help, [[H7768]] and You healed me. [[H7495]]

### 3
O LORD, [[H3068]] You pulled me [[H5315]] up [[H5927]] from [[H4480]] Sheol; [[H7585]] You spared me [[H2421]] from descending [[H3381]] into the Pit. [[H3381]]

### 4
Sing [[H2167]] to the LORD, [[H3068]] O you His saints, [[H2623]] and give thanks [[H3034]] to His holy [[H6944]] name. [[H2143]]

### 5
For [[H3588]] His anger [[H639]] is fleeting, [[H7281]] but His favor [[H7522]] lasts a lifetime. [[H2416]] Weeping [[H1065]] may stay [[H3885]] the night, [[H6153]] but joy [comes] [[H7440]] in the morning. [[H1242]]

### 6
In prosperity [[H7959]] I [[H589]] said, [[H559]] “I will never [[H1077]] be shaken.” [[H4131]]

### 7
O LORD, [[H3068]] You favored me; [[H7522]] You made [[H5975]] my mountain [[H2042]] {stand} strong. [[H5797]] When You hid [[H5641]] Your face, [[H6440]] I was [[H1961]] dismayed. [[H926]]

### 8
To You, [[H413]] O LORD, [[H3068]] I called, [[H7121]] and [[H413]] I begged [[H2603]] my Lord {for mercy}: [[H136]]

### 9
“What [[H4100]] gain [[H1215]] is in the shedding of my blood, [[H1818]] in my descent [[H3381]] to [[H413]] the Pit? [[H7845]] Will the dust [[H6083]] praise You? [[H3034]] Will it proclaim [[H5046]] Your faithfulness? [[H571]]

### 10
Hear me, [[H8085]] O LORD, [[H3068]] and have mercy; [[H2603]] O LORD, [[H3068]] be [[H1961]] my helper.” [[H5826]]

### 11
You turned [[H2015]] my mourning [[H4553]] into dancing; [[H4234]] You peeled off [[H6605]] my sackcloth [[H8242]] and clothed me [[H247]] with joy, [[H8057]]

### 12
that my heart [[H4616]] may sing [[H2167]] Your praises [[H3519]] and not [[H3808]] be silent. [[H1826]] O LORD [[H3068]] my God, [[H430]] I will give thanks [[H3034]] forever. [[H5769]]
