### 1
A Song [[H7892]] of Ascents. [[H4609]] Out of the depths [[H4615]] I cry to You, [[H7121]] O LORD! [[H3068]]

### 2
O LORD, [[H136]] hear [[H8085]] my voice; [[H6963]] let Your ears [[H241]] be [[H1961]] attentive [[H7183]] to my plea for mercy. [[H8469]]

### 3
If You, [[H518]] O LORD, [[H3050]] kept track [[H8104]] of iniquities, [[H5771]] O Lord, [[H136]] who [[H4310]] could stand? [[H5975]]

### 4
But [[H3588]] with You [[H5973]] there is forgiveness, [[H5547]] that [[H4616]] You may be feared. [[H3372]]

### 5
I wait for [[H6960]] the LORD; [[H3068]] my soul [[H5315]] does wait, [[H6960]] and in His word [[H1697]] I put my hope. [[H3176]]

### 6
My soul [[H5315]] [waits] for the Lord [[H136]] more than watchmen [[H8104]] for the morning— [[H1242]] more than watchmen waiting [[H8104]] for the morning. [[H1242]]

### 7
O Israel, [[H3478]] put your hope [[H3176]] in [[H413]] the LORD, [[H3068]] for [[H3588]] with [[H5973]] the LORD [[H3068]] is loving devotion, [[H2617]] and with Him [[H5973]] is redemption [[H6304]] in abundance. [[H7235]]

### 8
And He [[H1931]] will redeem [[H6299]] Israel [[H3478]] from all [[H3605]] its iniquities. [[H5771]]
