[[Psalms 54|←]] • [[Psalms 56|→]]

---

###### 1
For the choirmaster. [[H5329]] With stringed instruments. [[H5058]] A Maskil [[H4905]] of David. [[H1732]] Listen [[H238]] to my prayer, [[H8605]] O God, [[H430]] and do not [[H408]] ignore [[H5956]] my plea. [[H8467]]

###### 2
Attend [[H7181]] to me  and answer me. [[H6030]] I am restless [[H7300]] in my complaint, [[H7879]] and distraught [[H1949]]

###### 3
at the voice [[H6963]] of the enemy, [[H341]] at [[H6440]] the pressure [[H6125]] of the wicked. [[H7563]] For [[H3588]] they release [[H4131]] disaster [[H205]] upon me [[H5921]] and revile me [[H7852]] in their anger. [[H639]]

###### 4
My heart [[H3820]] murmurs [[H2342]] within me, [[H7130]] and the terrors [[H367]] of death [[H4194]] assail [[H5307]] me. [[H5921]]

###### 5
Fear [[H3374]] and trembling [[H7461]] grip me, [[H935]] and horror [[H6427]] has overwhelmed me. [[H3680]]

###### 6
I said, [[H559]] “Oh, [[H4310]] that [[H5414]] I had wings [[H83]] like a dove! [[H3123]] I would fly away [[H5774]] and find rest. [[H7931]]

###### 7
How [[H2009]] far away [[H7368]] I would flee; [[H5074]] in the wilderness [[H4057]] I would remain. [[H3885]] Selah [[H5542]]

###### 8
I would hurry [[H2363]] to my shelter [[H4655]] far from  this raging [[H7307]] tempest.” [[H5591]]

###### 9
O Lord, [[H136]] confuse [[H1104]] and confound [[H6385]] their speech, [[H3956]] for [[H3588]] I see [[H7200]] violence [[H2555]] and strife [[H7379]] in the city. [[H5892]]

###### 10
Day [[H3119]] and night [[H3915]] they encircle [[H5437]] the walls, [[H2346]] while malice [[H205]] and trouble [[H5999]] [lie] within. [[H7130]]

###### 11
Destruction [[H1942]] [is] in the midst; [[H7130]] oppression [[H8496]] and deceit [[H4820]] never [[H3808]] leave [[H4185]] the streets. [[H7339]]

###### 12
For [[H3588]] it is not [[H3808]] an enemy [[H341]] who insults me— [[H2778]] then I could endure; [[H5375]] it is not [[H3808]] a foe [[H8130]] who rises [[H1431]] against me— [[H5921]] from him [[H4480]] I could hide. [[H5641]]

###### 13
But it is you, [[H859]] a man [[H582]] like myself, [[H6187]] my companion [[H441]] and close friend. [[H3045]]

###### 14
We [[H834]] shared sweet [[H4985]] fellowship [[H5475]] together; [[H3162]] we walked [[H1980]] with the crowd [[H7285]] into the house [[H1004]] of God. [[H430]]

###### 15
Let death [[H3451]] seize them by surprise; [[H5921]] let them go down [[H3381]] to Sheol [[H7585]] alive, [[H2416]] for [[H3588]] evil [[H7451]] is with them [[H7130]] in their homes. [[H4033]]

###### 16
But I [[H589]] call [[H7121]] to [[H413]] God, [[H430]] and the LORD [[H3068]] will save me. [[H3467]]

###### 17
Morning, [[H1242]] noon, [[H6672]] and night, [[H6153]] I cry out [[H1993]] in distress, [[H7878]] and He will hear [[H8085]] my voice. [[H6963]]

###### 18
He will redeem [[H6299]] my soul [[H5315]] in peace [[H7965]] from the battle; [[H7128]] though [[H3588]] many [[H7227]] are [[H1961]] against me, [[H5978]]

###### 19
God [[H410]] will hear [[H8085]] and humiliate them— [[H6031]] the One enthroned [[H3427]] for the ages— [[H6924]] Selah [[H5542]] because [[H834]] they do not [[H369]] change [[H2487]] and they have no [[H3808]] fear [[H3372]] of God. [[H430]]

###### 20
My companion attacks [[H7971]] his friends; [[H7965]] he violates [[H2490]] his covenant. [[H1285]]

###### 21
His speech [[H6310]] is smooth [[H2505]] as butter, [[H4260]] but war [[H7128]] is in his heart. [[H3820]] His words [[H1697]] are softer [[H7401]] than oil, [[H8081]] yet they are [[H1992]] swords unsheathed. [[H6609]]

###### 22
Cast [[H7993]] your burden [[H3053]] upon [[H5921]] the LORD [[H3068]] and He [[H1931]] will sustain you; [[H3557]] He will never [[H3808]] let [[H5414]] the righteous [[H6662]] be shaken. [[H4131]]

###### 23
But You, [[H859]] O God, [[H430]] will bring them down [[H3381]] to the Pit [[H875]] of destruction; [[H7845]] men [[H582]] of bloodshed [[H1818]] and deceit [[H4820]] will not [[H3808]] live out half [[H2673]] their days. [[H3117]] But I [[H589]] will trust [[H982]] in You.
