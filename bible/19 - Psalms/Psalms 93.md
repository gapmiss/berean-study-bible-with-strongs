###### 1
The LORD [[H3068]] reigns! [[H4427]] He is robed [[H3847]] in majesty; [[H1348]] the LORD [[H3068]] has clothed [[H3847]] and armed Himself [[H247]] with strength. [[H5797]] The world [[H8398]] indeed [[H637]] is firmly established; [[H3559]] it cannot [[H1077]] be moved. [[H4131]]

###### 2
Your throne [[H3678]] [was] established [[H3559]] long ago; [[H227]] You [[H859]] [are] from all eternity. [[H5769]]

###### 3
The floodwaters [[H5104]] have risen, [[H5375]] O LORD, [[H3068]] the rivers [[H5104]] have raised [[H5375]] their voice; [[H6963]] the seas [[H5104]] lift up [[H5375]] their pounding waves. [[H1796]]

###### 4
Above the roar [[H6963]] of many [[H7227]] waters— [[H4325]] the mighty [[H117]] breakers [[H4867]] of the sea— [[H3220]] the LORD [[H3068]] on high [[H4791]] is majestic. [[H117]]

###### 5
Your testimonies [[H5713]] are fully [[H3966]] confirmed; [[H539]] holiness [[H6944]] adorns [[H4998]] Your house, [[H1004]] O LORD, [[H3068]] for all the days [[H753]] to come. [[H3117]]
