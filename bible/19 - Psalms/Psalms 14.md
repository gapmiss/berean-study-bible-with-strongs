###### 1
For the choirmaster. [[H5329]] Of David. [[H1732]] The fool [[H5036]] says [[H559]] in his heart, [[H3820]] “[There is] no [[H369]] God.” [[H430]] They are corrupt; [[H7843]] their acts [[H5949]] are vile. [[H8581]] There is no [[H369]] one who does [[H6213]] good. [[H2896]]

###### 2
The LORD [[H3068]] looks down [[H8259]] from heaven [[H8064]] upon [[H5921]] the sons [[H1121]] of men [[H120]] to see [[H7200]] if any [[H3426]] understand, [[H7919]] if any seek [[H1875]] God. [[H430]]

###### 3
All [[H3605]] have turned away, [[H5493]] they have together [[H3162]] become corrupt; [[H444]] there is no [[H369]] one who does [[H6213]] good, [[H2896]] not [[H369]] even [[H1571]] one. [[H259]]

###### 4
Will the workers [[H6466]] of iniquity [[H205]] never [[H3808]] learn? [[H3045]] They devour [[H398]] my people [[H5971]] [like] [[H398]] bread; [[H3899]] they refuse [[H3808]] to call upon [[H7121]] the LORD. [[H3068]]

###### 5
There they are, [[H8033]] overwhelmed [[H6342]] with dread, [[H6343]] for [[H3588]] God [[H430]] [is] in the company [[H1755]] of the righteous. [[H6662]]

###### 6
You [sinners] frustrate [[H954]] the plans [[H6098]] of the oppressed, [[H6041]] yet [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] is their shelter. [[H4268]]

###### 7
Oh, that [[H4310]] the salvation [[H3444]] of Israel [[H3478]] would come [[H5414]] from Zion! [[H6726]] When the LORD [[H3068]] restores [[H7725]] His captive [[H7622]] people, [[H5971]] let Jacob [[H3290]] rejoice, [[H1523]] let Israel [[H3478]] be glad. [[H8055]]
