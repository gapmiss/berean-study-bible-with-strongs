###### 1
A Song [[H7892]] of Ascents. [[H4609]] Of David. [[H1732]] My heart [[H3820]] is not [[H3808]] proud, [[H1361]] O LORD, [[H3068]] my eyes [[H5869]] are not [[H3808]] haughty. [[H7311]] I do not [[H3808]] aspire [[H1980]] to great matters [[H1419]] or things too lofty [[H6381]] for me. [[H4480]]

###### 2
Surely [[H518]] I have stilled [[H7737]] and quieted [[H1826]] my soul; [[H5315]] like a weaned child [[H1580]] with his mother, [[H517]] like a weaned child [[H1580]] is my soul [[H5315]] within me. [[H5921]]

###### 3
O Israel, [[H3478]] put your hope [[H3176]] in [[H413]] the LORD, [[H3068]] both now [[H6258]] and forevermore. [[H5704]]
