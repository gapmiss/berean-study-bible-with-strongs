###### 1
For the choirmaster. [[H5329]] A Psalm [[H4210]] of David. [[H1732]] O LORD, [[H3068]] You have searched me [[H2713]] and known me. [[H3045]]

###### 2
You [[H859]] know [[H3045]] when I sit [[H3427]] and when I rise; [[H6965]] You understand [[H995]] my thoughts [[H7454]] from afar. [[H7350]]

###### 3
You search out [[H2219]] my path [[H734]] and my lying down; [[H7252]] You are aware [[H5532]] of all [[H3605]] my ways. [[H1870]]

###### 4
Even [[H3588]] before a word [[H4405]] is on my tongue, [[H3956]] You know [[H3045]] all about it, [[H3605]] O LORD. [[H3068]]

###### 5
You hem me in [[H6696]] behind [[H268]] and before; [[H6924]] You have laid [[H7896]] Your hand [[H3709]] upon me. [[H5921]]

###### 6
[Such] knowledge [[H1847]] [is] too wonderful [[H6383]] for me, [[H4480]] too lofty [[H7682]] for me to attain. [[H3201]]

###### 7
Where [[H575]] can I go [[H1980]] to escape Your Spirit? [[H7307]] Where [[H575]] can I flee [[H1272]] from Your presence? [[H6440]]

###### 8
If [[H518]] I ascend [[H5266]] to the heavens, [[H8064]] You [[H859]] are there; [[H8033]] if I make my bed [[H3331]] in Sheol, [[H7585]] You are there. [[H2005]]

###### 9
If I rise on [[H5375]] the wings [[H3671]] of the dawn, [[H7837]] if I settle [[H7931]] by the farthest [[H319]] sea, [[H3220]]

###### 10
even [[H1571]] there [[H8033]] Your hand [[H3027]] will guide me; [[H5148]] Your right hand [[H3225]] will hold me fast. [[H270]]

###### 11
If I say, [[H559]] “Surely [[H389]] the darkness [[H2822]] will hide me, [[H7779]] and the light [[H216]] become night [[H3915]] around me”— [[H1157]]

###### 12
even [[H1571]] the darkness [[H2822]] is not [[H3808]] dark [[H2821]] to You, [[H4480]] but the night [[H3915]] shines [[H215]] like the day, [[H3117]] for darkness [[H2825]] is as light to You. [[H219]]

###### 13
For [[H3588]] You [[H859]] formed [[H7069]] my inmost being; [[H3629]] You knit me together [[H5526]] in my mother’s [[H517]] womb. [[H990]]

###### 14
I will praise [[H3034]] You, [[H5921]] for [[H3588]] I am fearfully [[H3372]] and wonderfully made. [[H6395]] Marvelous [[H6381]] [are] Your works, [[H4639]] and I [[H5315]] know this [[H3045]] very well. [[H3966]]

###### 15
My frame [[H6108]] was not [[H3808]] hidden [[H3582]] from You [[H4480]] when [[H834]] I was made [[H6213]] in secret, [[H5643]] when I was woven together [[H7551]] in the depths [[H8482]] of the earth. [[H776]]

###### 16
Your eyes [[H5869]] saw [[H7200]] my unformed body; [[H1564]] all [[H3605]] my days [[H3117]] were written [[H3789]] in [[H5921]] Your book [[H5612]] and ordained for me [[H3335]] before one of them came to be. [[H259]]

###### 17
How [[H4100]] precious to me [[H3365]] are Your thoughts, [[H7454]] O God, [[H410]] how [[H4100]] vast [[H6105]] is their sum! [[H7218]]

###### 18
[If] I were to count them, [[H5608]] they would outnumber [[H7235]] the grains of sand; [[H2344]] when I awake, [[H6974]] I am still [[H5750]] with You. [[H5973]]

###### 19
O [[H518]] God, [[H433]] that You would slay [[H6991]] the wicked— [[H7563]] away [[H5493]] from me, [[H4480]] you bloodthirsty [[H1818]] men— [[H582]]

###### 20
who [[H834]] invoke You [[H559]] with deceit; [[H4209]] Your enemies [[H6145]] take [[H5375]] [Your name] in vain. [[H7723]]

###### 21
Do I not [[H3808]] hate [[H8130]] those who hate You, [[H8130]] O LORD, [[H3068]] and detest [[H6962]] those who rise against You? [[H8618]]

###### 22
I hate [[H8130]] them with perfect [[H8503]] hatred; [[H8135]] I count them [[H1961]] as my enemies. [[H341]]

###### 23
Search me, [[H2713]] O God, [[H410]] and know [[H3045]] my heart; [[H3824]] test [[H974]] me and know [[H3045]] my concerns. [[H8312]]

###### 24
See [[H7200]] if [[H518]] there is any offensive [[H6090]] way [[H1870]] in me;  lead me [[H5148]] in the way [[H1870]] everlasting. [[H5769]]
