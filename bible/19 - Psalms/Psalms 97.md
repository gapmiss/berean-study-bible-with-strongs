### 1
The LORD [[H3068]] reigns, [[H4427]] let the earth [[H776]] rejoice; [[H1523]] let the distant [[H7227]] shores [[H339]] be glad. [[H8055]]

### 2
Clouds [[H6051]] and darkness [[H6205]] surround Him; [[H5439]] righteousness [[H6664]] and justice [[H4941]] are His throne’s [[H3678]] foundation. [[H4349]]

### 3
Fire [[H784]] goes [[H1980]] before Him [[H6440]] and consumes [[H3857]] His foes [[H6862]] on every side. [[H5439]]

### 4
His lightning [[H1300]] illuminates [[H215]] the world; [[H8398]] the earth [[H776]] sees [[H7200]] and trembles. [[H2342]]

### 5
The mountains [[H2022]] melt [[H4549]] like wax [[H1749]] at the presence [[H6440]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] before [[H6440]] the Lord [[H113]] of all [[H3605]] the earth. [[H776]]

### 6
The heavens [[H8064]] proclaim [[H5046]] His righteousness; [[H6664]] all [[H3605]] the peoples [[H5971]] see [[H7200]] His glory. [[H3519]]

### 7
All [[H3605]] who worship [[H5647]] images [[H6459]] are put to shame, [[H954]] those who boast [[H1984]] in idols— [[H457]] worship [[H7812]] Him,  all [[H3605]] [you] gods! [[H430]]

### 8
Zion [[H6726]] hears [[H8085]] and rejoices, [[H8055]] and the towns [[H1323]] of Judah [[H3063]] exult [[H1523]] because of [[H4616]] Your judgments, [[H4941]] O LORD. [[H3068]]

### 9
For [[H3588]] You, [[H859]] O LORD, [[H3068]] are Most High [[H5945]] over [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] the earth; [[H776]] You are exalted [[H5927]] far [[H3966]] above [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] gods. [[H430]]

### 10
O you who love [[H157]] the LORD, [[H3068]] hate [[H8130]] evil! [[H7451]] He preserves [[H8104]] the souls [[H5315]] of His saints; [[H2623]] He delivers them [[H5337]] from the hand [[H3027]] of the wicked. [[H7563]]

### 11
Light [[H216]] is sown [[H2232]] on the righteous, [[H6662]] gladness [[H8057]] on the upright [[H3477]] in heart. [[H3820]]

### 12
Rejoice [[H8055]] in the LORD, [[H3068]] you righteous ones, [[H6662]] and praise [[H3034]] His holy [[H6944]] name. [[H2143]]
