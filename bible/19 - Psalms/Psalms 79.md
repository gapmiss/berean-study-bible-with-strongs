### 1
A Psalm [[H4210]] of Asaph. [[H623]] The nations, [[H1471]] O God, [[H430]] have invaded [[H935]] Your inheritance; [[H5159]] they have defiled [[H2930]] Your holy [[H6944]] temple [[H1964]] [and] reduced [[H7760]] Jerusalem [[H3389]] to rubble. [[H5856]]

### 2
They have given [[H5414]] the corpses [[H5038]] of Your servants [[H5650]] as food [[H3978]] to the birds [[H5775]] of the air, [[H8064]] the flesh [[H1320]] of Your saints [[H2623]] to the beasts [[H2416]] of the earth. [[H776]]

### 3
They have poured out [[H8210]] their blood [[H1818]] like water [[H4325]] all around [[H5439]] Jerusalem, [[H3389]] and [there is] no one [[H369]] to bury [the dead]. [[H6912]]

### 4
We have become [[H1961]] a reproach [[H2781]] to our neighbors, [[H7934]] a scorn [[H3933]] and derision [[H7047]] to those around us. [[H5439]]

### 5
How long, [[H5704]] O LORD? [[H3068]] Will You be angry [[H599]] forever? [[H5331]] Will Your jealousy [[H7068]] burn [[H1197]] like [[H3644]] fire? [[H784]]

### 6
Pour out [[H8210]] Your wrath [[H2534]] on [[H413]] the nations [[H1471]] that [[H834]] do not [[H3808]] acknowledge You, [[H3045]] on [[H5921]] the kingdoms [[H4467]] that [[H834]] refuse [[H3808]] to call [[H7121]] on Your name, [[H8034]]

### 7
for [[H3588]] they have devoured [[H398]] Jacob [[H3290]] and laid waste [[H8074]] to his homeland. [[H5116]]

### 8
Do not hold [[H2142]] past [[H7223]] sins against us; [[H5771]] let Your compassion [[H7356]] come [[H6923]] quickly, [[H4118]] for [[H3588]] we are brought [[H1809]] low. [[H3966]]

### 9
Help us, [[H5826]] O God [[H430]] of our salvation, [[H3468]] for [[H5921]] the glory [[H3519]] of Your name; [[H8034]] deliver us [[H5337]] and atone [[H3722]] for [[H5921]] our sins, [[H2403]] for the sake [[H4616]] of Your name. [[H8034]]

### 10
Why [[H4100]] should the nations [[H1471]] ask, [[H559]] “Where [[H346]] is their God?” [[H430]] Before our eyes, [[H5869]] make known [[H3045]] among the nations [[H1471]] Your vengeance [[H5360]] for the bloodshed [[H1818]] of Your servants. [[H5650]]

### 11
May the groans [[H603]] of the captives [[H616]] reach You; [[H935]] by the strength [[H1433]] of Your arm [[H2220]] preserve [[H3498]] those condemned [[H1121]] to death. [[H8546]]

### 12
Pay back [[H7725]] into [[H413]] the laps [[H2436]] of our neighbors [[H7934]] sevenfold [[H7659]] the reproach [[H2781]] they hurled at You, [[H2778]] O Lord. [[H136]]

### 13
Then we [[H587]] Your people, [[H5971]] the sheep [[H6629]] of Your pasture, [[H4830]] will thank [[H3034]] You  forever; [[H5769]] from generation [[H1755]] to generation, [[H1755]] we will declare [[H5608]] Your praise. [[H8416]]
