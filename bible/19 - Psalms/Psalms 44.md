### 1
For the choirmaster. [[H5329]] A Maskil [[H4905]] of the sons [[H1121]] of Korah. [[H7141]] We have heard [[H8085]] with our ears, [[H241]] O God; [[H430]] our fathers [[H1]] have told us [[H5608]] the work [[H6467]] You did [[H6466]] in their days, [[H3117]] in days [[H3117]] of long ago. [[H6924]]

### 2
With Your hand [[H3027]] You [[H859]] drove out [[H3423]] the nations [[H1471]] and planted [our fathers] there; [[H5193]] You crushed [[H7489]] the peoples [[H3816]] and cast them out. [[H7971]]

### 3
For [[H3588]] it was not [[H3808]] by their sword [[H2719]] that they took [[H3423]] the land; [[H776]] their arm [[H2220]] did not [[H3808]] bring them victory; [[H3467]] it was [[H3588]] by Your right hand, [[H3225]] Your arm, [[H2220]] and the light [[H216]] of Your face; [[H6440]] for [[H3588]] You delighted in them. [[H7521]]

### 4
You [[H859]] are my King, [[H4428]] O God, [[H430]] who ordains [[H6680]] victories [[H3444]] for Jacob. [[H3290]]

### 5
Through You  we repel [[H5055]] our foes; [[H6862]] through Your name [[H8034]] we trample [[H947]] our enemies. [[H6965]]

### 6
For [[H3588]] I do not [[H3808]] trust [[H982]] in my bow, [[H7198]] nor does my sword [[H2719]] deliver me. [[H3467]]

### 7
But [[H3588]] You give us victory [[H3467]] over our enemies; [[H6862]] You put those who hate us [[H8130]] to shame. [[H954]]

### 8
In God [[H430]] we have boasted [[H1984]] all day long, [[H3605]] and Your name [[H8034]] we will praise [[H3034]] forever. [[H5769]] Selah [[H5542]]

### 9
But [[H637]] You have rejected [[H2186]] and humbled us; [[H3637]] You no longer [[H3808]] go forth [[H3318]] with our armies. [[H6635]]

### 10
You have made us retreat [[H7725]] from [[H4480]] the foe, [[H6862]] and those who hate us [[H8130]] have plundered us. [[H8154]]

### 11
You have given us up [[H5414]] as sheep [[H6629]] to be devoured; [[H3978]] You have scattered us [[H2219]] among the nations. [[H1471]]

### 12
You sell [[H4376]] Your people [[H5971]] for nothing; [[H3808]] no [[H3808]] profit [[H1952]] do You gain [[H7235]] from their sale. [[H4242]]

### 13
You have made us [[H7760]] a reproach [[H2781]] to our neighbors, [[H7934]] a mockery [[H3933]] and derision [[H7047]] to those around us. [[H5439]]

### 14
You have made us [[H7760]] a byword [[H4912]] among the nations, [[H1471]] a laughingstock [[H4493]] among [[H3816]] the peoples. [[H3816]]

### 15
All day long [[H3605]] my disgrace [[H3639]] is before me [[H5048]] and shame [[H1322]] has covered [[H3680]] my face, [[H6440]]

### 16
at the voice [[H6963]] of the scorner [[H2778]] and reviler, [[H1442]] because of [[H6440]] the enemy, [[H341]] bent on revenge. [[H5358]]

### 17
All [[H3605]] this [[H2063]] has come upon us, [[H935]] though we have not [[H3808]] forgotten You [[H7911]] or betrayed [[H8266]] Your covenant. [[H1285]]

### 18
Our hearts [[H3820]] have not [[H3808]] turned back; [[H5472]] our steps [[H838]] have not strayed [[H5186]] from [[H4480]] Your path. [[H734]]

### 19
But [[H3588]] You have crushed us [[H1794]] in the lair [[H4725]] of jackals; [[H8577]] You have covered [[H3680]] us with deepest darkness. [[H6757]]

### 20
If [[H518]] we had forgotten [[H7911]] the name [[H8034]] of our God [[H430]] or spread out [[H6566]] our hands [[H3709]] to a foreign [[H2114]] god, [[H410]]

### 21
would not [[H3808]] God [[H430]] have discovered, [[H2063]] since [[H3588]] He [[H1931]] knows [[H3045]] the secrets [[H8587]] of the heart? [[H3820]]

### 22
Yet [[H3588]] for Your sake [[H5921]] we face death [[H2026]] all day long; [[H3605]] we are considered [[H2803]] as sheep [[H6629]] to be slaughtered. [[H2878]]

### 23
Wake up, [[H5782]] O Lord! [[H136]] Why [[H4100]] are You sleeping? [[H3462]] Arise! [[H6974]] Do not [[H408]] reject us forever. [[H2186]]

### 24
Why [[H4100]] do You hide [[H5641]] Your face [[H6440]] and forget [[H7911]] our misery [[H6040]] and oppression? [[H3906]]

### 25
For [[H3588]] our soul [[H5315]] has sunk [[H7743]] to the dust; [[H6083]] our bodies [[H990]] cling [[H1692]] to the earth. [[H776]]

### 26
Rise up, [[H6965]] be our help! [[H5833]] Redeem us [[H6299]] on account of [[H4616]] Your loving devotion. [[H2617]]
