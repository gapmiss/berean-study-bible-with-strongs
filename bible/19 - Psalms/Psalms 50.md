###### 1
A Psalm [[H4210]] of Asaph. [[H623]] The Mighty One, [[H410]] God [[H430]] the LORD, [[H3068]] speaks [[H1696]] and summons [[H7121]] the earth [[H776]] from the rising [[H4217]] to [[H5704]] the setting [[H3996]] of the sun. [[H8121]]

###### 2
From Zion, [[H6726]] perfect [[H4359]] in beauty, [[H3308]] God [[H430]] shines forth. [[H3313]]

###### 3
Our God [[H430]] comes [[H935]] and will not [[H408]] be silent! [[H2790]] Consuming [[H398]] fire [[H784]] precedes Him, [[H6440]] and a tempest [[H8175]] rages around Him. [[H5439]]

###### 4
He summons [[H7121]] the heavens [[H8064]] above, [[H5920]] and the earth, [[H776]] that He may judge [[H1777]] His people: [[H5971]]

###### 5
“Gather [[H622]] to Me  My saints, [[H2623]] who made [[H3772]] a covenant [[H1285]] with Me [[H5921]] by sacrifice.” [[H2077]]

###### 6
And the heavens [[H8064]] proclaim [[H5046]] His righteousness, [[H6664]] for [[H3588]] God [[H430]] Himself [[H1931]] is Judge. [[H8199]] Selah [[H5542]]

###### 7
“Hear, [[H8085]] O My people, [[H5971]] and I will speak, [[H1696]] O Israel, [[H3478]] and I will testify [[H5749]] against you:  I [[H595]] am God, [[H430]] your God. [[H430]]

###### 8
I do not [[H3808]] rebuke [[H3198]] you for [[H5921]] your sacrifices, [[H2077]] and your burnt offerings [[H5930]] are ever [[H8548]] before Me. [[H5048]]

###### 9
I have no [[H3808]] need [[H3947]] for a bull [[H6499]] from your stall [[H1004]] or goats [[H6260]] from your pens, [[H4356]]

###### 10
for [[H3588]] every [[H3605]] beast [[H2416]] of the forest [[H3293]] is Mine—  the cattle [[H929]] on a thousand [[H505]] hills. [[H2042]]

###### 11
I know [[H3045]] every [[H3605]] bird [[H5775]] in the mountains, [[H2022]] and the creatures [[H2123]] of the field [[H7704]] [are] Mine. [[H5978]]

###### 12
If [[H518]] I were hungry, [[H7456]] I would not [[H3808]] tell you, [[H559]] for [[H3588]] the world [[H8398]] is Mine,  and the fullness thereof. [[H4393]]

###### 13
Do I eat [[H398]] the flesh [[H1320]] of bulls, [[H47]] or drink [[H8354]] the blood [[H1818]] of goats? [[H6260]]

###### 14
Sacrifice [[H2076]] a thank offering [[H8426]] to God, [[H430]] and fulfill [[H7999]] your vows [[H5088]] to the Most High. [[H5945]]

###### 15
Call upon Me [[H7121]] in the day [[H3117]] of trouble; [[H6869]] I will deliver you, [[H2502]] and you will honor Me.” [[H3513]]

###### 16
To the wicked, however, [[H7563]] God [[H430]] says, [[H559]] “What right [[H4100]] have you  to recite [[H5608]] My statutes [[H2706]] and to bear [[H5375]] My covenant [[H1285]] on [[H5921]] your lips? [[H6310]]

###### 17
For you [[H859]] hate [[H8130]] My instruction [[H4148]] and cast [[H7993]] My words [[H1697]] behind you. [[H310]]

###### 18
When [[H518]] you see [[H7200]] a thief, [[H1590]] you befriend [[H7521]] him, [[H5973]] and throw in your lot [[H2506]] with [[H5973]] adulterers. [[H5003]]

###### 19
You unleash [[H7971]] your mouth [[H6310]] for evil [[H7451]] and unharness [[H6775]] your tongue [[H3956]] for deceit. [[H4820]]

###### 20
You sit [[H3427]] and malign [[H1696]] your brother, [[H251]] you [[H5414]] slander [[H1848]] your own mother’s [[H517]] son. [[H1121]]

###### 21
You have done [[H6213]] these things, [[H428]] and I kept silent; [[H2790]] you thought [[H1819]] I was [[H1961]] just like you. [[H3644]] But I Myself will rebuke you [[H3198]] and accuse you [[H6186]] to your face. [[H5869]]

###### 22
Now [[H4994]] consider [[H995]] this, [[H2063]] you who forget [[H7911]] God, [[H433]] lest [[H6435]] I tear you to pieces, [[H2963]] with no one [[H369]] to rescue you: [[H5337]]

###### 23
He who sacrifices [[H2076]] a thank offering [[H8426]] honors Me, [[H3513]] and to him who rights [[H7760]] [his] way, [[H1870]] I will show [[H7200]] the salvation [[H3468]] of God.” [[H430]]
