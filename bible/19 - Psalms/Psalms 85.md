### 1
For the choirmaster. [[H5329]] A Psalm [[H4210]] of the sons [[H1121]] of Korah. [[H7141]] You showed favor [[H7521]] to Your land, [[H776]] O LORD; [[H3068]] You restored [[H7725]] Jacob [[H3290]] from captivity. [[H7622]]

### 2
You forgave [[H5375]] the iniquity [[H5771]] of Your people; [[H5971]] You covered [[H3680]] all [[H3605]] their sin. [[H2403]] Selah [[H5542]]

### 3
You withheld [[H622]] all [[H3605]] Your fury; [[H5678]] You turned from [[H7725]] Your burning anger. [[H2740]]

### 4
Restore us, [[H7725]] O God [[H430]] of our salvation, [[H3468]] and put away [[H6565]] Your displeasure [[H3708]] toward us. [[H5973]]

### 5
Will You be angry [[H599]] with us  forever? [[H5769]] Will You draw out [[H4900]] Your anger [[H639]] to all [[H1755]] generations? [[H1755]]

### 6
Will You [[H859]] not [[H3808]] revive [[H2421]] us again, [[H7725]] that Your people [[H5971]] may rejoice [[H8055]] in You? 

### 7
Show [[H7200]] us Your loving devotion, [[H2617]] O LORD, [[H3068]] and grant [[H5414]] us  Your salvation. [[H3468]]

### 8
I will listen [[H8085]] to what [[H4100]] God [[H410]] the LORD [[H3068]] will say; [[H1696]] for [[H3588]] He will surely speak [[H1696]] peace [[H7965]] to [[H413]] His people [[H5971]] and [[H413]] His saints; [[H2623]] He will not [[H408]] let them return [[H7725]] to folly. [[H3690]]

### 9
Surely [[H389]] His salvation [[H3468]] [is] near [[H7138]] to those who fear Him, [[H3373]] that His glory [[H3519]] may dwell [[H7931]] in our land. [[H776]]

### 10
Loving devotion [[H2617]] and truth [[H571]] have joined together; [[H6298]] righteousness [[H6664]] and peace [[H7965]] have kissed. [[H5401]]

### 11
Truth [[H571]] sprouts [[H6779]] from the earth, [[H776]] and righteousness [[H6664]] looks down [[H8259]] from heaven. [[H8064]]

### 12
The LORD [[H3068]] will indeed [[H1571]] provide what is good, [[H5414]] and our land [[H776]] will yield [[H5414]] its increase. [[H2981]]

### 13
Righteousness [[H6664]] will go [[H1980]] before Him [[H6440]] to prepare [[H7760]] the way [[H1870]] for His steps. [[H6471]]
