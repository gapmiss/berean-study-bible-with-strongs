### 1
A Song [[H7892]] of Ascents. [[H4609]] O LORD, [[H3068]] remember [[H2142]] on behalf [[H854]] of David [[H1732]] all [[H3605]] the hardships he endured, [[H6031]]

### 2
how [[H834]] he swore an oath [[H7650]] to the LORD, [[H3068]] [and] vowed [[H5087]] to the Mighty [[H46]] One of Jacob: [[H3290]]

### 3
“I will not [[H518]] enter [[H935]] my house [[H1004]] or [[H518]] get [[H5927]] into [[H5921]] my bed, [[H3326]]

### 4
I will not [[H518]] give [[H5414]] sleep [[H8153]] to my eyes [[H5869]] [or] slumber [[H8572]] to my eyelids, [[H6079]]

### 5
until [[H5704]] I find [[H4672]] a place [[H4725]] for the LORD, [[H3068]] a dwelling [[H4908]] for the Mighty [[H46]] One of Jacob.” [[H3290]]

### 6
We heard [[H8085]] [the ark] was in Ephrathah; [[H672]] we found [[H4672]] it in the fields [[H7704]] of Jaar. [[H3293]]

### 7
Let us go [[H935]] to His dwelling place; [[H4908]] let us worship [[H7812]] at His footstool. [[H1916]]

### 8
Arise, [[H6965]] O LORD, [[H3068]] to Your resting place, [[H4496]] You [[H859]] and the ark [[H727]] of Your strength. [[H5797]]

### 9
May Your priests [[H3548]] be clothed [[H3847]] with righteousness, [[H6664]] and Your saints [[H2623]] shout for joy. [[H7442]]

### 10
For the sake [[H5668]] of Your servant [[H5650]] David, [[H1732]] do not [[H408]] reject [[H7725]] Your anointed one. [[H4899]]

### 11
The LORD [[H3068]] swore an oath [[H7650]] to David, [[H1732]] a promise He will not [[H3808]] revoke: [[H7725]] “One of your descendants [[H6529]] I will set [[H7896]] upon your throne. [[H3678]]

### 12
If [[H518]] your sons [[H1121]] keep [[H8104]] My covenant [[H1285]] and the testimony [[H5713]] I will teach them, [[H3925]] then their sons [[H1121]] will also [[H1571]] sit [[H3427]] on your throne [[H3678]] forever [[H5703]] and ever.” [[H5703]]

### 13
For [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] has chosen [[H977]] Zion; [[H6726]] He has desired [[H183]] it for His home: [[H4186]]

### 14
“This [[H2063]] is My resting place [[H4496]] forever [[H5703]] and ever; [[H5703]] here [[H6311]] I will dwell, [[H3427]] for [[H3588]] I have desired [this home]. [[H183]]

### 15
I will bless her [[H1288]] with abundant [[H1288]] provisions; [[H6718]] I will satisfy [[H7646]] her poor [[H34]] with bread. [[H3899]]

### 16
I will clothe [[H3847]] her priests [[H3548]] with salvation, [[H3468]] and her saints [[H2623]] will sing out in joy. [[H7442]]

### 17
There [[H8033]] I will make a horn [[H7161]] grow [[H6779]] for David; [[H1732]] I have prepared [[H6186]] a lamp [[H5216]] for My anointed one. [[H4899]]

### 18
I will clothe [[H3847]] his enemies [[H341]] with shame, [[H1322]] but the crown [[H5145]] upon him [[H5921]] will gleam.” [[H6692]]
