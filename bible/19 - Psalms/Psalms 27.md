### 1
Of David. [[H1732]] The LORD [[H3068]] is my light [[H216]] and my salvation— [[H3468]] whom [[H4310]] shall I fear? [[H3372]] The LORD [[H3068]] is the stronghold [[H4581]] of my life— [[H2416]] whom [[H4310]] shall I dread? [[H6342]]

### 2
When the wicked [[H7489]] came [[H7126]] upon me [[H5921]] to devour [[H398]] my flesh, [[H1320]] my enemies [[H6862]] and foes [[H341]] stumbled [[H3782]] and fell. [[H5307]]

### 3
Though [[H518]] an army [[H4264]] encamps [[H2583]] around me, [[H5921]] my heart [[H3820]] {will} not [[H3808]] fear; [[H3372]] though [[H518]] a war [[H4421]] breaks out [[H6965]] against me, [[H5921]] I [[H589]] will keep my trust. [[H982]]

### 4
One thing [[H259]] I have asked [[H7592]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] this is what I desire: [[H1245]] to dwell [[H3427]] in the house [[H1004]] of the LORD [[H3068]] all [[H3605]] the days [[H3117]] of my life, [[H2416]] to gaze [[H2372]] on the beauty [[H5278]] of the LORD [[H3068]] and seek Him [[H1239]] in His temple. [[H1964]]

### 5
For [[H3588]] in the day [[H3117]] of trouble [[H7451]] He will hide [[H6845]] me in His shelter; [[H5520]] He will conceal me [[H5641]] under the cover [[H5643]] of His tent; [[H168]] He will set me high [[H7311]] upon a rock. [[H6697]]

### 6
Then [[H6258]] my head [[H7218]] will be held high [[H7311]] above [[H5921]] my enemies [[H341]] around me. [[H5439]] At His tabernacle [[H168]] I will offer [[H2076]] sacrifices [[H2077]] with shouts of joy; [[H8643]] I will sing [[H7891]] and make music [[H2167]] to the LORD. [[H3068]]

### 7
Hear, [[H8085]] O LORD, [[H3068]] my voice [[H6963]] when I call; [[H7121]] be merciful [[H2603]] and answer me. [[H6030]]

### 8
My heart [[H3820]] said, [[H559]] “Seek [[H1245]] His face.” [[H6440]] Your face, [[H6440]] O LORD, [[H3068]] I will seek. [[H1245]]

### 9
Hide [[H5641]] not [[H408]] Your face [[H6440]] from me, [[H4480]] nor [[H408]] turn away [[H5186]] Your servant [[H5650]] in anger. [[H639]] You have been [[H1961]] my helper; [[H5833]] do not [[H408]] leave me [[H5203]] or [[H408]] forsake me, [[H5800]] O God [[H430]] of my salvation. [[H3468]]

### 10
Though [[H3588]] my father [[H1]] and mother [[H517]] forsake me, [[H5800]] the LORD [[H3068]] will receive me. [[H622]]

### 11
Teach me [[H3384]] Your way, [[H1870]] O LORD, [[H3068]] and lead [[H5148]] me on a level [[H4334]] path, [[H734]] because of [[H4616]] my oppressors. [[H8324]]

### 12
Do not [[H408]] hand me over [[H5414]] to the will [[H5315]] of my foes, [[H6862]] for [[H3588]] FALSE [[H8267]] witnesses [[H5707]] rise up [[H6965]] against me,  breathing out [[H3307]] violence. [[H2555]]

### 13
Still [[H3884]] I am certain [[H539]] to see [[H7200]] the goodness [[H2898]] of the LORD [[H3068]] in the land [[H776]] of the living. [[H2416]]

### 14
Wait patiently [[H6960]] for [[H413]] the LORD; [[H3068]] be strong [[H2388]] and courageous. [[H553]] Wait patiently [[H6960]] for [[H413]] the LORD. [[H3068]]
