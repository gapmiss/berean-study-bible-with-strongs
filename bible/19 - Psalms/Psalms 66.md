###### 1
For the choirmaster. [[H5329]] A Song. [[H7892]] A Psalm. [[H4210]] Make a joyful noise [[H7321]] to God, [[H430]] all [[H3605]] the earth! [[H776]]

###### 2
Sing [[H2167]] the glory [[H3519]] of His name; [[H8034]] make [[H7760]] His praise [[H8416]] glorious. [[H3519]]

###### 3
Say [[H559]] to God, [[H430]] “How [[H4100]] awesome [[H3372]] are Your deeds! [[H4639]] So great is Your [[H7230]] power [[H5797]] that Your enemies [[H341]] cower before You. [[H3584]]

###### 4
All [[H3605]] the earth [[H776]] bows down [[H7812]] to You;  they sing praise [[H2167]] to You;  they sing praise [[H2167]] to Your name.” [[H8034]] Selah [[H5542]]

###### 5
Come [[H1980]] and see [[H7200]] the works [[H4659]] of God; [[H430]] how awesome [[H3372]] are His deeds [[H5949]] toward [[H5921]] mankind. [[H120]]

###### 6
He turned [[H2015]] the sea [[H3220]] into dry land; [[H3004]] they passed through [[H5674]] the waters [[H5104]] on foot; [[H7272]] there [[H8033]] we rejoiced [[H8055]] in Him. 

###### 7
He rules [[H4910]] forever [[H5769]] by His power; [[H1369]] His eyes [[H5869]] watch [[H6822]] the nations. [[H1471]] Do not let [[H408]] the rebellious [[H5637]] exalt themselves. [[H7311]] Selah [[H5542]]

###### 8
Praise [[H1288]] our God, [[H430]] O peoples; [[H5971]] let the sound [[H6963]] of His praise [[H8416]] be heard. [[H8085]]

###### 9
He preserves [[H7760]] our [[H5315]] lives [[H2416]] and keeps [[H3808]] our feet [[H7272]] from slipping. [[H4132]]

###### 10
For [[H3588]] You, O God, [[H430]] have tested us; [[H974]] You have refined us [[H6884]] like silver. [[H3701]]

###### 11
You led us [[H935]] into the net; [[H4686]] You laid [[H7760]] burdens [[H4157]] on our backs. [[H4975]]

###### 12
You let men [[H582]] ride [[H7392]] over our heads; [[H7218]] we went [[H935]] through fire [[H784]] and water, [[H4325]] but You brought us [[H3318]] into abundance. [[H7310]]

###### 13
I will enter [[H935]] Your house [[H1004]] with burnt offerings; [[H5930]] I will fulfill [[H7999]] my vows [[H5088]] to You— 

###### 14
[the vows] that [[H834]] my lips [[H8193]] promised [[H6475]] and my mouth [[H6310]] spoke [[H1696]] in my distress. [[H6862]]

###### 15
I will offer [[H5927]] You  fatlings [[H4220]] as burnt offerings, [[H5930]] with [[H5973]] the fragrant smoke [[H7004]] of rams; [[H352]] I will offer [[H6213]] bulls [[H1241]] and [[H5973]] goats. [[H6260]] Selah [[H5542]]

###### 16
Come [[H1980]] and listen, [[H8085]] all you [[H3605]] who fear [[H3373]] God, [[H430]] and I will declare [[H5608]] what [[H834]] He has done [[H6213]] for me. [[H5315]]

###### 17
I cried out [[H7121]] to Him [[H413]] with my mouth, [[H6310]] and His praise [[H7318]] was on [[H8478]] my tongue. [[H3956]]

###### 18
If [[H518]] I had cherished [[H7200]] iniquity [[H205]] in my heart, [[H3820]] the Lord [[H136]] would not [[H3808]] have listened. [[H8085]]

###### 19
But God [[H430]] has surely [[H403]] heard; [[H8085]] He has attended [[H7181]] to the sound [[H6963]] of my prayer. [[H8605]]

###### 20
Blessed [[H1288]] [be] God, [[H430]] who [[H834]] has not [[H3808]] rejected [[H5493]] my prayer [[H8605]] or withheld from me [[H854]] His loving devotion! [[H2617]]
