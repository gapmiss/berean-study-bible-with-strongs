### 1
A prayer [[H8605]] of one who is afflicted, [[H6041]] when [[H3588]] he grows faint [[H5848]] and pours out [[H8210]] his lament [[H7879]] before [[H6440]] the LORD. [[H3068]] Hear [[H8085]] my prayer, [[H8605]] O LORD; [[H3068]] let my cry for help [[H7775]] come [[H935]] before You. [[H413]]

### 2
Do not [[H408]] hide [[H5641]] Your face [[H6440]] from me [[H4480]] in the day [[H3117]] of my distress. [[H6862]] Incline [[H5186]] Your ear [[H241]] to me; [[H413]] answer [[H6030]] me quickly [[H4118]] when [[H3117]] I call. [[H7121]]

### 3
For [[H3588]] my days [[H3117]] vanish [[H3615]] like smoke, [[H6227]] and my bones [[H6106]] burn [[H2787]] like glowing embers. [[H4168]]

### 4
My heart [[H3820]] is afflicted, [[H5221]] and withered [[H3001]] like grass; [[H6212]] I even [[H3588]] forget [[H7911]] to eat [[H398]] my bread. [[H3899]]

### 5
Through my loud [[H6963]] groaning, [[H585]] my flesh [[H1320]] clings [[H1692]] to my bones. [[H6106]]

### 6
I am [[H1961]] like [[H1819]] a desert [[H4057]] owl, [[H6893]] like an owl [[H3563]] among the ruins. [[H2723]]

### 7
I lie awake; [[H8245]] I am [[H1961]] like a lone [[H909]] bird [[H6833]] on [[H5921]] a housetop. [[H1406]]

### 8
All [[H3605]] day long [[H3117]] my enemies [[H341]] taunt me; [[H2778]] they ridicule [[H1984]] and curse me. [[H7650]]

### 9
For [[H3588]] I have eaten [[H398]] ashes [[H665]] like bread [[H3899]] and mixed [[H4537]] my drink [[H8249]] with tears, [[H1065]]

### 10
because of [[H6440]] Your indignation [[H2195]] and wrath; [[H7110]] for [[H3588]] You have picked me up [[H5375]] and cast me aside. [[H7993]]

### 11
My days [[H3117]] are like lengthening [[H5186]] shadows, [[H6738]] and I [[H589]] wither away [[H3001]] like grass. [[H6212]]

### 12
But You, [[H859]] O LORD, [[H3068]] sit enthroned [[H3427]] forever; [[H5769]] Your renown endures [[H2143]] to all generations. [[H1755]]

### 13
You [[H859]] will rise up [[H6965]] and have compassion [[H7355]] on Zion, [[H6726]] for [[H3588]] it is time [[H6256]] to show her favor— [[H2603]] the appointed time [[H4150]] has come. [[H935]]

### 14
For [[H3588]] Your servants [[H5650]] delight [[H7521]] in her [[H853]] stones [[H68]] and [[H853]] take pity [[H2603]] on her dust. [[H6083]]

### 15
So the nations [[H1471]] will fear [[H3372]] the name [[H8034]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] and all [[H3605]] the kings [[H4428]] of the earth [[H776]] [will fear] Your glory, [[H3519]]

### 16
for [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] will rebuild [[H1129]] Zion; [[H6726]] He has appeared [[H7200]] in His glory. [[H3519]]

### 17
He will turn [[H6437]] toward [[H413]] the prayer [[H8605]] of the destitute; [[H6199]] He will not [[H3808]] despise [[H959]] their prayer. [[H8605]]

### 18
Let this [[H2063]] be written [[H3789]] for the generation [[H1755]] to come, [[H314]] that a people [[H5971]] not yet created [[H1254]] may praise [[H1984]] the LORD. [[H3050]]

### 19
For [[H3588]] He looked down [[H8259]] from the heights [[H4791]] of His sanctuary; [[H6944]] the LORD [[H3068]] gazed out [[H5027]] from heaven [[H8064]] to [[H413]] earth, [[H776]]

### 20
to hear [[H8085]] a prisoner’s [[H615]] groaning, [[H603]] to release [[H6605]] those condemned [[H1121]] to death, [[H8546]]

### 21
that they may proclaim [[H5608]] the name [[H8034]] of the LORD [[H3068]] in Zion [[H6726]] and His praise [[H8416]] in Jerusalem, [[H3389]]

### 22
when peoples [[H5971]] and kingdoms [[H4467]] assemble [[H6908]] to serve [[H5647]] the LORD. [[H3068]]

### 23
He has broken [[H6031]] my strength [[H3581]] on the way; [[H1870]] He has shortened [[H7114]] my days. [[H3117]]

### 24
I say: [[H559]] “O my God, [[H410]] do not [[H408]] take me [[H5927]] in the midst [[H2677]] of my days! [[H3117]] Your years [[H8141]] [go on] through all generations. [[H1755]]

### 25
In the beginning [[H6440]] You laid the foundations [[H3245]] of the earth, [[H776]] and the heavens [[H8064]] are the work [[H4639]] of Your hands. [[H3027]]

### 26
They [[H1992]] will perish, [[H6]] but You [[H859]] remain; [[H5975]] they will all [[H3605]] wear out [[H1086]] like a garment. [[H899]] Like clothing [[H3830]] You will change them, [[H2498]] and they will be passed on. [[H2498]]

### 27
But You [[H859]] remain the same, [[H1931]] and Your years [[H8141]] will never [[H3808]] end. [[H8552]]

### 28
The children [[H1121]] of Your servants [[H5650]] will dwell securely, [[H7931]] and their descendants [[H2233]] will be established [[H3559]] before You.” [[H6440]]
