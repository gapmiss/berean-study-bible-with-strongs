###### 1
A Song. [[H7892]] A Psalm [[H4210]] of the sons [[H1121]] of Korah. [[H7141]] For the choirmaster. [[H5329]] According to [[H5921]] Mahalath [[H4257]] Leannoth. [[H6031]] A Maskil [[H4905]] of Heman [[H1968]] the Ezrahite. [[H250]] O LORD, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of my salvation, [[H3444]] day [[H3117]] and night [[H3915]] I cry out [[H6817]] before You. [[H5048]]

###### 2
May my prayer [[H8605]] come [[H935]] before You; [[H6440]] incline [[H5186]] Your ear [[H241]] to my cry. [[H7440]]

###### 3
For [[H3588]] my soul [[H5315]] is full [[H7646]] of troubles, [[H7451]] and my life [[H2416]] draws near [[H5060]] to Sheol. [[H7585]]

###### 4
I am counted [[H2803]] among [[H5973]] those descending [[H3381]] to the pit. [[H953]] I am [[H1961]] like a man [[H1397]] without [[H369]] strength. [[H353]]

###### 5
I am forsaken [[H2670]] among the dead, [[H4191]] like [[H3644]] the slain [[H2491]] who lie [[H7901]] in the grave, [[H6913]] whom [[H834]] You [[H3808]] remember [[H2142]] no more, [[H5750]] who [[H1992]] are cut off [[H1504]] from Your care. [[H3027]]

###### 6
You have laid me [[H7896]] in the lowest [[H8482]] pit, [[H953]] in the darkest [[H4285]] of the depths. [[H4688]]

###### 7
Your wrath [[H2534]] weighs heavily [[H5564]] upon me; [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] Your waves [[H4867]] have submerged [me]. [[H6031]] Selah [[H5542]]

###### 8
You have removed [[H7368]] my friends [[H3045]] from me; [[H4480]] You have made me [[H7896]] repulsive [[H8441]] to them;  I am confined [[H3607]] and cannot [[H3808]] escape. [[H3318]]

###### 9
My eyes [[H5869]] grow dim [[H1669]] with [[H4480]] grief. [[H6040]] I call to You [[H7121]] daily, [[H3605]] O LORD; [[H3068]] I spread out [[H7849]] my hands [[H3709]] to You. [[H413]]

###### 10
Do You work [[H6213]] wonders [[H6382]] for the dead? [[H4191]] Do departed spirits [[H7496]] rise up [[H6965]] to praise You? [[H3034]] Selah [[H5542]]

###### 11
Can Your loving devotion [[H2617]] be proclaimed [[H5608]] in the grave, [[H6913]] Your faithfulness [[H530]] in Abaddon? [[H11]]

###### 12
Will Your wonders [[H6382]] be known [[H3045]] in the darkness, [[H2822]] or Your righteousness [[H6666]] in the land [[H776]] of oblivion? [[H5388]]

###### 13
But [[H589]] to You, [[H413]] O LORD, [[H3068]] I cry for help; [[H7768]] in the morning [[H1242]] my prayer [[H8605]] comes before You. [[H6923]]

###### 14
Why, [[H4100]] O LORD, [[H3068]] do You reject [[H2186]] me? [[H5315]] Why do You hide [[H5641]] Your face [[H6440]] from me? [[H4480]]

###### 15
From my youth [[H5290]] I [was] [[H589]] afflicted [[H6041]] and near death. [[H1478]] I suffer [[H5375]] Your terrors; [[H367]] I am in despair. [[H6323]]

###### 16
Your wrath [[H2740]] has swept [[H5674]] over me; [[H5921]] Your terrors [[H1161]] have destroyed me. [[H6789]]

###### 17
All [[H3605]] day long [[H3117]] they engulf me [[H5437]] like water; [[H4325]] they enclose me [[H5362]] on [[H5921]] every side. [[H3162]]

###### 18
You have removed [[H7368]] my [[H4480]] beloved [[H157]] and my friend; [[H7453]] darkness [[H4285]] is my closest companion. [[H3045]]
