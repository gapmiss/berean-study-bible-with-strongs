###### 1
When Israel [[H3478]] departed [[H3318]] from Egypt, [[H4714]] the house [[H1004]] of Jacob [[H3290]] from a people [[H5971]] of foreign tongue, [[H3937]]

###### 2
Judah [[H3063]] became [[H1961]] [God’s] sanctuary, [[H6944]] Israel [[H3478]] His dominion. [[H4475]]

###### 3
The sea [[H3220]] observed [[H7200]] and fled; [[H5127]] the Jordan [[H3383]] turned [[H5437]] back; [[H268]]

###### 4
the mountains [[H2022]] skipped [[H7540]] like rams, [[H352]] the hills [[H1389]] like lambs. [[H1121]]

###### 5
Why was it, [[H4100]] O sea, [[H3220]] that [[H3588]] you fled, [[H5127]] O Jordan, [[H3383]] that you turned [[H5437]] back, [[H268]]

###### 6
O mountains, [[H2022]] that you skipped [[H7540]] like rams, [[H352]] O hills, [[H1389]] like lambs? [[H1121]]

###### 7
Tremble, [[H2342]] O earth, [[H776]] at the presence [[H6440]] of the Lord, [[H113]] at the presence [[H6440]] of the God [[H433]] of Jacob, [[H3290]]

###### 8
who turned [[H2015]] the rock [[H6697]] into a pool, [[H98]] the flint [[H2496]] into a fountain [[H4599]] of water. [[H4325]]
