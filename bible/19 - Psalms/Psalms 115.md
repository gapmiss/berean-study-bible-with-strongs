### 1
Not [[H3808]] to us,  O LORD, [[H3068]] not to us, [[H3808]] but [[H3588]] to Your name [[H8034]] be [[H5414]] the glory, [[H3519]] because of [[H5921]] Your loving devotion, [[H2617]] because [[H5921]] of Your faithfulness. [[H571]]

### 2
Why [[H4100]] should the nations [[H1471]] say, [[H559]] “Where [[H346]] is their God?” [[H430]]

### 3
Our God [[H430]] is in heaven [[H8064]] and does [[H6213]] as [[H3605]] He pleases. [[H2654]]

### 4
Their idols [[H6091]] are silver [[H3701]] and gold, [[H2091]] made [[H4639]] by the hands [[H3027]] of men. [[H120]]

### 5
They have mouths, [[H6310]] but cannot [[H3808]] speak; [[H1696]] they have eyes, [[H5869]] but cannot [[H3808]] see; [[H7200]]

### 6
they have ears, [[H241]] but cannot [[H3808]] hear; [[H8085]] they have noses, [[H639]] but cannot [[H3808]] smell; [[H7306]]

### 7
they have hands, [[H3027]] but cannot [[H3808]] feel; [[H4184]] they have feet, [[H7272]] but cannot [[H3808]] walk. [[H1980]] They cannot [[H3808]] utter a sound [[H1897]] with their throats. [[H1627]]

### 8
Those who make them [[H6213]] will be [[H1961]] like them, [[H3644]] as will all [[H3605]] who [[H834]] trust [[H982]] in them. 

### 9
O Israel, [[H3478]] trust [[H982]] in the LORD! [[H3068]] He [[H1931]] is their help [[H5828]] and shield. [[H4043]]

### 10
O house [[H1004]] of Aaron, [[H175]] trust [[H982]] in the LORD! [[H3068]] He [[H1931]] is their help [[H5828]] and shield. [[H4043]]

### 11
You who fear [[H3373]] the LORD, [[H3068]] trust [[H982]] in the LORD! [[H3068]] He [[H1931]] is their help [[H5828]] and shield. [[H4043]]

### 12
The LORD [[H3068]] is mindful of us; [[H2142]] He will bless us. [[H1288]] He will bless [[H1288]] the house [[H1004]] of Israel; [[H3478]] He will bless [[H1288]] the house [[H1004]] of Aaron; [[H175]]

### 13
He will bless [[H1288]] those who fear [[H3373]] the LORD— [[H3068]] small [[H6996]] and [[H5973]] great alike. [[H1419]]

### 14
May the LORD [[H3068]] give you increase, [[H3254]] both you [[H5921]] and [[H5921]] your children. [[H1121]]

### 15
May you [[H859]] be blessed [[H1288]] by the LORD, [[H3068]] the Maker [[H6213]] of heaven [[H8064]] and earth. [[H776]]

### 16
The highest heavens [[H8064]] belong to the LORD, [[H3068]] but the earth [[H776]] He has given [[H5414]] to mankind. [[H120]]

### 17
It is not [[H3808]] the dead [[H4191]] who praise [[H1984]] the LORD, [[H3050]] nor [[H3808]] any [[H3605]] who descend [[H3381]] into silence. [[H1745]]

### 18
But it is we [[H587]] who will bless [[H1288]] the LORD, [[H3050]] both now [[H6258]] and forevermore. [[H5704]] Hallelujah! [[H1984]]
