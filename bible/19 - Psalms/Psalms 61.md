###### 1
For the choirmaster. [[H5329]] With [[H5921]] stringed instruments. [[H5058]] Of David. [[H1732]] Hear [[H8085]] my cry, [[H7440]] O God, [[H430]] attend [[H7181]] to my prayer. [[H8605]]

###### 2
From the ends [[H7097]] of the earth [[H776]] I call out [[H7121]] to [[H413]] You [[H4480]] whenever my heart [[H3820]] is faint. [[H5848]] Lead me [[H5148]] to the rock [[H6697]] [that] is higher than I. [[H7311]]

###### 3
For [[H3588]] You have been [[H1961]] my refuge, [[H4268]] a tower [[H4026]] of strength [[H5797]] against [[H6440]] the enemy. [[H341]]

###### 4
Let me dwell [[H1481]] in Your tent [[H168]] forever [[H5769]] and take refuge [[H2620]] in the shelter [[H5643]] of Your wings. [[H3671]] Selah [[H5542]]

###### 5
For [[H3588]] You [[H859]] have heard [[H8085]] my vows, [[H5088]] O God; [[H430]] You have given me [[H5414]] the inheritance [[H3425]] reserved for those who fear [[H3373]] Your name. [[H8034]]

###### 6
Increase [[H3254]] the days [[H3117]] of [[H5921]] the king’s [[H4428]] life; [[H3117]] may his years [[H8141]] span many generations. [[H1755]]

###### 7
May he sit enthroned [[H3427]] in God’s [[H430]] presence [[H6440]] forever; [[H5769]] appoint [[H4487]] Your loving devotion [[H2617]] and Your faithfulness [[H571]] to guard him. [[H5341]]

###### 8
Then [[H3651]] I will ever [[H5703]] sing praise [[H2167]] to Your name, [[H8034]] fulfilling [[H7999]] my vows [[H5088]] day [[H3117]] by day. [[H3117]]
