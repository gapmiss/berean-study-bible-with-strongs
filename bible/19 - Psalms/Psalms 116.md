###### 1
I love [[H157]] the LORD, [[H3068]] for [[H3588]] He has heard [[H8085]] my voice— [[H6963]] my appeal for mercy. [[H8469]]

###### 2
Because [[H3588]] He has inclined [[H5186]] His ear [[H241]] to me,  I will call on Him [[H7121]] as long as I live. [[H3117]]

###### 3
The ropes [[H2256]] of death [[H4194]] entangled me, [[H661]] and the anguish [[H4712]] of Sheol [[H7585]] overcame me; [[H4672]] I was confronted [[H4672]] by trouble [[H6869]] and sorrow. [[H3015]]

###### 4
Then I called [[H7121]] on the name [[H8034]] of the LORD: [[H3068]] “O LORD, [[H3068]] deliver [[H4422]] my soul!” [[H5315]]

###### 5
The LORD [[H3068]] is gracious [[H2587]] and righteous; [[H6662]] our God [[H430]] is full of compassion. [[H7355]]

###### 6
The LORD [[H3068]] preserves [[H8104]] the simplehearted; [[H6612]] I was helpless, [[H1809]] and  He saved me. [[H3467]]

###### 7
Return to your rest, [[H7725]] O my soul, [[H5315]] for [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] has been good [[H1580]] to you. [[H5921]]

###### 8
For [[H3588]] You have delivered [[H2502]] my soul [[H5315]] from [[H4480]] death, [[H4194]] my eyes [[H5869]] from tears, [[H1832]] my feet [[H7272]] from stumbling. [[H1762]]

###### 9
I will walk [[H1980]] before [[H6440]] the LORD [[H3068]] in the land [[H776]] of the living. [[H2416]]

###### 10
I believed, [[H539]] therefore [[H3588]] I have spoken: [[H1696]] “I [[H589]] am greatly [[H3966]] afflicted.” [[H6031]]

###### 11
In my alarm [[H2648]] I [[H589]] said, [[H559]] “All [[H3605]] men [[H120]] [are] liars!” [[H3576]]

###### 12
How [[H4100]] can I repay [[H7725]] the LORD [[H3068]] for all [[H3605]] His goodness [[H8408]] to me? [[H5921]]

###### 13
I will lift [[H5375]] the cup [[H3563]] of salvation [[H3444]] and call [[H7121]] on the name [[H8034]] of the LORD. [[H3068]]

###### 14
I will fulfill [[H7999]] my vows [[H5088]] to the LORD [[H3068]] in the presence of [[H5048]] all [[H3605]] His people. [[H5971]]

###### 15
Precious [[H3368]] in the sight [[H5869]] of the LORD [[H3068]] [is] the death [[H4194]] of His saints. [[H2623]]

###### 16
Truly, [[H577]] O LORD, [[H3068]] I [am] [[H589]] Your servant; [[H5650]] I [[H589]] am Your servant, [[H5650]] the son [[H1121]] of Your maidservant; [[H519]] You have released [[H6605]] my bonds. [[H4147]]

###### 17
I will offer [[H2076]] to You  a sacrifice [[H2077]] of thanksgiving [[H8426]] and call [[H7121]] on the name [[H8034]] of the LORD. [[H3068]]

###### 18
I will fulfill [[H7999]] my vows [[H5088]] to the LORD [[H3068]] in the presence [[H5048]] of all [[H3605]] His people, [[H5971]]

###### 19
in the courts [[H2691]] of the LORD’s [[H3068]] house, [[H1004]] in your midst, [[H8432]] O Jerusalem. [[H3389]] Hallelujah! [[H1984]]
