### 1
For the choirmaster. [To the tune of] [[H5329]] “Do Not Destroy.” [[H516]] A Miktam [[H4387]] of David, [[H1732]] when he fled [[H1272]] from [[H6440]] Saul [[H7586]] into the cave. [[H4631]] Have mercy on me, [[H2603]] O God, [[H430]] have mercy, [[H2603]] for [[H3588]] in You  my soul [[H5315]] takes refuge. [[H2620]] In the shadow [[H6738]] of Your wings [[H3671]] I will take shelter [[H2620]] until [[H5704]] the danger [[H1942]] has passed. [[H5674]]

### 2
I cry out [[H7121]] to God [[H430]] Most High, [[H5945]] to God [[H410]] who fulfills [[H1584]] His purpose for me. [[H5921]]

### 3
He reaches down [[H7971]] from heaven [[H8064]] and saves me; [[H3467]] He rebukes [[H2778]] those who trample me. [[H7602]] Selah [[H5542]] God [[H430]] sends forth [[H7971]] His loving devotion [[H2617]] and His truth. [[H571]]

### 4
My soul [[H5315]] [is] among [[H8432]] the lions; [[H3833]] I lie down [[H7901]] with ravenous beasts [[H3857]] whose teeth [[H8127]] are spears [[H2595]] and arrows, [[H2671]] whose tongues [[H3956]] are sharp [[H2299]] swords. [[H2719]]

### 5
Be exalted, [[H7311]] O God, [[H430]] above [[H5921]] the heavens; [[H8064]] may Your glory [[H3519]] cover [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] the earth. [[H776]]

### 6
They spread [[H3559]] a net [[H7568]] for my feet; [[H6471]] my soul [[H5315]] was despondent. [[H3721]] They dug [[H3738]] a pit [[H7882]] before me, [[H6440]] but they themselves have fallen [[H5307]] into it! [[H8432]] Selah [[H5542]]

### 7
My heart [[H3820]] is steadfast, [[H3559]] O God, [[H430]] my heart [[H3820]] is steadfast. [[H3559]] I will sing [[H7891]] and make music. [[H2167]]

### 8
Awake, [[H5782]] O glory! [[H3519]] Awake, [[H5782]] O harp [[H5035]] and lyre! [[H3658]] I will awaken [[H5782]] the dawn. [[H7837]]

### 9
I will praise You, [[H3034]] O Lord, [[H136]] among the nations; [[H5971]] I will sing Your praises [[H2167]] among the peoples. [[H3816]]

### 10
For [[H3588]] Your loving devotion [[H2617]] reaches [[H1419]] to [[H5704]] the heavens, [[H8064]] Your faithfulness [[H571]] to the clouds. [[H7834]]

### 11
Be exalted, [[H7311]] O God, [[H430]] above [[H5921]] the heavens; [[H8064]] may Your glory [[H3519]] cover [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] the earth. [[H776]]
