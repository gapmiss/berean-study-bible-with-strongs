### 1
For the choirmaster. [[H5329]] To the tune of [[H5921]] “The Doe [[H365]] of the Dawn.” [[H7837]] A Psalm [[H4210]] of David. [[H1732]] My God, [[H410]] my God, [[H410]] why [[H4100]] have You forsaken me? [[H5800]] Why are You so far [[H7350]] from saving me, [[H3444]] [so far] from my words [[H1697]] of groaning? [[H7581]]

### 2
I cry out [[H7121]] by day, [[H3119]] O my God, [[H430]] but You do not answer, [[H6030]] and by night, [[H3915]] but I have no [[H3808]] rest. [[H1747]]

### 3
Yet You [[H859]] are holy, [[H6918]] enthroned [[H3427]] on the praises [[H8416]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

### 4
In You  our fathers [[H1]] trusted; [[H982]] they trusted [[H982]] and You delivered them. [[H6403]]

### 5
They cried out [[H2199]] to You [[H413]] and were set free; [[H4422]] they trusted [[H982]] in You  and were not [[H3808]] disappointed. [[H954]]

### 6
But I [[H595]] am a worm [[H8438]] and not [[H3808]] a man, [[H376]] scorned [[H2781]] by men [[H120]] and despised [[H959]] by the people. [[H5971]]

### 7
All [[H3605]] who see me [[H7200]] mock me; [[H3932]] they sneer [[H6362]] and shake [[H5128]] their heads: [[H7218]]

### 8
“He trusts [[H1556]] in [[H413]] the LORD, [[H3068]] let the LORD deliver him; [[H6403]] let the LORD rescue him, [[H5337]] since [[H3588]] He delights in him.” [[H2654]]

### 9
Yet [[H3588]] You [[H859]] brought me [[H1518]] out of the womb; [[H990]] You secured me [[H982]] at [[H5921]] my mother’s [[H517]] breast. [[H7699]]

### 10
From birth [[H7358]] I was cast [[H7993]] upon You; [[H5921]] from my mother’s [[H517]] womb [[H990]] You [[H859]] have been my God. [[H410]]

### 11
Be not [[H408]] far [[H7368]] from me, [[H4480]] for [[H3588]] trouble [[H6869]] is near [[H7138]] and [[H3588]] there is no [[H369]] one to help. [[H5826]]

### 12
Many [[H7227]] bulls [[H6499]] surround me; [[H5437]] strong [[H47]] [bulls] of Bashan [[H1316]] encircle me. [[H3803]]

### 13
They open [[H6475]] their jaws [[H6310]] against me [[H5921]] like lions [[H738]] that roar [[H7580]] and maul. [[H2963]]

### 14
I am poured out [[H8210]] like water, [[H4325]] and all [[H3605]] my bones [[H6106]] are disjointed. [[H6504]] My heart [[H3820]] is [[H1961]] like wax; [[H1749]] it melts away [[H4549]] within [[H8432]] me. [[H4578]]

### 15
My strength [[H3581]] is dried up [[H3001]] like a potsherd, [[H2789]] and my tongue [[H3956]] sticks [[H1692]] to the roof of my mouth. [[H4455]] You lay me [[H8239]] in the dust [[H6083]] of death. [[H4194]]

### 16
For [[H3588]] dogs [[H3611]] surround me; [[H5437]] a band [[H5712]] of evil men [[H7489]] encircles me; [[H5362]] they have pierced [[H3738]] my hands [[H3027]] and feet. [[H7272]]

### 17
I can count [[H5608]] all [[H3605]] my bones; [[H6106]] they [[H1992]] stare [[H5027]] and gloat over me. [[H7200]]

### 18
They divide [[H2505]] my garments [[H899]] among them [[H1992]] and cast [[H5307]] lots [[H1486]] for [[H5921]] my clothing. [[H3830]]

### 19
But You, [[H859]] O LORD, [[H3068]] be not [[H408]] far off; [[H7368]] O my strength, [[H360]] come quickly [[H2363]] to help. [[H5833]]

### 20
Deliver [[H5337]] my soul [[H5315]] from the sword, [[H2719]] my precious life [[H3173]] from the power [[H3027]] of wild dogs. [[H3611]]

### 21
Save me [[H3467]] from the mouth [[H6310]] of the lion; [[H738]] at the horns [[H7161]] of the wild oxen [[H7214]] You have answered Me! [[H6030]]

### 22
I will proclaim [[H5608]] Your name [[H8034]] to my brothers; [[H251]] I will praise You [[H1984]] in [[H8432]] the assembly. [[H6951]]

### 23
You who fear [[H3373]] the LORD, [[H3068]] praise Him! [[H1984]] All [[H3605]] descendants [[H2233]] of Jacob, [[H3290]] honor Him! [[H3513]] All [[H3605]] offspring [[H2233]] of Israel, [[H3478]] revere Him! [[H1481]]

### 24
For [[H3588]] He has not [[H3808]] despised [[H959]] or detested [[H8262]] the torment [[H6039]] of the afflicted. [[H6041]] He has not [[H3808]] hidden [[H5641]] His face [[H6440]] from him, [[H4480]] but has attended [[H8085]] to his [[H413]] cry for help. [[H7768]]

### 25
From You [[H853]] comes my praise [[H8416]] in the great [[H7227]] assembly; [[H6951]] before [[H5048]] those who fear You [[H3373]] I will fulfill [[H7999]] my vows. [[H5088]]

### 26
The poor [[H6035]] will eat [[H398]] and be satisfied; [[H7646]] those who seek [[H1875]] the LORD [[H3068]] will praise Him. [[H1984]] May your hearts [[H3824]] live [[H2421]] forever! [[H5703]]

### 27
All [[H3605]] the ends [[H657]] of the earth [[H776]] will remember [[H2142]] and turn [[H7725]] to [[H413]] the LORD. [[H3068]] All [[H3605]] the families [[H4940]] of the nations [[H1471]] will bow down [[H7812]] before Him. [[H6440]]

### 28
For [[H3588]] dominion [[H4410]] belongs to the LORD [[H3068]] and He rules [[H4910]] over the nations. [[H1471]]

### 29
All [[H3605]] the rich [[H1879]] of the earth [[H776]] will feast [[H398]] and worship; [[H7812]] all [[H3605]] who go down [[H3381]] to the dust [[H6083]] will kneel [[H3766]] before Him— [[H6440]] even those unable [[H3808]] to preserve [[H2421]] their lives. [[H5315]]

### 30
Posterity [[H2233]] will serve Him; [[H5647]] they will declare [[H5608]] the Lord [[H136]] to a new generation. [[H1755]]

### 31
They will come [[H935]] and proclaim [[H5046]] His righteousness [[H6666]] to a people [[H5971]] yet unborn— [[H3205]] all that [[H3588]] He has done. [[H6213]]
