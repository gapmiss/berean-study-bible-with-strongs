### 1
Rejoice [[H7442]] in the LORD, [[H3068]] O you righteous; [[H6662]] befitting is [[H5000]] the praise [[H8416]] of the upright. [[H3477]]

### 2
Praise [[H3034]] the LORD [[H3068]] with the harp; [[H3658]] make music [[H2167]] to Him  with ten strings. [[H6218]]

### 3
Sing [[H7891]] to Him  a new [[H2319]] song; [[H7892]] play [[H5059]] skillfully [[H3190]] with a shout of joy. [[H8643]]

### 4
For [[H3588]] the word [[H1697]] of the LORD [[H3068]] is upright, [[H3477]] and all [[H3605]] His work [[H4639]] is trustworthy. [[H530]]

### 5
[The LORD] loves [[H157]] righteousness [[H6666]] and justice; [[H4941]] the earth [[H776]] is full of [[H4390]] [His] [[H3068]] loving devotion. [[H2617]]

### 6
By the word [[H1697]] of the LORD [[H3068]] the heavens [[H8064]] were made, [[H6213]] and all [[H3605]] the stars [[H6635]] by the breath [[H7307]] of His mouth. [[H6310]]

### 7
He piles up [[H3664]] the waters [[H4325]] of the sea; [[H3220]] He puts [[H5414]] the depths [[H8415]] into storehouses. [[H214]]

### 8
Let all [[H3605]] the earth [[H776]] fear [[H3372]] the LORD; [[H3068]] let all [[H3605]] the people [[H3427]] of the world [[H8398]] revere Him. [[H1481]]

### 9
For [[H3588]] He [[H1931]] spoke, [[H559]] and it came to be; [[H1961]] He [[H1931]] commanded, [[H6680]] and it stood fast. [[H5975]]

### 10
The LORD [[H3068]] frustrates [[H6331]] the plans [[H6098]] of the nations; [[H1471]] He thwarts [[H5106]] the devices [[H4284]] of the peoples. [[H5971]]

### 11
The counsel [[H6098]] of the LORD [[H3068]] stands forever, [[H5975]] the purposes [[H4284]] of His heart [[H3820]] to all [[H1755]] generations. [[H1755]]

### 12
Blessed [[H835]] [is] the nation [[H1471]] whose [[H834]] God [[H430]] is the LORD, [[H3068]] the people [[H5971]] He has chosen [[H977]] as His inheritance! [[H5159]]

### 13
The LORD [[H3068]] looks down [[H5027]] from heaven; [[H8064]] He sees [[H7200]] all [[H3605]] the sons [[H1121]] of men. [[H120]]

### 14
From His dwelling [[H3427]] place [[H4349]] He gazes [[H7688]] on [[H413]] all [[H3605]] who inhabit [[H3427]] the earth. [[H776]]

### 15
He shapes [[H3335]] the hearts [[H3820]] of each; [[H3162]] He considers [[H995]] all [[H3605]] their works. [[H4639]]

### 16
No [[H369]] king [[H4428]] is saved [[H3467]] by his vast [[H7230]] army; [[H2428]] no [[H3808]] warrior [[H1368]] is delivered [[H5337]] by his great [[H7230]] strength. [[H3581]]

### 17
A horse [[H5483]] is a vain hope [[H8267]] for salvation; [[H8668]] even its great [[H7230]] strength [[H2428]] cannot [[H3808]] save. [[H4422]]

### 18
Surely [[H2009]] the eyes [[H5869]] of the LORD [[H3068]] are on [[H413]] those who fear Him, [[H3373]] on those whose hope [[H3176]] is in His loving devotion [[H2617]]

### 19
to deliver [[H5337]] them [[H5315]] from death [[H4194]] and keep them alive [[H2421]] in famine. [[H7458]]

### 20
Our soul [[H5315]] waits [[H2442]] for the LORD; [[H3068]] He [[H1931]] is our help [[H5828]] and our shield. [[H4043]]

### 21
For [[H3588]] our hearts [[H3820]] rejoice in Him, [[H8055]] since [[H3588]] we trust [[H982]] in His holy [[H6944]] name. [[H8034]]

### 22
May Your loving devotion [[H2617]] rest [[H1961]] on us, [[H5921]] O LORD, [[H3068]] as [[H834]] we put our hope in You. [[H3176]]
