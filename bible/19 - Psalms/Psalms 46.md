###### 1
For the choirmaster. [[H5329]] Of the sons [[H1121]] of Korah. [[H7141]] According to [[H5921]] Alamoth. [[H5961]] A Song. [[H7892]] God [[H430]] is our refuge [[H4268]] and strength, [[H5797]] an ever-present [[H4672]] help [[H5833]] in times of trouble. [[H6869]]

###### 2
Therefore [[H5921]] we will not [[H3808]] fear, [[H3372]] though the earth [[H776]] is transformed [[H4171]] and the mountains [[H2022]] are toppled [[H4131]] into the depths [[H3820]] of the seas, [[H3220]]

###### 3
though its waters [[H4325]] roar [[H1993]] and foam [[H2560]] and the mountains [[H2022]] quake [[H7493]] in the surge. [[H1346]] Selah [[H5542]]

There is a river [[H5104]] whose streams [[H6388]] delight [[H8055]] the city [[H5892]] of God, [[H430]] the holy [place where] [[H6918]] the Most High [[H5945]] dwells. [[H4908]]

God [[H430]] is within her; [[H7130]] she will not [[H1077]] be moved. [[H4131]] God [[H430]] will help her [[H5826]] when morning [[H1242]] dawns. [[H6437]]

###### 6
Nations [[H1471]] rage, [[H1993]] kingdoms [[H4467]] crumble; [[H4131]] the earth [[H776]] melts [[H4127]] when He lifts [[H5414]] His voice. [[H6963]]

The LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts [[H6635]] is with us; [[H5973]] the God [[H430]] of Jacob [[H3290]] is our fortress. [[H4869]] Selah [[H5542]]

Come, [[H1980]] see [[H2372]] the works [[H4659]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] who [[H834]] brings [[H7760]] devastation [[H8047]] upon the earth. [[H776]]

###### 9
He makes wars [[H4421]] to cease [[H7673]] throughout [[H5704]] the earth; [[H776]] He breaks [[H7665]] the bow [[H7198]] and shatters [[H7112]] the spear; [[H2595]] He burns [[H8313]] the shields [[H5699]] in the fire. [[H784]]

###### 10
“Be still [[H7503]] and know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I [[H595]] am God; [[H430]] I will be exalted [[H7311]] among the nations, [[H1471]] I will be exalted [[H7311]] over the earth.” [[H776]]
