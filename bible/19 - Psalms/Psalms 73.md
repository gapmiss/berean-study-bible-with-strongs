###### 1
A Psalm [[H4210]] of Asaph. [[H623]] Surely [[H389]] God [[H430]] [is] good [[H2896]] to Israel, [[H3478]] to those who are pure [[H1249]] in heart. [[H3824]]

###### 2
But as for me, [[H589]] my feet [[H7272]] had almost [[H4592]] stumbled; [[H5186]] my steps [[H838]] had nearly [[H369]] slipped. [[H8210]]

###### 3
For [[H3588]] I envied [[H7065]] the arrogant [[H1984]] [when] I saw [[H7200]] the prosperity [[H7965]] of the wicked. [[H7563]]

###### 4
They have no [[H369]] struggle [[H2784]] in their death; [[H4194]] their bodies [[H193]] are well-fed. [[H1277]]

###### 5
They are free [[H369]] of the burdens [[H5999]] others carry; [[H582]] they are not [[H3808]] afflicted [[H5060]] like [[H5973]] [other] men. [[H120]]

###### 6
Therefore [[H3651]] pride [[H1346]] is their necklace; [[H6059]] a garment [[H7897]] of violence [[H2555]] covers them. [[H5848]]

###### 7
From their callous hearts [[H5869]] proceeds [[H3318]] iniquity; [[H2459]] the imaginations [[H4906]] of their hearts [[H3824]] run wild. [[H5674]]

###### 8
They mock [[H4167]] and speak [[H1696]] with malice; [[H7451]] with arrogance [[H4791]] they threaten [[H1696]] oppression. [[H6233]]

###### 9
They set [[H8371]] their mouths [[H6310]] against the heavens, [[H8064]] and their tongues [[H3956]] strut [[H1980]] across the earth. [[H776]]

###### 10
So [[H3651]] His people [[H5971]] return [[H7725]] to this place [[H1988]] and drink up [[H4680]] waters [[H4325]] in abundance. [[H4392]]

###### 11
The wicked say, [[H559]] “How [[H349]] can God [[H410]] know? [[H3045]] Does the Most High [[H5945]] have knowledge?” [[H1844]]

###### 12
Behold, [[H2009]] these [are] [[H428]] the wicked— [[H7563]] always [[H5769]] carefree [[H7961]] as they increase [[H7685]] their wealth. [[H2428]]

###### 13
Surely [[H389]] in vain [[H7385]] I have kept my heart pure; [[H2135]] in innocence [[H5356]] I have washed [[H7364]] my hands. [[H3709]]

###### 14
For I am [[H1961]] afflicted [[H5060]] all day long [[H3605]] and punished every morning. [[H8433]]

###### 15
If [[H518]] I had said, [[H559]] “I will speak [[H5608]] this way,” [[H3644]] then [[H2009]] I would have betrayed [[H898]] Your children. [[H1121]]

###### 16
When I tried [[H2803]] to understand [[H3045]] all this, [[H2063]] it [[H1931]] was troublesome [[H5999]] in my sight [[H5869]]

###### 17
until [[H5704]] I entered [[H935]] God’s [[H410]] sanctuary; [[H4720]] then I discerned [[H995]] their end. [[H319]]

###### 18
Surely [[H389]] You set them [[H7896]] on slick ground; [[H2513]] You cast them down [[H5307]] into ruin. [[H4876]]

###### 19
How [[H349]] suddenly [[H7281]] they are [[H1961]] laid waste, [[H8047]] completely [[H8552]] swept away [[H5486]] by [[H4480]] terrors! [[H1091]]

###### 20
Like a dream [[H2472]] when [one] awakens, [[H6974]] upon arising, [[H5782]] O Lord, [[H136]] You will despise [[H959]] their form. [[H6754]]

###### 21
When [[H3588]] my heart [[H3824]] was grieved [[H2556]] and I was pierced [[H8150]] within, [[H3629]]

###### 22
I was [[H589]] senseless [[H1198]] and [[H3808]] ignorant; [[H3045]] I was [[H1961]] a brute beast [[H929]] before You. [[H5973]]

###### 23
Yet I [[H589]] am always [[H8548]] with You; [[H5973]] You hold [[H270]] my right [[H3225]] hand. [[H3027]]

###### 24
You guide [[H5148]] me with Your counsel, [[H6098]] and later [[H310]] receive me [[H3947]] in glory. [[H3519]]

###### 25
Whom have I [[H4310]] in heaven but You? [[H8064]] And on earth [[H776]] I desire [[H2654]] no one [[H3808]] besides You. [[H5973]]

###### 26
My flesh [[H7607]] and my heart [[H3824]] may fail, [[H3615]] but God [[H430]] is the strength [[H6697]] of my heart [[H3824]] and my portion [[H2506]] forever. [[H5769]]

###### 27
Those far [[H7369]] from You [[H3588]] will surely [[H2009]] perish; [[H6]] You destroy [[H6789]] all [[H3605]] who are unfaithful [[H2181]] to You. [[H4480]]

###### 28
But as for me, [[H589]] [it is] good [[H2896]] to draw near [[H7132]] to God. [[H430]] I have made [[H7896]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD [[H3069]] my refuge, [[H4268]] that I may proclaim [[H5608]] all [[H3605]] Your works. [[H4399]]
