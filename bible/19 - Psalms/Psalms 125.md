# Psalms 125

[[Psalms 124|←]] • [[Psalms 126|→]]

---

###### 1
A Song [[H7892]] of Ascents. [[H4609]] Those who trust [[H982]] in the LORD [[H3068]] are like Mount [[H2022]] Zion. [[H6726]] It cannot [[H3808]] be moved; [[H4131]] it abides forever. [[H3427]]

###### 2
As the mountains [[H2022]] surround [[H5439]] Jerusalem, [[H3389]] so the LORD [[H3068]] surrounds [[H5439]] His people, [[H5971]] both now [[H6258]] and forevermore. [[H5704]]

###### 3
For [[H3588]] the scepter [[H7626]] of the wicked [[H7562]] will not [[H3808]] rest [[H5117]] upon [[H5921]] the land allotted [[H1486]] to the righteous, [[H6662]] so that [[H4616]] the righteous [[H6662]] will not [[H3808]] put forth [[H7971]] their hands [[H3027]] to injustice. [[H5766]]

###### 4
Do good, [[H2895]] O LORD, [[H3068]] to [those who are] good, [[H2896]] and to the upright [[H3477]] in heart. [[H3826]]

###### 5
But those who turn aside [[H5186]] to crooked ways, [[H6128]] the LORD [[H3068]] will banish [[H1980]] with the evildoers. [[H6466]] Peace [[H7965]] be upon [[H5921]] Israel. [[H3478]]
