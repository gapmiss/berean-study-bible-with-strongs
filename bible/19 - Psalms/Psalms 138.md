###### 1
Of David. [[H1732]] I will give You thanks [[H3034]] with all [[H3605]] my heart; [[H3820]] before [[H5048]] the heavenly beings [[H430]] I will sing Your praises. [[H2167]]

###### 2
I will bow down [[H7812]] toward [[H413]] Your holy [[H6944]] temple [[H1964]] and give thanks [[H3034]] to Your name [[H8034]] for [[H5921]] Your loving devotion [[H2617]] and [[H5921]] Your faithfulness; [[H571]] You [[H3588]] have exalted [[H1431]] Your name [[H8034]] and Your word [[H565]] above [[H5921]] all else. [[H3605]]

###### 3
On the day [[H3117]] I called, [[H7121]] You answered me; [[H6030]] You made me bold [[H7292]] [and] strengthened [[H5797]] my soul. [[H5315]]

###### 4
All [[H3605]] the kings [[H4428]] of the earth [[H776]] will give You thanks, [[H3034]] O LORD, [[H3068]] when [[H3588]] they hear [[H8085]] the words [[H561]] of Your mouth. [[H6310]]

###### 5
They will sing [[H7891]] of the ways [[H1870]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] for [[H3588]] the glory [[H3519]] of the LORD [[H3068]] is great. [[H1419]]

###### 6
Though [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] is on high, [[H7311]] He attends [[H7200]] to the lowly; [[H8217]] but the proud [[H1364]] He knows [[H3045]] from afar. [[H4801]]

###### 7
If [[H518]] I walk [[H1980]] in the midst [[H7130]] of trouble, [[H6869]] You preserve me [[H2421]] from [[H5921]] the anger [[H639]] of my foes; [[H341]] You will extend [[H7971]] Your hand, [[H3027]] and Your right hand [[H3225]] will save me. [[H3467]]

###### 8
The LORD [[H3068]] will fulfill [His purpose] [[H1584]] in me. [[H1157]] O LORD, [[H3068]] Your loving devotion [[H2617]] endures forever— [[H5769]] do not [[H408]] abandon [[H7503]] the works [[H4639]] of Your hands. [[H3027]]
