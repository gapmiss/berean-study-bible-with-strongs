### 1
For the choirmaster. [[H5329]] A Psalm of David, [[H1732]] the servant [[H5650]] of the LORD. [[H3068]] An oracle [[H5002]] is in [[H7130]] my heart [[H3820]] regarding the transgression [[H6588]] of the wicked man: [[H7563]] There is no [[H369]] fear [[H6343]] of God [[H430]] before [[H5048]] his eyes. [[H5869]]

### 2
For [[H3588]] his eyes [[H5869]] are too full of conceit [[H2505]] to detect [[H4672]] or hate [[H8130]] his own sin. [[H5771]]

### 3
The words [[H1697]] of his mouth [[H6310]] are wicked [[H205]] and deceitful; [[H4820]] he has ceased [[H2308]] to be wise [[H7919]] [and] well-doing. [[H3190]]

### 4
Even on [[H5921]] his bed [[H4904]] he plots [[H2803]] wickedness; [[H205]] he sets [[H3320]] himself on [[H5921]] a path [[H1870]] that is not [[H3808]] good; [[H2896]] he does not [[H3808]] reject [[H3988]] evil. [[H7451]]

### 5
Your loving devotion, [[H2617]] O LORD, [[H3068]] reaches to the heavens, [[H8064]] Your steadfastness [[H530]] to [[H5704]] the clouds. [[H7834]]

### 6
Your righteousness [[H6666]] is like the highest [[H410]] mountains, [[H2042]] Your judgments [[H4941]] like the deepest sea. [[H8415]] O LORD, [[H3068]] You preserve [[H3467]] man [[H120]] and beast. [[H929]]

### 7
How [[H4100]] precious [[H3368]] is Your loving devotion, [[H2617]] O God, [[H430]] that the children [[H1121]] of men [[H120]] take refuge [[H2620]] in the shadow [[H6738]] of Your wings. [[H3671]]

### 8
They feast on [[H7301]] the abundance [[H1880]] of Your house, [[H1004]] and You give them drink [[H8248]] from Your river [[H5158]] of delights. [[H5730]]

### 9
For [[H3588]] with You [[H5973]] is the fountain [[H4726]] of life; [[H2416]] in Your light [[H216]] we see [[H7200]] light. [[H216]]

### 10
Extend [[H4900]] Your loving devotion [[H2617]] to those who know You, [[H3045]] and Your righteousness [[H6666]] to the upright [[H3477]] in heart. [[H3820]]

### 11
Let not [[H408]] the foot [[H7272]] of the proud [[H1346]] come against me, [[H935]] nor the hand [[H3027]] of the wicked [[H7563]] drive [[H5110]] me away. [[H408]]

### 12
There [[H8033]] the evildoers [[H6466]] lie fallen, [[H5307]] thrown down [[H1760]] and unable [[H3808]] to rise. [[H6965]]
