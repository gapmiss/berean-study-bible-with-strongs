### 1
Of David. [[H1732]] To You, [[H413]] O LORD, [[H3068]] I call; [[H7121]] be not [[H408]] deaf [[H2790]] to me, [[H4480]] O my rock. [[H6697]] For if [[H6435]] You remain silent, [[H2790]] I will be like [[H4911]] those [[H5973]] descending [[H3381]] to the Pit. [[H953]]

### 2
Hear [[H8085]] my cry [[H6963]] for mercy [[H8469]] when I call [[H7768]] to You {for help}, [[H413]] when I lift up [[H5375]] my hands [[H3027]] toward [[H413]] Your holy [[H6944]] sanctuary. [[H1687]]

### 3
Do not [[H408]] drag me away [[H4900]] with [[H5973]] the wicked, [[H7563]] and with [[H5973]] the workers [[H6466]] of iniquity, [[H205]] who speak [[H1696]] peace [[H7965]] to [[H5973]] their neighbors [[H7453]] while malice [[H7451]] is in their hearts. [[H3824]]

### 4
Repay [[H5414]] them [[H1992]] according to their deeds, [[H6467]] and for their works [[H4611]] of evil. [[H7455]] Repay [[H5414]] them [[H1992]] for what their hands [[H3027]] have done; [[H4639]] bring back [[H7725]] on them [[H1992]] what they deserve. [[H1576]]

### 5
Since [[H3588]] they show no [[H3808]] regard [[H995]] for the works [[H6468]] of the LORD [[H3068]] or [[H413]] what His hands [[H3027]] have done, [[H4639]] He will tear them down [[H2040]] and never [[H3808]] rebuild them. [[H1129]]

### 6
Blessed be [[H1288]] the LORD, [[H3068]] for [[H3588]] He has heard [[H8085]] my cry [[H6963]] for mercy. [[H8469]]

### 7
The LORD [[H3068]] is my strength [[H5797]] and my shield; [[H4043]] my heart [[H3820]] trusts in Him, [[H982]] and I am helped. [[H5826]] Therefore my heart [[H3820]] rejoices, [[H5937]] and I will thank Him [[H3034]] with my song. [[H7892]]

### 8
The LORD [[H3068]] is the strength of His people, [[H5797]] a stronghold [[H4581]] of salvation [[H3444]] for His anointed. [[H4899]]

### 9
Save [[H3467]] Your people [[H5971]] and bless [[H1288]] Your inheritance; [[H5159]] shepherd them [[H7462]] and carry [[H5375]] them [[H5704]] forever. [[H5769]]
