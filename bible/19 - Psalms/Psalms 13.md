###### 1
For the choirmaster. [[H5329]] A Psalm [[H4210]] of David. [[H1732]] How long, [[H5704]] O LORD? [[H3068]] Will You forget [[H7911]] me [[H575]] forever? [[H5331]] How long [[H5704]] will You hide [[H5641]] Your face [[H6440]] from me? [[H4480]]

###### 2
How long [[H5704]] must I wrestle [[H7896]] in my soul, [[H5315]] with sorrow [[H3015]] in my heart [[H3824]] each day? [[H3119]] How long [[H5704]] will my enemy [[H341]] dominate [[H7311]] me? [[H5921]]

###### 3
See me [[H5027]] [and] respond, [[H6030]] O LORD [[H3068]] my God. [[H430]] Give light [[H215]] to my eyes, [[H5869]] lest [[H6435]] I sleep [[H3462]] in death, [[H4194]]

###### 4
lest [[H6435]] my enemy [[H341]] say, [[H559]] “I have overcome him,” [[H3201]] and my foes [[H6862]] rejoice [[H1523]] when [[H3588]] I fall. [[H4131]]

###### 5
But I [[H589]] have trusted [[H982]] in Your loving devotion; [[H2617]] my heart [[H3820]] will rejoice [[H1523]] in Your salvation. [[H3444]]

###### 6
I will sing [[H7891]] to the LORD, [[H3068]] for [[H3588]] He has been good [[H1580]] to me. [[H5921]]
