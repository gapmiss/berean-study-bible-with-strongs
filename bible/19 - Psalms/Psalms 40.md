### 1
For the choirmaster. [[H5329]] A Psalm [[H4210]] of David. [[H1732]] I waited patiently for [[H6960]] the LORD; [[H3068]] He inclined [[H5186]] to me [[H413]] and heard [[H8085]] my cry. [[H7775]]

### 2
He lifted me up [[H5927]] from the pit [[H953]] of destruction, [[H7588]] out of the miry [[H3121]] clay; [[H2916]] He set [[H6965]] my feet [[H7272]] upon [[H5921]] a rock, [[H5553]] [and] made my footsteps [[H838]] firm. [[H3559]]

### 3
He put [[H5414]] a new [[H2319]] song [[H7892]] in my mouth, [[H6310]] a hymn of praise [[H8416]] to our God. [[H430]] Many [[H7227]] will see [[H7200]] and fear [[H3372]] and put their trust [[H982]] in the LORD. [[H3068]]

### 4
Blessed [[H835]] is the man [[H1397]] who [[H834]] has made [[H7760]] the LORD [[H3068]] his trust, [[H4009]] who has not [[H3808]] turned [[H6437]] to [[H413]] the proud, [[H7295]] nor to those who lapse [[H7750]] into falsehood! [[H3577]]

### 5
Many, [[H7227]] O LORD [[H3068]] my God, [[H430]] are the wonders [[H6381]] You [[H859]] have done, [[H6213]] and the plans You have [[H4284]] for us— [[H413]] none [[H369]] can compare [[H6186]] to You— [[H413]] if I would proclaim [[H5046]] and declare of them, [[H1696]] they are more [[H6105]] than could be numbered. [[H5608]]

### 6
Sacrifice [[H2077]] and offering [[H4503]] You did not [[H3808]] desire, [[H2654]] but my ears [[H241]] You have opened. [[H3738]] Burnt offerings [[H5930]] and sin offerings [[H2401]] You did not [[H3808]] require. [[H7592]]

### 7
Then [[H227]] I said, [[H559]] “Here I am, [[H2009]] I have come— [[H935]] it is written [[H3789]] about me [[H5921]] in the scroll: [[H4039]]

### 8
I delight [[H2654]] to do [[H6213]] Your will, [[H7522]] O my God; [[H430]] Your law [[H8451]] [is] within [[H8432]] my heart.” [[H4578]]

### 9
I proclaim [[H1319]] righteousness [[H6664]] in the great [[H7227]] assembly; [[H6951]] behold, [[H2009]] I do not [[H3808]] seal [[H3607]] my lips, [[H8193]] as You [[H859]] know, [[H3045]] O LORD. [[H3068]]

### 10
I have not [[H3808]] covered up [[H3680]] Your righteousness [[H6666]] in [[H8432]] my heart; [[H3820]] I have declared [[H559]] Your faithfulness [[H530]] and salvation; [[H8668]] I have not [[H3808]] concealed [[H3582]] Your loving devotion [[H2617]] or truth [[H571]] from the great [[H7227]] assembly. [[H6951]]

### 11
O LORD, [[H3068]] do not [[H3808]] withhold [[H3607]] Your mercy [[H7356]] from me; [[H4480]] Your loving devotion [[H2617]] and truth [[H571]] will always [[H8548]] guard me. [[H5341]]

### 12
For [[H3588]] evils [[H7451]] without [[H369]] number [[H4557]] surround me; [[H661]] my sins [[H5771]] have overtaken me, [[H5381]] so that I cannot [[H3808]] see. [[H7200]] They are more [[H6105]] than the hairs [[H8185]] of my head, [[H7218]] and my heart [[H3820]] has failed within me. [[H5800]]

### 13
Be pleased, [[H7521]] O LORD, [[H3068]] to deliver me; [[H5337]] hurry, [[H2363]] O LORD, [[H3068]] to help me. [[H5833]]

### 14
May those who seek [[H1245]] my life [[H5315]] be ashamed [[H954]] and confounded; [[H2659]] may those who wish [[H2655]] me harm [[H7451]] be repelled [[H5472]] and humiliated. [[H3637]]

### 15
May those who say [[H559]] to me,  “Aha, [[H1889]] aha!” [[H1889]] be appalled [[H8074]] at [[H5921]] their own shame. [[H1322]]

### 16
May all [[H3605]] who seek You [[H1245]] rejoice [[H7797]] and be glad [[H8055]] in You;  may those who love [[H157]] Your salvation [[H8668]] always [[H8548]] say, [[H559]] “The LORD [[H3068]] be magnified!” [[H1431]]

### 17
But I [am] [[H589]] poor [[H6041]] and needy; [[H34]] may the Lord [[H136]] think of me. [[H2803]] You [[H859]] are my helper [[H5833]] and deliverer; [[H6403]] O my God, [[H430]] do not [[H408]] delay. [[H309]]
