###### 1
For the choirmaster. [[H5329]] A Psalm [[H4210]] of David. [[H1732]] O LORD, [[H3068]] the king [[H4428]] rejoices [[H8055]] in Your strength. [[H5797]] How [[H4100]] greatly [[H3966]] he exults [[H1523]] in Your salvation! [[H3444]]

###### 2
You have granted [[H5414]] his heart’s [[H3820]] desire [[H8378]] and have not [[H1077]] withheld [[H4513]] the request [[H782]] of his lips. [[H8193]] Selah [[H5542]]

###### 3
For [[H3588]] You welcomed him [[H6923]] with rich [[H2896]] blessings; [[H1293]] You placed [[H7896]] on his head [[H7218]] a crown [[H5850]] of pure gold. [[H6337]]

###### 4
He asked You for [[H7592]] life, [[H2416]] and You granted it— [[H5414]] length [[H753]] of days, [[H3117]] forever [[H5769]] and ever. [[H5703]]

###### 5
Great is [[H1419]] his glory [[H3519]] in Your salvation; [[H3444]] You bestow [[H7737]] on him [[H5921]] splendor [[H1935]] and majesty. [[H1926]]

###### 6
For [[H3588]] You grant [[H7896]] him blessings forever; [[H1293]] You cheer [[H2302]] him with joy [[H8057]] in [[H854]] Your presence. [[H6440]]

###### 7
For [[H3588]] the king [[H4428]] trusts [[H982]] in the LORD; [[H3068]] through the loving devotion [[H2617]] of the Most High, [[H5945]] he will not [[H1077]] be shaken. [[H4131]]

###### 8
Your hand [[H3027]] will apprehend [[H4672]] all [[H3605]] your enemies; [[H341]] Your right hand [[H3225]] will seize [[H4672]] those who hate you. [[H8130]]

###### 9
You will place them [[H7896]] in a fiery [[H784]] furnace [[H8574]] at the time [[H6256]] of Your appearing. [[H6440]] In His wrath [[H639]] the LORD [[H3068]] will engulf them, [[H1104]] and the fire [[H784]] will consume them. [[H398]]

###### 10
You will wipe [[H6]] their descendants [[H6529]] from the earth, [[H776]] and their offspring [[H2233]] from the sons [[H1121]] of men. [[H120]]

###### 11
Though [[H3588]] they intend [[H5186]] You [[H5921]] harm, [[H7451]] the schemes [[H4209]] they devise [[H2803]] will not [[H1077]] prevail. [[H3201]]

###### 12
For [[H3588]] You will put them to flight [[H7896]] when Your bow [[H4340]] is trained [[H3559]] upon [[H5921]] them. [[H6440]]

###### 13
Be exalted, [[H7311]] O LORD, [[H3068]] in Your strength; [[H5797]] we will sing [[H7891]] and praise [[H2167]] Your power. [[H1369]]
