# Psalms 129

[[Psalms 128|←]] • [[Psalms 130|→]]

---

###### 1
A Song [[H7892]] of Ascents. [[H4609]] Many a time [[H7227]] they have persecuted me [[H6887]] from my youth— [[H5271]] let Israel [[H3478]] now [[H4994]] declare— [[H559]]

###### 2
many a time [[H7227]] they have persecuted me [[H6887]] from my youth, [[H5271]] but [[H1571]] they have not [[H3808]] prevailed [[H3201]] against me. 

###### 3
The plowmen [[H2790]] plowed [[H2790]] over [[H5921]] my back; [[H1354]] they made their furrows [[H4618]] long. [[H748]]

###### 4
The LORD [[H3068]] is righteous; [[H6662]] He has cut me [[H7112]] from the cords [[H5688]] of the wicked. [[H7563]]

###### 5
May all [[H3605]] who hate [[H8130]] Zion [[H6726]] be turned [[H5472]] back [[H268]] in shame. [[H954]]

###### 6
May they be [[H1961]] like grass [[H2682]] on the rooftops, [[H1406]] which withers [[H3001]] before [[H6927]] it can grow, [[H8025]]

###### 7
unable [[H3808]] to fill [[H4390]] the hands [[H3709]] of the reaper, [[H7114]] or the arms [[H2683]] of the one who binds sheaves. [[H6014]]

###### 8
May none [[H3808]] who pass by [[H5674]] say [to them], [[H559]] “The blessing [[H1293]] of the LORD [[H3068]] be on you. [[H413]] We bless [[H1288]] you [[H853]] in the name [[H8034]] of the LORD.” [[H3068]]
