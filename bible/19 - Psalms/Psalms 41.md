###### 1
For the choirmaster. [[H5329]] A Psalm [[H4210]] of David. [[H1732]] Blessed [[H835]] [is] he who cares [[H7919]] for [[H413]] the poor; [[H1800]] the LORD [[H3068]] will deliver him [[H4422]] in the day [[H3117]] of trouble. [[H7451]]

###### 2
The LORD [[H3068]] will protect [[H8104]] and preserve him; [[H2421]] He will bless him [[H833]] in the land [[H776]] and will not [[H408]] surrender him [[H5414]] to the will [[H5315]] of his foes. [[H341]]

###### 3
The LORD [[H3068]] will sustain [[H5582]] him on [[H5921]] his bed [[H6210]] of illness [[H1741]] and restore him [[H2015]] from his bed [[H4904]] of sickness. [[H2483]]

###### 4
I [[H589]] said, [[H559]] “O LORD, [[H3068]] be gracious to me; [[H2603]] heal [[H7495]] me, [[H5315]] for [[H3588]] I have sinned against You.” [[H2398]]

###### 5
My enemies [[H341]] say [[H559]] with malice: [[H7451]] “When [[H4970]] will he die [[H4191]] and be forgotten?” [[H6]]

###### 6
My visitor [[H518]] speaks [[H1696]] falsehood; [[H7723]] he gathers [[H6908]] slander [[H205]] in his heart; [[H3820]] he goes [[H3318]] out [[H2351]] and spreads it abroad. [[H1696]]

###### 7
All [[H3605]] who hate [[H8130]] me [[H5921]] whisper [[H3907]] against me; [[H5921]] they imagine [[H2803]] the worst [[H7451]] for me: 

###### 8
“A vile [[H1100]] disease [[H1697]] has been poured [[H3332]] into him;  he will never [[H3808]] get up [[H6965]] from where [[H834]] he lies!” [[H7901]]

###### 9
Even [[H1571]] my close friend, [[H376]] whom [[H834]] I trusted, [[H982]] he who shared [[H398]] my bread, [[H3899]] has lifted up [[H1431]] [his] heel [[H6119]] against me. [[H5921]]

###### 10
But You, [[H859]] O LORD, [[H3069]] be gracious to me [[H2603]] and raise me up, [[H6965]] that I may repay [[H7999]] them. [[H1992]]

###### 11
By this [[H2063]] I know [[H3045]] You delight [[H2654]] in me,  for [[H3588]] my enemy [[H341]] does not [[H3808]] triumph [[H7321]] over me. [[H5921]]

###### 12
In my [[H589]] integrity [[H8537]] You uphold [[H8551]] me  and set me [[H5324]] in Your presence [[H6440]] forever. [[H5769]]

###### 13
Blessed be [[H1288]] the LORD, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] from everlasting [[H5769]] to [[H5704]] everlasting. [[H5769]] Amen [[H543]] and Amen. [[H543]]
