[[Psalms 67|←]] • [[Psalms 69|→]]

---

### 1
For the choirmaster. [[H5329]] A Psalm [[H4210]] Of David. [[H1732]] A Song. [[H7892]] God [[H430]] arises. [[H6965]] His enemies [[H341]] are scattered, [[H6327]] and those who hate [[H8130]] Him flee [[H5127]] His presence. [[H6440]]

### 2
As smoke [[H6227]] is blown away, [[H5086]] You will drive [them] out; [[H5086]] as wax [[H1749]] melts [[H4549]] before [[H6440]] the fire, [[H784]] the wicked [[H7563]] will perish [[H6]] in the presence [[H6440]] of God. [[H430]]

### 3
But the righteous [[H6662]] will be glad [[H8055]] [and] rejoice [[H5970]] before [[H6440]] God; [[H430]] they will celebrate [[H7797]] with joy. [[H8057]]

### 4
Sing [[H7891]] to God! [[H430]] Sing praises [[H2167]] to His name. [[H8034]] Exalt [[H5549]] the One who rides [[H7392]] on the clouds— [[H6160]] His name [[H8034]] is the LORD— [[H3050]] and rejoice [[H5937]] before Him. [[H6440]]

### 5
A father [[H1]] of the fatherless, [[H3490]] and a defender [[H1781]] of the widows, [[H490]] [is] God [[H430]] in His holy [[H6944]] habitation. [[H4583]]

### 6
God [[H430]] settles [[H3427]] the lonely [[H3173]] in families; [[H1004]] He leads [[H3318]] the prisoners {out} [[H615]] to prosperity, [[H3574]] but [[H389]] the rebellious [[H5637]] dwell [[H7931]] in a sun-scorched [land]. [[H6707]]

### 7
O God, [[H430]] when You went out [[H3318]] before [[H6440]] Your people, [[H5971]] when You marched [[H6805]] through the wasteland, [[H3452]] Selah [[H5542]]

### 8
the earth [[H776]] shook [[H7493]] and [[H637]] the heavens [[H8064]] poured down [rain] [[H5197]] before [[H6440]] God, [[H430]] the One [[H2088]] [on] Sinai, [[H5514]] before [[H6440]] God, [[H430]] the God [[H430]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

### 9
You sent [[H5130]] abundant [[H5071]] rain, [[H1653]] O God; [[H430]] You [[H859]] refreshed [[H3559]] Your weary [[H3811]] inheritance. [[H5159]]

### 10
Your flock [[H2416]] settled [[H3427]] therein;  O God, [[H430]] from Your bounty [[H2896]] You provided [[H3559]] for the poor. [[H6041]]

### 11
The Lord [[H136]] gives [[H5414]] the command; [[H562]] a great [[H7227]] company [[H6635]] of women proclaim [it]: [[H1319]]

### 12
“Kings [[H4428]] [and their] armies [[H6635]] flee [[H5074]] in haste; [[H5074]] she who waits [[H5116]] at home [[H1004]] will divide [[H2505]] the plunder. [[H7998]]

### 13
Though [[H518]] you lie down [[H7901]] among [[H996]] the sheepfolds, [[H8240]] the wings [[H3671]] of the dove [[H3123]] are covered [[H2645]] with silver, [[H3701]] and her feathers [[H84]] with shimmering [[H3422]] gold.” [[H2742]]

### 14
When the Almighty [[H7706]] scattered [[H6566]] the kings [[H4428]] in [the land]  it was like the snow falling [[H7949]] on Zalmon. [[H6756]]

### 15
A mountain [[H2022]] of God [[H430]] [is] the hill [[H2022]] of Bashan; [[H1316]] a mount [[H2022]] of many peaks [[H1386]] [is] Mount [[H2022]] Bashan. [[H1316]]

### 16
Why [[H4100]] do you gaze in envy, [[H7520]] O mountains [[H2022]] of many peaks? [[H1386]] [This is] the mountain [[H2022]] God [[H430]] chose [[H2530]] for [His] dwelling, [[H3427]] where the LORD [[H3068]] will surely [[H637]] dwell [[H7931]] forever. [[H5331]]

### 17
The chariots [[H7393]] of God [[H430]] [are] tens of thousands— [[H7239]] thousands [[H505]] of thousands [are they]; [[H8136]] the Lord [[H136]] [is] in  His sanctuary [[H6944]] [as He was at] Sinai. [[H5514]]

### 18
You have ascended [[H5927]] on high; [[H4791]] You have led captives away. [[H7628]] You have received [[H3947]] gifts [[H4979]] from men, [[H120]] even [[H637]] [from] the rebellious, [[H5637]] that the LORD [[H3050]] God [[H430]] may dwell [there]. [[H7931]]

### 19
Blessed [be] [[H1288]] the Lord, [[H136]] [who] daily [[H3117]] bears our burden, [[H6006]] the God [[H410]] of our salvation. [[H3444]] Selah [[H5542]]

### 20
Our God [[H410]] [is] a God [[H410]] of deliverance; [[H4190]] the Lord [[H136]] GOD [[H3069]] [is our] rescuer [[H8444]] from death. [[H4194]]

### 21
Surely [[H389]] God [[H430]] will crush [[H4272]] the heads [[H7218]] of His enemies, [[H341]] the hairy [[H8181]] crowns [[H6936]] of those who persist [[H1980]] in guilty ways. [[H817]]

### 22
The Lord [[H136]] said, [[H559]] “I will retrieve [them] [[H7725]] from Bashan, [[H1316]] I will bring [them] up [[H7725]] from the depths [[H4688]] of the sea, [[H3220]]

### 23
that [[H4616]] your foot [[H7272]] may be dipped [[H4272]] in the blood [[H1818]] of [your] foes, [[H341]] the tongues [[H3956]] of your dogs [[H3611]] in [the same].” [[H4480]]

### 24
They have seen [[H7200]] Your procession, [[H1979]] O God— [[H430]] the march [[H1979]] of my God [[H410]] [and] King [[H4428]] into the sanctuary. [[H6944]]

### 25
The singers [[H7891]] lead the way, [[H6923]] the musicians [[H5059]] [follow] after, [[H310]] among [[H8432]] the maidens [[H5959]] playing tambourines. [[H8608]]

### 26
Bless [[H1288]] God [[H430]] in the great congregation, [[H4721]] [bless] the Lord [[H3068]] from the fountain [[H4726]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

### 27
There [is] [[H8033]] Benjamin, [[H1144]] the youngest, [[H6810]] ruling them, [[H7287]] the princes [[H8269]] of Judah [[H3063]] [in] their company, [[H7277]] the princes [[H8269]] of Zebulun [[H2074]] [and] [[H8269]] of Naphtali. [[H5321]]

### 28
Summon [[H6680]] Your power, [[H5797]] O God; [[H430]] show Your strength, [[H5810]] O God, [[H430]] which [[H2098]] You have exerted [[H6466]] on our behalf. 

### 29
Because of Your temple [[H1964]] at [[H5921]] Jerusalem [[H3389]] kings [[H4428]] will bear [[H2986]] you  gifts. [[H7862]]

### 30
Rebuke [[H1605]] the beast [[H2416]] in the reeds, [[H7070]] the herd [[H5712]] of bulls [[H47]] among the calves [[H5695]] of the nations, [[H5971]] [until] it submits, [[H7511]] [bringing] bars [[H7518]] of silver. [[H3701]] Scatter [[H967]] the nations [[H5971]] [who] delight [[H2654]] in war. [[H7128]]

### 31
Envoys [[H2831]] will arrive [[H857]] from [[H4480]] Egypt; [[H4714]] Cush [[H3568]] will stretch out [[H7323]] her hands [[H3027]] to God. [[H430]]

### 32
Sing [[H7891]] to God, [[H430]] O kingdoms [[H4467]] of the earth; [[H776]] sing praises [[H2167]] to the Lord, [[H136]] Selah [[H5542]]

### 33
to Him who rides [[H7392]] upon the highest [[H8064]] heavens [[H8064]] of old; [[H6924]] behold, [[H2005]] {His} mighty [[H5797]] voice [[H6963]] resounds. [[H5414]]

### 34
Ascribe [[H5414]] the power [[H5797]] to God, [[H430]] whose majesty [[H1346]] [is] over [[H5921]] Israel, [[H3478]] whose strength [[H5797]] [is] in the skies. [[H7834]]

### 35
O God, [[H430]] [You are] awesome [[H3372]] in Your sanctuary; [[H4720]] the God [[H410]] of Israel [[H3478]] Himself [[H1931]] gives [[H5414]] strength [[H5797]] and power [[H8592]] to [His] people. [[H5971]] Blessed [[H1288]] [be] God! [[H430]]
