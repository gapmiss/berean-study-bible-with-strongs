[[Psalms 44|←]] • [[Psalms 46|→]]

---

###### 1
For the choirmaster. [[H5329]] To the tune of [[H5921]] “The Lilies.” [[H7799]] A Maskil [[H4905]] of the sons [[H1121]] of Korah. [[H7141]] A love [[H3039]] song. [[H7892]] My heart [[H3820]] is stirred [[H7370]] by a noble [[H2896]] theme [[H1697]] as I [[H589]] recite [[H559]] my verses [[H4639]] to the king; [[H4428]] my tongue [[H3956]] is the pen [[H5842]] of a skillful [[H4106]] writer. [[H5608]]

###### 2
You are the most handsome [[H3302]] of men; [[H1121]] grace [[H2580]] has anointed [[H3332]] your lips, [[H8193]] since [[H5921]] God [[H430]] has blessed you forever. [[H1288]]

###### 3
Strap [[H2296]] your sword [[H2719]] at [[H5921]] your side, [[H3409]] O mighty warrior; [[H1368]] appear in your majesty [[H1935]] and splendor. [[H1926]]

###### 4
In your splendor [[H1926]] ride forth [[H7392]] in victory [[H6743]] on [[H5921]] behalf [[H1697]] of truth [[H571]] and humility [[H6037]] and justice; [[H6664]] may your right hand [[H3225]] show [[H3384]] your awesome deeds. [[H3372]]

###### 5
Your arrows [[H2671]] pierce [[H8150]] the hearts [[H3820]] of the king’s [[H4428]] foes; [[H341]] the nations [[H5971]] fall [[H5307]] beneath your feet. [[H8478]]

###### 6
Your throne, [[H3678]] O God, [[H430]] [endures] forever [[H5769]] and ever, [[H5703]] [and] [[H7626]] justice [[H4334]] [is] the scepter [[H7626]] of Your kingdom. [[H4438]]

###### 7
You have loved [[H157]] righteousness [[H6664]] and hated [[H8130]] wickedness; [[H7562]] therefore [[H5921]] God, [[H430]] your God, [[H430]] [has placed you above] your companions [[H2270]] by anointing you [[H4886]] with the oil [[H8081]] of joy. [[H8342]]

###### 8
All [[H3605]] your garments [[H899]] [are fragrant with] myrrh [[H4753]] and aloes [[H174]] and cassia; [[H7102]] from [[H4480]] palaces [[H1964]] of ivory [[H8127]] the harps [[H4482]] make you glad. [[H8055]]

###### 9
The daughters [[H1323]] of kings [[H4428]] are among your honored women; [[H3368]] the queen [[H7694]] stands [[H5324]] at your right hand, [[H3225]] adorned with the gold [[H3800]] of Ophir. [[H211]]

###### 10
Listen, [[H8085]] O daughter, [[H1323]] observe [[H7200]] and incline [[H5186]] your ear: [[H241]] Forget [[H7911]] your people [[H5971]] and your father’s [[H1]] house, [[H1004]]

###### 11
and the king [[H4428]] will desire [[H183]] your beauty; [[H3308]] bow [[H7812]] to him,  for [[H3588]] he [[H1931]] is your lord. [[H113]]

###### 12
The daughter [[H1323]] of Tyre [[H6865]] [will come] with a gift; [[H4503]] men [[H5971]] of wealth [[H6223]] will seek [[H2470]] your favor. [[H6440]]

###### 13
All [[H3605]] glorious [[H3520]] is the princess [[H1323]] in [[H6441]] her chamber, [[H4428]] her gown [[H3830]] embroidered [[H4865]] with gold. [[H2091]]

###### 14
In colorful garments [[H7553]] she is led [[H2986]] to the king; [[H4428]] her virgin [[H1330]] companions [[H7464]] are brought [[H935]] before you. 

###### 15
They are led in [[H2986]] with joy [[H8057]] and gladness; [[H1524]] they enter [[H935]] the palace [[H1964]] of the king. [[H4428]]

###### 16
Your sons [[H1121]] will succeed [[H8478]] your fathers; [[H1]] you will make [[H7896]] them princes [[H8269]] throughout [[H3605]] the land. [[H776]]

###### 17
I will commemorate [[H2142]] your name [[H8034]] through all [[H3605]] generations; [[H1755]] therefore [[H5921]] the nations [[H5971]] will praise you [[H3034]] forever [[H5769]] and ever. [[H5703]]
