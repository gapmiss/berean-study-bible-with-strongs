### 1
A Shiggaion [[H7692]] of David, [[H1732]] which [[H834]] he sang [[H7891]] to the LORD [[H3068]] about [[H5921]] Cush, [[H3568]] a Benjamite. [[H1145]] O LORD [[H3068]] my God, [[H430]] I take refuge in You; [[H2620]] save me [[H3467]] and deliver me [[H5337]] from all [[H3605]] my pursuers, [[H7291]]

### 2
or [[H6435]] they will shred [[H2963]] my soul [[H5315]] like a lion, [[H738]] and tear me to pieces [[H6561]] with no one [[H369]] to rescue me. [[H5337]]

### 3
O LORD [[H3068]] my God, [[H430]] if [[H518]] I have done [[H6213]] this, [[H2063]] if [[H518]] injustice [[H5766]] is [[H3426]] on my hands, [[H3709]]

### 4
if [[H518]] I have rewarded [[H1580]] my ally [[H7999]] with evil, [[H7451]] if I have plundered [[H2502]] my foe [[H6887]] without cause, [[H7387]]

### 5
then may my enemy [[H341]] pursue [[H7291]] and overtake [[H5381]] me; [[H5315]] may he trample [[H7429]] me [[H2416]] to the ground [[H776]] and leave [[H7931]] my honor [[H3519]] in the dust. [[H6083]] Selah [[H5542]]

### 6
Arise, [[H6965]] O LORD, [[H3068]] in Your anger; [[H639]] rise up [[H5375]] against the fury [[H5678]] of my enemies. [[H6887]] Awake, [[H5782]] my God, [[H410]] and ordain [[H6680]] judgment. [[H4941]]

### 7
Let the assembled [[H5712]] peoples [[H3816]] encompass You; [[H5437]] take Your seat [[H7725]] over them [[H5921]] on high. [[H4791]]

### 8
The LORD [[H3068]] judges [[H1777]] the peoples; [[H5971]] vindicate me, [[H8199]] O LORD, [[H3068]] according to my righteousness [[H6664]] and integrity. [[H8537]]

### 9
Put an end [[H1584]] to the evil [[H7451]] of the wicked, [[H7563]] but establish [[H3559]] the righteous, [[H6662]] O [[H4994]] righteous [[H6662]] God [[H430]] who searches [[H974]] hearts [[H3826]] and minds. [[H3629]]

### 10
My shield [[H4043]] is with [[H5921]] God, [[H430]] who saves [[H3467]] the upright [[H3477]] in heart. [[H3820]]

### 11
God [[H430]] is a righteous [[H6662]] judge [[H8199]] and a God [[H410]] who feels indignation [[H2194]] each [[H3605]] day. [[H3117]]

### 12
If [[H518]] one does not [[H3808]] repent, [[H7725]] God will sharpen [[H3913]] His sword; [[H2719]] He has bent [[H1869]] and strung [[H3559]] His bow. [[H7198]]

### 13
He has prepared [[H3559]] His deadly [[H4194]] weapons; [[H3627]] He ordains [[H6466]] His arrows [[H2671]] with fire. [[H1814]]

### 14
Behold, [[H2009]] [the wicked man] travails [[H2254]] with evil; [[H205]] he conceives [[H2029]] trouble [[H5999]] and births [[H3205]] falsehood. [[H8267]]

### 15
He has dug [[H3738]] a hole [[H953]] and hollowed it out; [[H2658]] he has fallen [[H5307]] into the pit [[H7845]] of his making. [[H6466]]

### 16
His trouble [[H5999]] recoils [[H7725]] on himself, [[H7218]] and his violence [[H2555]] falls [[H3381]] on [[H5921]] his own head. [[H6936]]

### 17
I will thank [[H3034]] the LORD [[H3068]] for His righteousness [[H6664]] and sing praise [[H2167]] to the name [[H8034]] of the LORD [[H3068]] Most High. [[H5945]]
