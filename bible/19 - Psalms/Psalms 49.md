### 1
For the choirmaster. [[H5329]] A Psalm [[H4210]] of the sons [[H1121]] of Korah. [[H7141]] Hear [[H8085]] this, [[H2063]] all you peoples; [[H3605]] listen, [[H238]] all [[H3605]] inhabitants [[H3427]] of the world, [[H2465]]

### 2
both [[H1571]] low and high, [[H1121]] rich [[H6223]] and poor [[H34]] alike. [[H3162]]

### 3
My mouth [[H6310]] will impart [[H1696]] wisdom, [[H2454]] and the meditation [[H1900]] of my heart [[H3820]] will bring understanding. [[H8394]]

### 4
I will incline [[H5186]] my ear [[H241]] to a proverb; [[H4912]] I will express [[H6605]] my riddle [[H2420]] with the harp: [[H3658]]

### 5
Why [[H4100]] should I fear [[H3372]] in times [[H3117]] of trouble, [[H7451]] when wicked [[H5771]] usurpers [[H6120]] surround me? [[H5437]]

### 6
They trust [[H982]] in [[H5921]] their wealth [[H2428]] and boast [[H1984]] in great [[H7230]] riches. [[H6239]]

### 7
No [[H3808]] man [[H251]] can possibly [[H6299]] redeem [[H6299]] his brother [[H376]] or [[H3808]] pay [[H5414]] his ransom [[H3724]] to God. [[H430]]

### 8
For the redemption [[H6306]] of his soul [[H5315]] is costly, [[H3365]] and never [[H5769]] can payment suffice, [[H2308]]

### 9
that he should live on [[H2421]] forever [[H5331]] and not [[H3808]] see [[H7200]] decay. [[H7845]]

### 10
For [[H3588]] it is clear [[H7200]] that wise [[H2450]] men die, [[H4191]] and the foolish [[H3684]] and the senseless [[H1198]] both [[H3162]] perish [[H6]] and leave [[H5800]] their wealth [[H2428]] to others. [[H312]]

### 11
Their graves [[H7130]] are their eternal [[H5769]] homes— [[H1004]] their dwellings [[H4908]] for endless generations— [[H1755]] even though [[H5921]] [their] lands [[H127]] were their namesakes. [[H7121]]

### 12
But a man, [[H120]] despite his wealth, [[H3366]] cannot [[H1077]] endure; [[H3885]] he is like [[H4911]] the beasts [[H929]] that perish. [[H1820]]

### 13
This [[H2088]] is the fate [[H1870]] of the self-confident [[H3689]] and their followers [[H310]] who endorse [[H7521]] their sayings. [[H6310]] Selah [[H5542]]

### 14
Like sheep [[H6629]] they are destined [[H8371]] for Sheol. [[H7585]] Death [[H4194]] will be their shepherd. [[H7462]] The upright [[H3477]] will rule them [[H7287]] in  the morning, [[H1242]] and their form [[H6736]] will decay [[H1086]] in Sheol, [[H7585]] far from their lofty abode. [[H2073]]

### 15
But [[H389]] God [[H430]] will redeem [[H6299]] my life [[H5315]] from [[H3027]] Sheol, [[H7585]] for [[H3588]] He will surely take me to Himself. [[H3947]] Selah [[H5542]]

### 16
Do not [[H408]] be amazed [[H3372]] when [[H3588]] a man [[H376]] grows rich, [[H6238]] when [[H3588]] the splendor [[H3519]] of his house [[H1004]] increases. [[H7235]]

### 17
For [[H3588]] when he dies, [[H4194]] he will carry [[H3947]] nothing away; [[H3808]] his abundance [[H3519]] will not [[H3808]] follow [[H310]] him down. [[H3381]]

### 18
Though [[H3588]] in his lifetime [[H2416]] he blesses [[H1288]] his soul— [[H5315]] and men praise [[H3034]] you when [[H3588]] you prosper— [[H3190]]

### 19
he will join [[H935]] the generation [[H1755]] of his fathers, [[H1]] who will never [[H5704]] see [[H7200]] the light of day. [[H216]]

### 20
A man [[H120]] who has riches [[H3366]] without [[H3808]] understanding [[H995]] is like [[H4911]] the beasts [[H929]] that perish. [[H1820]]
