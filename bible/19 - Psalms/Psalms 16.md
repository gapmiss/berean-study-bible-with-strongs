### 1
A Miktam [[H4387]] of David. [[H1732]] Preserve me, [[H8104]] O God, [[H410]] for [[H3588]] in You  I take refuge. [[H2620]]

### 2
I said [[H559]] to the LORD, [[H3068]] “You [[H859]] are my Lord; [[H136]] apart from You [[H5921]] I have no [[H1077]] good thing.” [[H2896]]

### 3
As for the saints [[H6918]] in the land, [[H776]] they [[H1992]] are the excellence [[H117]] in whom all [[H3605]] my delight [[H2656]] resides. 

### 4
Sorrows [[H6094]] will multiply [[H7235]] to those who chase [[H4116]] other gods. [[H312]] I will not [[H1077]] pour out [[H5258]] their libations [[H5262]] of blood, [[H1818]] or [[H1077]] speak [[H5375]] their names [[H8034]] with [[H5921]] my lips. [[H8193]]

### 5
The LORD [[H3068]] [is] my chosen portion [[H4490]] and my cup; [[H3563]] You [[H859]] have made [[H8551]] my lot {secure}. [[H1486]]

### 6
The lines [[H2256]] of my {boundary}  have fallen [[H5307]] in pleasant places; [[H5273]] surely [[H637]] my [[H5921]] inheritance [[H5159]] is delightful. [[H8231]]

### 7
I will bless [[H1288]] the LORD [[H3068]] who [[H834]] counsels me; [[H3289]] even [[H637]] at night [[H3915]] my conscience [[H3629]] instructs me. [[H3256]]

### 8
I have set [[H7737]] the LORD [[H3068]] always [[H8548]] before me. [[H5048]] Because [[H3588]] He is at my right hand, [[H3225]] I will not [[H1077]] be shaken. [[H4131]]

### 9
Therefore [[H3651]] my heart [[H3820]] is glad [[H8055]] and my tongue [[H3519]] rejoices; [[H1523]] my body [[H1320]] also [[H637]] will dwell [[H7931]] securely. [[H983]]

### 10
For [[H3588]] You will not [[H3808]] abandon [[H5800]] my soul [[H5315]] to Sheol, [[H7585]] nor will You [[H3808]] let [[H5414]] Your Holy One [[H2623]] see [[H7200]] decay. [[H7845]]

### 11
You have made known to me [[H3045]] the path [[H734]] of life; [[H2416]] You will fill me [[H7648]] with joy [[H8057]] in Your presence [[H6440]] with eternal [[H5331]] pleasures [[H5273]] at Your right hand. [[H3225]]
