###### 1
For the choirmaster. [[H5329]] To the tune of [[H5921]] “A Dove [[H3123]] on Distant [[H7350]] Oaks.” [[H482]] A Miktam [[H4387]] of David, [[H1732]] when the Philistines [[H6430]] seized [[H270]] him in Gath. [[H1661]] Be merciful to me, [[H2603]] O God, [[H430]] for [[H3588]] men [[H582]] are hounding me; [[H7602]] all [[H3605]] day long [[H3117]] they press [[H3905]] their attack. [[H3898]]

###### 2
My enemies [[H8324]] pursue me [[H7602]] all [[H3605]] day long, [[H3117]] for [[H3588]] many [[H7227]] proudly [[H4791]] assail [[H3898]] me. 

###### 3
When [[H3117]] I am afraid, [[H3372]] I [[H589]] will trust [[H982]] in You. [[H413]]

###### 4
In God, [[H430]] whose word [[H1697]] I praise, [[H1984]] in God [[H430]] I trust; [[H982]] I will not [[H3808]] be afraid. [[H3372]] What [[H4100]] can man [[H1320]] do [[H6213]] to me? 

###### 5
All day long [[H3605]] they twist [[H6087]] my words; [[H1697]] all [[H3605]] their thoughts [[H4284]] [are] of [[H5921]] my demise. [[H7451]]

###### 6
They conspire, [[H1481]] they lurk, [[H6845]] they [[H1992]] watch [[H8104]] my steps, [[H6119]] while [[H834]] they wait [[H6960]] to take my life. [[H5315]]

###### 7
In spite of [[H5921]] such sin, [[H205]] {shall} they escape? [[H6405]] In Your anger, [[H639]] O God, [[H430]] cast down [[H3381]] the nations. [[H5971]]

###### 8
You [[H859]] have taken account [[H5608]] of my wanderings; [[H5112]] You have put [[H7760]] my tears [[H1832]] in Your bottle. [[H4997]] Are they not [[H3808]] in Your book? [[H5612]]

###### 9
Then [[H227]] my enemies [[H341]] will retreat [[H7725]] on the day [[H3117]] I cry for help. [[H7121]] By this [[H2088]] I will know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] God [is] [[H430]] on my side. 

###### 10
In God, [[H430]] whose word [[H1697]] I praise, [[H1984]] in the LORD, [[H3068]] whose word [[H1697]] I praise, [[H1984]]

###### 11
in God [[H430]] I trust; [[H982]] I will not [[H3808]] be afraid. [[H3372]] What [[H4100]] can man [[H120]] do to me? [[H6213]]

###### 12
Your vows [[H5088]] [are] upon me, [[H5921]] O God; [[H430]] I will render [[H7999]] thank offerings [[H8426]] to You. 

###### 13
For [[H3588]] You have delivered [[H5337]] my soul [[H5315]] from death, [[H4194]] and my feet [[H7272]] from stumbling, [[H1762]] that I may walk [[H1980]] before [[H6440]] God [[H430]] in the light [[H216]] of life. [[H2416]]
