### 1
Now [[G1161]] there was [[G1510]] a man [[G444]] of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] Pharisees [[G5330]] named [[G3686]] Nicodemus, [[G3530]] a leader [[G758]] of the [[G3588]] Jews. [[G2453]]

### 2
He [[G3778]] came [[G2064]] to [[G4314]] [Jesus] [[G846]] at night [[G3571]] and [[G2532]] said, [[G2036]] “Rabbi, [[G4461]] we know [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] [You are] a teacher [[G1320]] who has come [[G2064]] from [[G575]] God. [[G2316]] For [[G1063]] no one [[G3762]] could [[G1410]] perform [[G4160]] [the] [[G3778]] signs [[G4592]] You [[G4771]] are doing [[G4160]] if [[G1437]] God [[G2316]] were [[G1510]] not [[G3361]] with [[G3326]] him. [[G846]]

### 3
Jesus [[G2424]] replied, [[G611]] “Truly, [[G281]] truly, [[G281]] I tell [[G3004]] you, [[G4771]] no [[G3756]] one [[G5100]] can [[G1410]] see [[G3708]] the [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] of God [[G2316]] unless [[G1437]] he is born [[G1080]] again.” [[G509]]

### 4
“How [[G4459]] can [[G1410]] a man [[G444]] be born [[G1080]] when he is [[G1510]] old?” [[G1088]] Nicodemus [[G3530]] asked. [[G3004]] “Can he [[G1410]] enter [[G1525]] his [[G846]] mother’s [[G3384]] womb [[G2836]] a second time [[G1208]] to be born?” [[G1080]]

### 5
Jesus [[G2424]] answered,, [[G611]] “Truly, [[G281]] truly, [[G281]] I tell [[G3004]] you, [[G4771]] no [[G3756]] one [[G5100]] can [[G1410]] enter [[G1525]] the [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] of God [[G2316]] unless [[G1437]] he is born [[G1080]] of [[G1537]] water [[G5204]] and [[G2532]] [the] Spirit. [[G4151]]

### 6
Flesh [[G4561]] is [[G1510]] born [[G1080]] of [[G1537]] flesh, [[G4561]] [but] [[G2532]] spirit [[G4151]] is [[G1510]] born [[G1080]] of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] Spirit. [[G4151]]

### 7
Do not be amazed [[G2296]] that [[G3754]] I said, [[G2036]] ‘You [[G4771]] must [[G1163]] be born [[G1080]] again.’ [[G509]]

### 8
The [[G3588]] wind [[G4151]] blows [[G4154]] where [[G3699]] it wishes. [[G2309]] You hear [[G191]] its [[G846]] sound, [[G5456]] but [[G235]] you do not know [[G1492]] where [[G4159]] it comes {from} [[G2064]] [or] [[G2532]] where [[G4226]] it is going. [[G5217]] So [[G3779]] it is [[G1510]] with everyone [[G3956]] born [[G1080]] of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] Spirit. [[G4151]]

### 9
“How [[G4459]] can [[G1410]] this [[G3778]] be?” [[G1096]] Nicodemus [[G3530]] asked. [[G611]]

### 10
“You [[G4771]] are [[G1510]] Israel’s [[G2474]] teacher,” [[G1320]] said [[G611]] Jesus, [[G2424]] “and [[G2532]] you do not understand [[G1097]] these things? [[G3778]]

### 11
Truly, [[G281]] truly, [[G281]] I tell [[G3004]] you, [[G4771]] we speak [[G2980]] of what [[G3739]] we know, [[G1492]] and [[G2532]] we testify [[G3140]] to what [[G3739]] we have seen, [[G3708]] and yet [[G2532]] you people do not accept [[G2983]] our [[G1473]] testimony. [[G3141]]

### 12
If [[G1487]] I have told [[G2036]] you {about} [[G4771]] earthly [[G1919]] things [[G3588]] and [[G2532]] you do not believe, [[G4100]] how [[G4459]] will you believe [[G4100]] if [[G1437]] I tell [[G2036]] you {about} [[G4771]] heavenly [[G2032]] things? [[G3588]]

### 13
No one [[G3762]] has ascended [[G305]] into [[G1519]] heaven [[G3772]] except [[G1487]] the [One who] [[G3588]] descended [[G2597]] from [[G1537]] heaven— [[G3772]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of Man. [[G444]]

### 14
Just [[G2532]] as [[G2531]] Moses [[G3475]] lifted up [[G5312]] the [[G3588]] snake [[G3789]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] wilderness, [[G2048]] so [[G3779]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of Man [[G444]] must [[G1163]] be lifted up, [[G5312]]

### 15
that [[G2443]] everyone [[G3956]] who [[G3588]] believes [[G4100]] in [[G1722]] Him [[G846]] may have [[G2192]] eternal [[G166]] life. [[G2222]]

### 16
For [[G1063]] God [[G2316]] so [[G3779]] loved [[G25]] the [[G3588]] world [[G2889]] that [[G5620]] He gave [[G1325]] [His] [[G3588]] one and only [[G3439]] Son, [[G5207]] that [[G2443]] everyone [[G3956]] who [[G3588]] believes [[G4100]] in [[G1519]] Him [[G846]] shall not perish [[G622]] but [[G235]] have [[G2192]] eternal [[G166]] life. [[G2222]]

### 17
For [[G1063]] God [[G2316]] {did} not [[G3756]] send [[G649]] His Son [[G5207]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] world [[G2889]] to [[G2443]] condemn [[G2919]] the [[G3588]] world, [[G2889]] but [[G235]] to [[G2443]] save [[G4982]] the [[G3588]] world [[G2889]] through [[G1223]] Him. [[G846]]

### 18
Whoever [[G3588]] believes [[G4100]] in [[G1519]] Him [[G846]] is not condemned, [[G2919]] but [[G1161]] whoever [[G3588]] does not believe [[G4100]] has already been condemned, [[G2919]] because [[G3754]] he has not believed [[G4100]] in [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] name [[G3686]] of God’s [[G2316]] one and only [[G3439]] Son. [[G5207]]

### 19
And [[G1161]] this [[G3778]] is [[G1510]] the [[G3588]] verdict: [[G2920]] The [[G3588]] Light [[G5457]] has come [[G2064]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] world, [[G2889]] but [[G2532]] men [[G444]] loved [[G25]] the [[G3588]] darkness [[G4655]] rather [[G3123]] than [[G2228]] the [[G3588]] Light, [[G5457]] because [[G1063]] their [[G846]] deeds [[G2041]] were [[G1510]] evil. [[G4190]]

### 20
Everyone [[G3956]] who [[G3588]] does [[G4238]] evil [[G5337]] hates [[G3404]] the [[G3588]] Light, [[G5457]] and [[G2532]] {does} not [[G3756]] come [[G2064]] into [[G4314]] the [[G3588]] Light [[G5457]] for fear that [[G2443]] his [[G846]] deeds [[G2041]] will be exposed. [[G1651]]

### 21
But [[G1161]] whoever [[G3588]] practices [[G4160]] the [[G3588]] truth [[G225]] comes [[G2064]] into [[G4314]] the [[G3588]] Light, [[G5457]] so that [[G2443]] it may be seen clearly [[G5319]] that [[G3754]] [what] he [[G846]] has done [[G2041]] has been [[G1510]] accomplished [[G2038]] in [[G1722]] God.” [[G2316]]

### 22
After [[G3326]] this, [[G3778]] Jesus [[G2424]] and [[G2532]] His [[G846]] disciples [[G3101]] went [[G2064]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] Judean [[G2453]] countryside, [[G1093]] [where] [[G1563]] He spent some time [[G1304]] with [[G3326]] them [[G846]] and [[G2532]] baptized. [[G907]]

### 23
Now [[G1161]] John [[G2491]] was [[G1510]] also [[G2532]] baptizing [[G907]] at [[G1722]] Aenon [[G137]] near [[G1451]] Salim, [[G4530]] because [[G3754]] [the] water [[G5204]] was [[G1510]] plentiful [[G4183]] there, [[G1563]] and [[G2532]] [people] kept coming [[G3854]] to be baptized. [[G907]]

### 24
(For [[G1063]] John [[G2491]] {had} not yet [[G3768]] been [[G1510]] thrown [[G906]] into [[G1519]] prison.) [[G5438]]

### 25
A dispute [[G2214]] arose [[G1096]] between [[G1537]] John’s [[G2491]] disciples [[G3101]] [and] [[G3326]] [a certain] Jew [[G2453]] over [the issue of] [[G4012]] ceremonial washing. [[G2512]]

### 26
So [[G2532]] [John’s disciples] came [[G2064]] to [[G4314]] [him] [[G2491]] and [[G2532]] said, [[G2036]] “Look, [[G2400]] Rabbi, [[G4461]] the [One who] [[G3739]] was [[G1510]] with [[G3326]] you [[G4771]] beyond [[G4008]] the [[G3588]] Jordan, [[G2446]] the One [[G3739]] you [[G4771]] testified about— [[G3140]] He [[G3778]] is baptizing, [[G907]] and [[G2532]] everyone [[G3956]] is going [[G2064]] to [[G4314]] Him. [[G846]]

### 27
John [[G2491]] replied, [[G611]] “A man [[G444]] can [[G1410]] receive [[G2983]] only what [[G3761]] is [[G1510]] given [[G1325]] him [[G846]] from [[G1537]] heaven. [[G3772]]

### 28
You [[G4771]] yourselves [[G846]] can testify [[G3140]] that [[G3754]] I said, [[G2036]] ‘I [[G1473]] am [[G1510]] not [[G3756]] the [[G3588]] Christ, [[G5547]] but [[G235]] am [[G1510]] sent [[G649]] ahead of [[G1715]] Him.’ [[G1565]]

### 29
The [[G3588]] bride [[G3565]] belongs to [[G3588]] [the] bridegroom. [[G3566]] The [[G3588]] friend [[G5384]] of the [[G3588]] bridegroom [[G3566]] stands [[G2476]] and [[G2532]] listens for [[G191]] him, [[G846]] [and] is overjoyed [[G5463]] [to hear] [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] bridegroom’s [[G3566]] voice. [[G5456]] That [[G3767]] joy [[G5479]] [is] mine, [[G1699]] [and] it is now complete. [[G4137]]

### 30
He [[G1565]] must [[G1163]] increase; [[G837]] I [[G1473]] [must] decrease. [[G1642]]

### 31
The [One who] [[G3588]] comes [[G2064]] from above [[G509]] is [[G1510]] above [[G1883]] all. [[G3956]] The [one who] [[G3588]] is [[G1510]] from [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] earth [[G1093]] belongs [[G1510]] to [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] earth [[G1093]] and [[G2532]] speaks [as one] [[G2980]] from [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] earth. [[G1093]] The [One who] [[G3588]] comes [[G2064]] from [[G1537]] heaven [[G3772]] is [[G1510]] above [[G1883]] all. [[G3956]]

### 32
He testifies [[G3140]] to [[G3778]] what [[G3739]] He has seen [[G3708]] and [[G2532]] heard, [[G191]] yet [[G2532]] no one [[G3762]] accepts [[G2983]] His [[G846]] testimony. [[G3141]]

### 33
Whoever [[G3588]] accepts [[G2983]] His [[G846]] testimony [[G3141]] has certified [[G4972]] that [[G3754]] God [[G2316]] is [[G1510]] truthful. [[G227]]

### 34
For [[G1063]] the [One] [[G3739]] whom [[G3588]] God [[G2316]] has sent [[G649]] speaks [[G2980]] the [[G3588]] words [[G4487]] of God, [[G2316]] for [[G1063]] [God] gives [[G1325]] the [[G3588]] Spirit [[G4151]] without [[G3756]] limit. [[G3358]]

### 35
The [[G3588]] Father [[G3962]] loves [[G25]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] and [[G2532]] has placed [[G1325]] all things [[G3956]] in [[G1722]] His [[G846]] hands. [[G5495]]

### 36
Whoever [[G3588]] believes [[G4100]] in [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] has [[G2192]] eternal [[G166]] life. [[G2222]] Whoever [[G3588]] rejects [[G544]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] will not see [[G3708]] life. [[G2222]] Instead, [[G235]] the [[G3588]] wrath [[G3709]] of God [[G2316]] remains [[G3306]] on [[G1909]] him. [[G846]]
