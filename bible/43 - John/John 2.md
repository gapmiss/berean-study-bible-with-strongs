### 1
On the [[G3588]] third [[G5154]] day [[G2250]] a wedding [[G1062]] took place [[G1096]] at [[G1722]] Cana [[G2580]] in Galilee. [[G1056]] Jesus’ [[G2424]] mother [[G3384]] was [[G1510]] there, [[G1563]]

### 2
and [[G1161]] Jesus [[G2424]] and [[G2532]] His [[G846]] disciples [[G3101]] had also been invited [[G2564]] to [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] wedding. [[G1062]]

### 3
When [[G2532]] [the] wine [[G3631]] ran out, [[G5302]] Jesus’ [[G2424]] mother [[G3384]] said [[G3004]] to [[G4314]] Him, [[G846]] “They have [[G2192]] no more [[G3756]] wine.” [[G3631]]

### 4
“Woman, [[G1135]] why [does this concern] [[G5101]] us?” [[G1473]] Jesus [[G2424]] replied. [[G3004]] “My [[G1473]] hour [[G5610]] {has} not yet [[G3768]] come.” [[G2240]]

### 5
His [[G846]] mother [[G3384]] said to [[G3004]] the [[G3588]] servants, [[G1249]] “Do [[G4160]] whatever [[G3739]] He tells [[G3004]] you.” [[G4771]]

### 6
Now [[G1161]] six [[G1803]] stone [[G3035]] water jars [[G5201]] had been [[G1510]] set [[G2749]] there [[G1563]] for [[G2596]] the [[G3588]] Jewish [[G2453]] [rites of] purification. [[G2512]] [Each] could hold [[G5562]] from [[G303]] twenty to thirty gallons. [[G1417]]

### 7
Jesus [[G2424]] told [[G3004]] [the servants], [[G846]] “Fill [[G1072]] the [[G3588]] jars [[G5201]] with water.” [[G5204]] So [[G2532]] they filled [[G1072]] them [[G846]] to [[G2193]] [the] brim. [[G507]]

### 8
“Now [[G3568]] draw [some] out,” [[G501]] He said, [[G3004]] “and [[G2532]] take [it] [[G5342]] to the [[G3588]] master of the banquet.” [[G755]] They [did so], [[G5342]]

### 9
and [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] master of the banquet [[G755]] tasted [[G1089]] the [[G3588]] water [[G5204]] that had been turned into [[G1096]] wine. [[G3631]] He did not know [[G1492]] where [[G4159]] it was {from}, [[G1510]] but [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] servants [[G1249]] who [[G3588]] had drawn [[G501]] the [[G3588]] water [[G5204]] knew. [[G1492]] Then [[G3588]] [he] [[G755]] called [[G5455]] the [[G3588]] bridegroom [aside] [[G3566]]

### 10
and [[G2532]] said, [[G3004]] “Everyone [[G3956]] serves [[G5087]] the [[G3588]] fine [[G2570]] wine [[G3631]] first, [[G4412]] and then [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] cheap [wine] [[G1640]] after [[G3752]] [the guests] are drunk. [[G3184]] [But] you [[G4771]] have saved [[G5083]] the [[G3588]] fine [[G2570]] wine [[G3631]] until [[G2193]] now!” [[G737]]

### 11
Jesus [[G2424]] performed [[G4160]] this, [[G3778]] the first [[G746]] of His [[G3588]] signs, [[G4592]] at [[G1722]] Cana [[G2580]] in Galilee. [[G1056]] He thus [[G2532]] revealed [[G5319]] His [[G846]] glory, [[G1391]] and [[G2532]] His [[G846]] disciples [[G3101]] believed [[G4100]] in [[G1519]] Him. [[G846]]

### 12
After [[G3326]] this, [[G3778]] He went down [[G2597]] to [[G1519]] Capernaum [[G2584]] [with] [[G2532]] His [[G846]] mother [[G3384]] and [[G2532]] brothers [[G80]] and [[G2532]] His [[G846]] disciples, [[G3101]] and [[G2532]] they stayed [[G3306]] there [[G1563]] a few [[G4183]] days. [[G2250]]

### 13
When [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] Jewish [[G2453]] Passover [[G3957]] was [[G1510]] near, [[G1451]] Jesus [[G2424]] went up [[G305]] to [[G1519]] Jerusalem. [[G2414]]

### 14
In [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] temple courts [[G2411]] He found [[G2147]] [men] [[G3588]] selling [[G4453]] cattle, [[G1016]] sheep, [[G4263]] and [[G2532]] doves, [[G4058]] and [[G2532]] money changers [[G2773]] seated [at their tables]. [[G2521]]

### 15
[So] [[G2532]] He made [[G4160]] a whip [[G5416]] out of [[G1537]] cords [[G4979]] [and] drove [[G1544]] all [[G3956]] from [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] temple courts, [[G2411]] both [[G5037]] sheep [[G4263]] and [[G2532]] cattle. [[G1016]] He poured out [[G1632]] the [[G3588]] coins [[G2772]] of the [[G3588]] money changers [[G2855]] and [[G2532]] overturned [[G396]] [their] [[G3588]] tables. [[G5132]]

### 16
To those [[G3588]] selling [[G4453]] doves [[G4058]] He said, [[G2036]] “Get [[G142]] these [[G3778]] out of here! [[G1782]] How dare you [[G3361]] turn [[G4160]] My [[G1473]] Father’s [[G3962]] house {into} [[G3624]] a marketplace!” [[G3624]]

### 17
His [[G846]] disciples [[G3101]] remembered [[G3403]] that [[G3754]] it is [[G1510]] written: [[G1125]] “Zeal [[G2205]] for [[G3588]] Your [[G4771]] house [[G3624]] will consume [[G2719]] Me.” [[G1473]]

### 18
On account of this, [[G3767]] the [[G3588]] Jews [[G2453]] demanded, [[G611]] “What [[G5101]] sign [[G4592]] can You show [[G1166]] us [[G1473]] to prove [[G3754]] Your [ authority ] to do [[G4160]] these things?” [[G3778]]

### 19
Jesus [[G2424]] answered, [[G611]] “Destroy [[G3089]] this [[G3778]] temple, [[G3485]] and [[G2532]] in [[G1722]] three [[G5140]] days [[G2250]] I will raise it up again.” [[G1453]]

### 20
“This [[G3778]] temple {took} [[G3485]] forty-six [[G5062]] years [[G2094]] to build,” [[G3618]] the [[G3588]] Jews [[G2453]] replied, [[G2036]] “and [[G2532]] You [[G4771]] are going to raise it up [[G1453]] in [[G1722]] three [[G5140]] days?” [[G2250]]

### 21
But [[G1161]] [Jesus] [[G1565]] was speaking [[G2036]] about [[G4012]] the [[G3588]] temple [[G3485]] [of] His [[G846]] body. [[G4983]]

### 22
After [[G3753]] He was raised [[G1453]] from [[G1537]] [the] dead, [[G3498]] His [[G846]] disciples [[G3101]] remembered [[G3403]] that [[G3754]] He had said [[G2036]] this. [[G3778]] Then [[G2532]] they believed [[G4100]] the [[G3588]] Scripture [[G1124]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] word [[G3056]] that [[G3739]] Jesus [[G2424]] had spoken. [[G2036]]

### 23
While [[G5613]] He was [[G1510]] in [[G1722]] Jerusalem [[G2414]] at [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] Passover [[G3957]] Feast, [[G1859]] many people [[G4183]] saw [[G2334]] [the] [[G846]] signs [[G4592]] He was doing [[G4160]] [and] believed [[G4100]] in [[G1519]] His [[G846]] name. [[G3686]]

### 24
But [[G1161]] Jesus [[G2424]] {did} not [[G3756]] entrust [[G4100]] Himself [[G848]] to them, [[G846]] for [[G1223]] He [[G846]] knew [[G1097]] all [men]. [[G3956]]

### 25
He {did} [[G2192]] not [[G3756]] need [[G5532]] any [[G5100]] testimony [[G3140]] about [[G4012]] man, [[G444]] for [[G1063]] He [[G846]] knew [[G1097]] what [[G5101]] was [[G1510]] in [[G1722]] [a] man. [[G444]]
