###### 1
Then [[G3767]] Pilate [[G4091]] took [[G2983]] Jesus [[G2424]] and [[G2532]] had [Him] flogged. [[G3146]]

###### 2
The [[G3588]] soldiers [[G4757]] twisted together [[G4120]] a crown [[G4735]] of [[G1537]] thorns, [[G173]] put [it] on [[G2007]] His [[G846]] head, [[G2776]] and [[G2532]] dressed [[G4016]] Him [[G846]] in a purple [[G4210]] robe. [[G2440]]

###### 3
And [[G2532]] they went up [[G2064]] to [[G4314]] Him {again and again}, [[G846]] saying, [[G2036]] “Hail, [[G5463]] King [[G935]] of the [[G3588]] Jews!” [[G2453]] and [[G2532]] slapping Him in the face. [[G1325]]

###### 4
[Once] [[G2532]] again [[G3825]] Pilate [[G4091]] came [[G1831]] out [[G1854]] and [[G2532]] said [[G3004]] to [the Jews], [[G846]] “Look, [[G2400]] I am bringing [[G71]] Him [[G846]] out [[G1854]] to you [[G4771]] to [[G2443]] let you know [[G1097]] that [[G3754]] I find [[G2147]] no [[G3762]] basis for a charge [[G156]] against [[G1722]] Him. [[G846]]

###### 5
[When] [[G3767]] Jesus [[G2424]] came [[G1831]] out [[G1854]] wearing [[G5409]] the [[G3588]] crown [[G4735]] of thorns [[G174]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] purple [[G4210]] robe, [[G2440]] [Pilate] said [[G3004]] to them, [[G846]] “[Here is] [[G2400]] the [[G3588]] man!” [[G444]]

###### 6
As soon as [[G3753]] the [[G3588]] chief priests [[G749]] and [[G2532]] officers [[G5257]] saw [[G3708]] Him, [[G846]] they shouted, [[G2905]] “Crucify [Him]! [[G4717]] Crucify [Him]!” [[G4717]] “You take [[G2983]] Him [[G846]] and [[G2532]] crucify [Him],” [[G4717]] Pilate [[G4091]] replied, [[G3004]] “for [[G1063]] I [[G1473]] find [[G2147]] no [[G3756]] basis for a charge [[G156]] against [[G1722]] Him.” [[G846]]

###### 7
“We [[G1473]] have [[G2192]] a law,” [[G3551]] answered [[G611]] the [[G3588]] Jews, [[G2453]] “and [[G2532]] according to [[G2596]] [that] [[G3588]] law [[G3551]] He must [[G3784]] die, [[G599]] because [[G3754]] He declared [[G4160]] Himself {to be} [[G1438]] [the] Son [[G5207]] of God.” [[G2316]]

###### 8
When [[G3753]] Pilate [[G4091]] heard [[G191]] this [[G3778]] statement, [[G3056]] he was even more afraid, [[G5399]]

###### 9
and [[G2532]] he went [[G1525]] back [[G3825]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] Praetorium. [[G4232]] “Where [[G4159]] are [[G1510]] You from?” [[G4771]] he asked. [[G3004]] But [[G1161]] Jesus [[G2424]] gave no [[G1325]] answer. [[G612]]

###### 10
So [[G3767]] Pilate [[G4091]] said [[G3004]] to Him, [[G846]] “Do You refuse to speak [[G2980]] to me? [[G1473]] Do You not know [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] I have [[G2192]] authority [[G1849]] to release [[G630]] You [[G4771]] and [[G2532]] authority [[G1849]] to crucify [[G4717]] You?” [[G4771]]

###### 11
Jesus [[G2424]] answered, [[G611]] “You would have [[G2192]] no [[G3756]] authority [[G1849]] over [[G3762]] Me [[G1473]] if [[G1487]] it were [[G1510]] not [[G3361]] given [[G1325]] to you [[G4771]] from above. [[G509]] Therefore [[G1223]] the [one who] [[G3588]] handed Me over [[G3860]] to you [[G4771]] is {guilty of} [[G2192]] greater [[G3173]] sin.” [[G266]]

###### 12
From then on, [[G1537]] Pilate [[G4091]] tried [[G2212]] to release [[G630]] Him, [[G846]] but [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] Jews [[G2453]] kept shouting, [[G2905]] “If [[G1437]] you release [[G630]] this [man], [[G3778]] you are [[G1510]] no [[G3756]] friend [[G5384]] of Caesar. [[G2541]] Anyone [[G3956]] who [[G3588]] declares [[G4160]] himself [[G1438]] a king [[G935]] is defying [[G483]] Caesar. [[G2541]]

###### 13
[When] [[G3767]] Pilate [[G4091]] heard [[G191]] these [[G3778]] words, [[G3056]] he brought [[G71]] Jesus [[G2424]] out [[G1854]] and [[G2532]] sat [[G2523]] on [[G1909]] [the] judgment seat [[G968]] at [[G1519]] a place [[G5117]] called [[G3004]] [the] Stone Pavement, [[G3038]] [which] [[G1161]] in Aramaic [is] [[G1447]] Gabbatha. [[G1042]]

###### 14
It was [[G1510]] the day of Preparation [[G3904]] for the [[G3588]] Passover, [[G3957]] about [[G5613]] the sixth [[G1623]] hour. [[G5610]] And [[G2532]] [Pilate] said [[G3004]] to the [[G3588]] Jews, [[G2453]] “Here is [[G2400]] your [[G4771]] King!” [[G935]]

###### 15
At this, [[G3767]] they shouted, [[G2905]] “Away [[G142]] with Him! [[G1565]] Away [with Him]! [[G142]] Crucify [[G4717]] Him!” [[G846]] “Shall I crucify [[G4717]] your [[G4771]] King?” [[G935]] Pilate [[G4091]] asked. [[G3004]] “We have [[G2192]] no [[G3756]] king [[G935]] but [[G1487]] Caesar,” [[G2541]] replied [[G611]] the [[G3588]] chief priests. [[G749]]

###### 16
Then [[G3767]] [Pilate] handed [Jesus] over [[G3860]] to [[G2443]] be crucified, [[G4717]] [and] [[G3767]] [the soldiers] took [[G3880]] [Him] {away}. [[G2424]]

###### 17
Carrying [[G941]] [His] own [[G1438]] cross, [[G4716]] He went out [[G1831]] to [[G1519]] [The] Place [[G5117]] of the Skull, [[G2898]] which [[G3739]] in Aramaic [[G1447]] is called [[G3004]] Golgotha. [[G1115]]

###### 18
[There] [[G3699]] they crucified [[G4717]] Him, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] with [[G3326]] Him [[G846]] two [[G1417]] others, [[G243]] [one] on each side, [[G1782]] [with] [[G1161]] Jesus [[G2424]] in the middle. [[G3319]]

###### 19
Pilate [[G4091]] also [[G2532]] had a notice [[G5102]] posted [[G5087]] on [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] cross. [[G4716]] It read: [[G1510]] Jesus [[G2424]] of [[G3588]] Nazareth, [[G3480]] the [[G3588]] King [[G935]] of the [[G3588]] Jews. [[G2453]]

###### 20
Many [[G4183]] of the [[G3588]] Jews [[G2453]] read [[G314]] this [[G3778]] sign, [[G5102]] because [[G3754]] the [[G3588]] place [[G5117]] where [[G3699]] Jesus [[G2424]] was crucified [[G4717]] was [[G1510]] near [[G1451]] the [[G3588]] city, [[G4172]] and [[G2532]] it was [[G1510]] written [[G1125]] in Aramaic, [[G1447]] Latin, [[G4515]] [and] Greek. [[G1676]]

###### 21
So [[G3767]] the [[G3588]] chief priests [[G749]] of the [[G3588]] Jews [[G2453]] said [[G2036]] to Pilate, [[G4091]] “{Do} not [[G3361]] write, [[G1125]] ‘The [[G3588]] King [[G935]] of the [[G3588]] Jews,’ [[G2453]] but only [[G235]] that [[G3754]] He [[G1565]] said, [[G2036]] ‘I am [[G1510]] [the] King [[G935]] of the [[G3588]] Jews.’ [[G2453]]

###### 22
Pilate [[G4091]] answered, [[G611]] “What [[G3739]] I have written, [[G1125]] I have written.” [[G1125]]

###### 23
When [[G3753]] the [[G3588]] soldiers [[G4757]] had crucified [[G4717]] Jesus, [[G2424]] they divided [[G2983]] His [[G846]] garments [[G2440]] [into] four [[G5064]] parts, [[G3313]] [one] [[G3313]] for each [[G1538]] soldier, [[G4757]] [with] [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] tunic [remaining]. [[G5509]] [It] [[G5509]] was [[G1510]] seamless, [[G729]] woven [[G5307]] in one piece [[G3650]] from [[G1537]] top to bottom. [[G509]]

###### 24
So [[G3767]] they said [[G2036]] to [[G4314]] one another, [[G240]] “Let us not tear it. [[G4977]] Instead, [[G235]] let us cast lots [[G2975]] to see [[G4012]] who [[G5101]] [will get] [[G1510]] it.” [[G846]] This was to [[G2443]] fulfill [[G4137]] the [[G3588]] Scripture: [[G1124]] “They divided [[G1266]] My [[G1473]] garments [[G2440]] among them, [[G1438]] and [[G2532]] cast [[G906]] lots [[G2819]] for [[G1909]] My [[G1473]] clothing.” [[G2441]] So [[G3767]] that [is what] [[G3778]] the [[G3588]] soldiers [[G4757]] did. [[G4160]]

###### 25
Near [[G3844]] the [[G3588]] cross [[G4716]] of Jesus [[G2424]] stood [[G2476]] His [[G846]] mother [[G3384]] and [[G2532]] [her] [[G3384]] sister, [[G79]] [as well as] Mary [[G3137]] the [wife] [[G3588]] of Clopas [[G2832]] and [[G2532]] Mary [[G3137]] Magdalene. [[G3094]]

###### 26
[When] [[G3767]] Jesus [[G2424]] saw [[G3708]] [His] [[G3588]] mother [[G3384]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] disciple [[G3101]] whom [[G3739]] He loved [[G25]] standing nearby, [[G3936]] He said [[G3004]] to [[G3588]] [His] mother, [[G3384]] “Woman, [[G1135]] here [is] [[G2400]] your [[G4771]] son.” [[G5207]]

###### 27
Then [[G1534]] He said [[G3004]] to the [[G3588]] disciple, [[G3101]] “Here [is] [[G2400]] your [[G4771]] mother.” [[G3384]] So [[G2532]] from [[G575]] that [[G1565]] hour, [[G5610]] [this] [[G3588]] disciple [[G3101]] took [[G2983]] her [[G846]] into [[G1519]] [his] [[G3588]] [home]. [[G2398]]

###### 28
After [[G3326]] this, [[G3778]] knowing [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] everything [[G3956]] had now been accomplished, [[G5055]] [and] to [[G2443]] fulfill [[G5048]] the [[G3588]] Scripture, [[G1124]] Jesus [[G2424]] said, [[G3004]] “I am thirsty.” [[G1372]]

###### 29
A jar [[G4632]] of [[G3324]] sour wine [[G3690]] was sitting [there]. [[G2749]] So [[G3767]] they soaked [[G3324]] a sponge [[G4699]] [in the] wine, [[G3690]] put [it] on [[G4060]] a stalk of hyssop, [[G5301]] [and] lifted [[G4374]] it [[G846]] to [His] [[G3588]] mouth. [[G4750]]

###### 30
When [[G3753]] Jesus [[G2424]] had received [[G2983]] the [[G3588]] sour wine, [[G3690]] He said, [[G2036]] “It is finished.” [[G5055]] And [[G2532]] bowing [[G2827]] [His] [[G3588]] head, [[G2776]] He yielded up [[G3860]] [His] [[G3588]] spirit. [[G4151]]

###### 31
It was [[G1510]] [the] day of Preparation, [[G3904]] [and] [[G1063]] [the next] [[G1565]] day [[G2250]] was [[G1510]] a High [[G3173]] Sabbath. [[G4521]] In order that [[G2443]] the [[G3588]] bodies [[G4983]] would not remain [[G3306]] on [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] cross [[G4716]] during [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] Sabbath, [[G4521]] the [[G3588]] Jews [[G2453]] asked [[G2065]] Pilate [[G4091]] to have [[G2443]] the [[G3588]] legs [[G4628]] broken [[G2608]] and [[G2532]] [the bodies] [[G846]] removed. [[G142]]

###### 32
So [[G3767]] the [[G3588]] soldiers [[G4757]] came [[G2064]] and [[G2532]] broke [[G2608]] the [[G3588]] legs [[G4628]] of the [[G3588]] first [man] [[G4413]] who [[G3588]] had been crucified with [[G4957]] [Jesus], [[G846]] and [[G2532]] [those] of the [[G3588]] other. [[G243]]

###### 33
But [[G1161]] when [[G5613]] they came [[G2064]] to [[G1909]] Jesus [[G2424]] [and] saw that [[G3708]] He [[G846]] was already [[G2235]] dead, [[G2348]] they did not break [[G2608]] His [[G846]] legs. [[G4628]]

###### 34
Instead, [[G235]] one [[G1520]] of the [[G3588]] soldiers [[G4757]] pierced [[G3572]] His [[G846]] side [[G4125]] with a spear, [[G3057]] and [[G2532]] immediately [[G2112]] blood [[G129]] and [[G2532]] water [[G5204]] flowed out. [[G1831]]

###### 35
The [one who] [[G3588]] saw [it] [[G3708]] has testified to this, [[G3140]] and [[G2532]] his [[G846]] testimony [[G3141]] is [[G1510]] true. [[G228]] He [[G1565]] knows [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] he is telling [[G3004]] [the] truth, [[G227]] so that [[G2443]] you [[G4771]] also [[G2532]] may believe. [[G4100]]

###### 36
Now [[G1063]] these things [[G3778]] happened [[G1096]] so that [[G2443]] the [[G3588]] Scripture [[G1124]] would be fulfilled: [[G4137]] “Not one [[G3756]] of His [[G846]] bones [[G3747]] will be broken.” [[G4937]]

###### 37
And, [[G2532]] as another [[G2087]] Scripture [[G1124]] says: [[G3004]] “They will look [[G3708]] on [[G1519]] the [One] [[G3739]] they have pierced.” [[G1574]]

###### 38
Afterward, [[G1161]] Joseph [[G2501]] of [[G575]] Arimathea, [[G707]] who was [[G1510]] a disciple [[G3101]] of Jesus [[G2424]] (but [[G1161]] secretly [[G2928]] for [[G1223]] fear [[G5401]] of the [[G3588]] Jews), [[G2453]] asked [[G2065]] Pilate [[G4091]] to [[G2443]] let him remove [[G142]] the [[G3588]] body [[G4983]] of Jesus. [[G2424]] Pilate [[G4091]] gave him permission, [[G2010]] so [[G3767]] he came [[G2064]] and [[G2532]] removed [[G142]] His [[G846]] body. [[G4983]]

###### 39
Nicodemus, [[G3530]] who [[G3588]] had previously come [[G2064]] to [[G4314]] [Jesus] [[G846]] at night, [[G3571]] also [[G2532]] brought [[G5342]] a mixture [[G3395]] of myrrh [[G4666]] and [[G2532]] aloes, [[G250]] about [[G5613]] seventy-five pounds. [[G1540]]

###### 40
So [[G3767]] they took [[G2983]] the [[G3588]] body [[G4983]] of Jesus [[G2424]] and [[G2532]] wrapped [[G1210]] it [[G846]] in linen cloths [[G3608]] with [[G3326]] the [[G3588]] spices, [[G759]] according to [[G2531]] [the] Jewish [[G2453]] burial [[G1779]] custom. [[G1485]]

###### 41
Now [[G1161]] there was [[G1510]] a garden [[G2779]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] place [[G5117]] where [[G3699]] [Jesus] was crucified, [[G4717]] and [[G2532]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] garden [[G2779]] a new [[G2537]] tomb [[G3419]] in [[G1722]] which [[G3739]] no one [[G3762]] had yet been [[G1510]] laid. [[G5087]]

###### 42
And [[G3767]] because it was [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] Jewish [[G2453]] day of Preparation [[G3904]] [and] [[G3754]] the [[G3588]] tomb [[G3419]] was [[G1510]] nearby, [[G1451]] they laid [[G5087]] Jesus [[G2424]] there. [[G1563]]
