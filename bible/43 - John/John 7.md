### 1
After [[G3326]] this, [[G3778]] Jesus [[G2424]] traveled [[G4043]] throughout [[G1722]] Galilee. [[G1056]] He did not want [[G2309]] to travel [[G4043]] in [[G1722]] Judea, [[G2449]] because [[G3754]] the [[G3588]] Jews [there] [[G2453]] were trying [[G2212]] to kill [[G615]] Him. [[G846]]

### 2
However, [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] Jewish [[G2453]] Feast [[G1859]] of [[G3588]] Tabernacles [[G4634]] was [[G1510]] near. [[G1451]]

### 3
So [[G3767]] [Jesus’] [[G846]] brothers [[G80]] said [[G2036]] to [[G4314]] Him, [[G846]] “Leave [[G3327]] here [[G1782]] and [[G2532]] go [[G5217]] to [[G1519]] Judea, [[G2449]] so that [[G2443]] Your [[G4771]] disciples [[G3101]] [there] [[G2532]] may see [[G2334]] [the] [[G4771]] works [[G2041]] You are doing. [[G4160]]

### 4
For [[G1063]] no one [[G3762]] [who] [[G846]] wants [[G2212]] to be [known] [[G1510]] publicly [[G3954]] acts [[G4160]] in [[G1722]] secret. [[G2927]] Since [[G1487]] You are doing [[G4160]] these things, [[G3778]] show [[G5319]] Yourself [[G4572]] to the [[G3588]] world.” [[G2889]]

### 5
For [[G1063]] [even] [[G3761]] His [[G846]] [own] [[G3588]] brothers [[G80]] did {not} believe [[G4100]] in [[G1519]] Him. [[G846]]

### 6
Therefore [[G3767]] Jesus [[G2424]] told [[G3004]] them, [[G846]] “Although [[G1161]] your [[G5212]] time [[G2540]] is [[G1510]] always [[G3842]] at hand, [[G2092]] My [[G1699]] time [[G2540]] {has} not yet [[G3768]] come. [[G3918]]

### 7
The [[G3588]] world [[G2889]] cannot [[G1410]] hate [[G3404]] you, [[G4771]] but [[G1161]] it hates [[G3404]] Me, [[G1473]] because [[G3754]] I [[G1473]] testify [[G3140]] that [[G3754]] its [[G846]] works [[G2041]] are [[G1510]] evil. [[G4190]]

### 8
Go up [[G305]] to [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] feast [[G1859]] on your own. [[G4771]] I [[G1473]] {am} not [[G3756]] going up [[G305]] to [[G1519]] this [[G3778]] feast, [[G1859]] because [[G3754]] My [[G1699]] time [[G2540]] {has} not yet [[G3768]] come.” [[G4137]]

### 9
Having said [[G2036]] [this], [[G3778]] [Jesus] remained [[G3306]] in [[G1722]] Galilee. [[G1056]]

### 10
But [[G1161]] [after] [[G5613]] His [[G846]] brothers [[G80]] had gone up [[G305]] to [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] feast, [[G1859]] He [[G846]] also [[G2532]] went— [[G305]] not [[G3756]] publicly, [[G5320]] but [[G235]] in [[G1722]] secret. [[G2927]]

### 11
So [[G3767]] the [[G3588]] Jews [[G2453]] were looking for [[G2212]] Him [[G846]] at [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] feast [[G1859]] and [[G2532]] asking, [[G2036]] “Where [[G4226]] is [[G1510]] He?” [[G1565]]

### 12
Many [[G4183]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] crowds [[G3793]] were [[G1510]] whispering [[G1112]] about [[G4012]] Him. [[G846]] Some [[G3588]] said, [[G2036]] “He is [[G1510]] a good [man].” [[G18]] But [[G1161]] others [[G243]] replied, [[G2036]] “No, [[G3756]] He deceives [[G4105]] the [[G3588]] people.” [[G3793]]

### 13
Yet [[G3305]] no one [[G3762]] would speak [[G2980]] publicly [[G3954]] about [[G4012]] Him [[G846]] for [[G1223]] fear [[G5401]] of the [[G3588]] Jews. [[G2453]]

### 14
About halfway through [[G3322]] the [[G3588]] feast, [[G1859]] Jesus [[G2424]] went up [[G305]] to [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] temple courts [[G2411]] and [[G2532]] began to teach. [[G1321]]

### 15
The [[G3588]] Jews [[G2453]] were amazed [[G2296]] [and] asked, [[G3004]] “How [[G4459]] {did} this [man] [[G3778]] attain [[G1492]] [such] learning [[G1121]] without [[G3361]] having studied?” [[G3129]]

### 16
“My [[G1699]] teaching [[G1322]] is [[G1510]] not [[G3756]] My own,” [[G1699]] Jesus [[G2424]] replied. [[G611]] “[It comes] [[G235]] from Him who [[G3588]] sent [[G3992]] Me. [[G1473]]

### 17
If [[G1437]] anyone [[G5100]] desires [[G2309]] to do [[G4160]] His [[G846]] will, [[G2307]] he will know [[G1097]] whether [[G4220]] [My] [[G3588]] teaching [[G1322]] is [[G1510]] from [[G1537]] God [[G2316]] or [whether] [[G2228]] I [[G1473]] speak [[G2980]] on [[G575]] My own. [[G1683]]

### 18
He who [[G3588]] speaks [[G2980]] on [[G575]] his own [authority] [[G1438]] seeks [[G2212]] [his] [[G3588]] own [[G2398]] glory, [[G1391]] but [[G1161]] He who [[G3588]] seeks [[G2212]] the [[G3588]] glory [[G1391]] of the [One who] [[G3588]] sent [[G3992]] Him [[G846]] is [[G1510]] a man of truth; [[G227]] in [[G1722]] Him [[G846]] there is [[G1510]] no [[G3756]] falsehood. [[G93]]

### 19
{Has} not [[G3756]] Moses [[G3475]] given [[G1325]] you [[G4771]] the [[G3588]] Law? [[G3551]] Yet [[G2532]] not one [[G3762]] of [[G1537]] you [[G4771]] keeps [[G4160]] [it]. [[G3551]] Why [[G5101]] are you trying [[G2212]] to kill [[G615]] Me?” [[G1473]]

### 20
“You have [[G2192]] a demon,” [[G1140]] the [[G3588]] crowd [[G3793]] replied. [[G611]] “Who [[G5101]] is trying [[G2212]] to kill [[G615]] You?” [[G4771]]

### 21
Jesus [[G2424]] answered [[G611]] them, [[G846]] “I did [[G4160]] one [[G1520]] miracle, [[G2041]] and [[G2532]] you are all astonished. [[G2296]]

### 22
[But] because [[G1223]] Moses [[G3475]] gave [[G1325]] you [[G4771]] circumcision, [[G4061]] you circumcise [[G4059]] a boy [[G444]] on [[G1722]] [the] Sabbath [[G4521]] (not [[G3756]] that [[G3754]] it is [[G1510]] from [[G1537]] Moses, [[G3475]] but [[G235]] from [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] patriarchs.) [[G3962]]

### 23
If [[G1487]] a boy [[G444]] can be circumcised [[G4061]] on [[G1722]] [the] Sabbath [[G4521]] so that [[G2443]] the [[G3588]] Law [[G3551]] of Moses [[G3475]] {will} not [[G3361]] be broken, [[G3089]] [why] are you angry [[G5520]] with Me [[G1473]] for [[G3754]] making [[G4160]] [the] whole [[G3650]] man [[G444]] well [[G5199]] on [[G1722]] the Sabbath? [[G4521]]

### 24
Stop [[G3361]] judging [[G2919]] by [[G2596]] outward appearances, [[G3799]] [and start] [[G235]] judging [[G2919]] justly.” [[G1342]]

### 25
Then [[G3767]] some [[G5100]] of [[G1537]] the [people] [[G3588]] of Jerusalem [[G2415]] began to say, [[G2036]] “Isn’t [[G1510]] this [[G3778]] [the man] [[G3739]] they are trying [[G2212]] to kill? [[G615]]

### 26
Yet [[G2532]] here [[G2400]] He is, speaking [[G2980]] publicly, [[G3954]] and [[G2532]] they are not saying [[G3004]] [anything] [[G3762]] to Him. [[G846]] {Have} the [[G3588]] rulers [[G758]] truly [[G230]] recognized [[G1097]] that [[G3754]] this [[G3778]] is [[G1510]] the [[G3588]] Christ? [[G5547]]

### 27
But [[G235]] we know [[G1492]] where [[G4159]] this [man] [[G3778]] is {from}. [[G1510]] When [[G3752]] the [[G3588]] Christ [[G5547]] comes, [[G2064]] no one [[G3762]] will know [[G1097]] where [[G4159]] He is {from}.” [[G1510]]

### 28
Then [[G3767]] Jesus, [[G2424]] still teaching [[G1321]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] temple courts, [[G2411]] cried out, [[G2896]] “You know [[G1492]] Me, [[G2504]] and [[G2532]] you know [[G1492]] where [[G4159]] I am {from}. [[G1510]] I have not come [[G2064]] on [[G575]] My own accord, [[G1683]] but [[G235]] He who [[G3588]] sent [[G3992]] Me [[G1473]] is [[G1510]] true. [[G228]] You [[G4771]] {do} not [[G3756]] know [[G1492]] Him, [[G3739]]

### 29
but I [[G1473]] know [[G1492]] Him, [[G846]] because [[G3754]] I am [[G1510]] from [[G3844]] Him [[G846]] and He [[G2548]] sent [[G649]] Me.” [[G1473]]

### 30
So [[G3767]] they tried [[G2212]] to seize [[G4084]] Him, [[G846]] but [[G2532]] no one [[G3762]] laid [[G1911]] a hand [[G5495]] on [[G1909]] Him, [[G846]] because [[G3754]] His [[G846]] hour [[G5610]] {had} not yet [[G3768]] come. [[G2064]]

### 31
Many [[G4183]] in [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] crowd, [[G3793]] however, [[G1161]] believed [[G4100]] in [[G1519]] Him [[G846]] and [[G2532]] said, [[G2036]] “When [[G3752]] the [[G3588]] Christ [[G5547]] comes, [[G2064]] will He perform [[G4160]] more [[G4119]] signs [[G4592]] than [[G3739]] this [man]?” [[G3778]]

### 32
[When] the [[G3588]] Pharisees [[G5330]] heard [[G191]] the [[G3588]] crowd [[G3793]] whispering [[G1111]] these things [[G3778]] about [[G4012]] [Jesus], [[G846]] [they] [[G5330]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] chief priests [[G749]] sent [[G649]] officers [[G5257]] to [[G2443]] arrest [[G4084]] Him. [[G846]]

### 33
So [[G3767]] Jesus [[G2424]] said, [[G2036]] “I am [[G1510]] with [[G3326]] you [[G4771]] only [[G2089]] a little while [[G3398]] longer, [[G5550]] and then [[G2532]] I am going [[G5217]] to [[G4314]] the [One who] [[G3588]] sent [[G3992]] Me. [[G1473]]

### 34
You will look for [[G2212]] Me, [[G1473]] [but] [[G2532]] you will not find [[G2147]] Me; [[G1473]] and [[G2532]] where [[G3699]] I [[G1473]] am, [[G1510]] you [[G4771]] cannot [[G1410]] come.” [[G2064]]

### 35
At this, [[G3767]] the [[G3588]] Jews [[G2453]] said [[G2036]] to [[G4314]] one another, [[G1438]] “Where [[G4226]] {does} He [[G3778]] intend [[G3195]] to go [[G4198]] that [[G3754]] we [[G1473]] will not find [[G2147]] Him [[G846]] vvv? [[G3361]] Will He [[G3195]] go [[G4198]] where [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] Jews are dispersed [[G1290]] among the [[G3588]] Greeks, [[G1672]] and [[G2532]] teach [[G1321]] the [[G3588]] Greeks? [[G1672]]

### 36
What [[G5101]] does He mean [[G3056]] by [[G3739]] saying, [[G2036]] ‘You will look for [[G2212]] Me, [[G1473]] [but] [[G2532]] you will not find [[G2147]] Me,’ [[G1473]] and, [[G2532]] ‘Where [[G3699]] I [[G1473]] am, [[G1510]] you [[G4771]] cannot [[G1410]] come’?” [[G2064]]

### 37
On [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] last [[G2078]] [and] [[G3588]] greatest [[G3173]] day [[G2250]] of the [[G3588]] feast, [[G1859]] Jesus [[G2424]] stood up [[G2476]] and [[G2532]] called out in a loud voice, [[G2896]] “If [[G1437]] anyone [[G5100]] is thirsty, [[G1372]] let him come [[G2064]] to [[G4314]] Me [[G1473]] and [[G2532]] drink. [[G4095]]

### 38
Whoever [[G3588]] believes [[G4100]] in [[G1519]] Me, [[G1473]] as [[G2531]] the [[G3588]] Scripture [[G1124]] has said: [[G2036]] ‘Streams [[G4215]] of living [[G2198]] water [[G5204]] will flow [[G4482]] from [[G1537]] [within] [[G2836]] him.’” [[G846]]

### 39
He was speaking [[G2036]] about [[G4012]] the [[G3588]] Spirit, [[G4151]] whom [[G3739]] those who [[G3588]] believed [[G4100]] in [[G1519]] Him [[G846]] were later [[G3195]] to receive. [[G2983]] For [[G1063]] [the] Spirit [[G4151]] had [[G1510]] not yet [been given], [[G3768]] because [[G3754]] Jesus [[G2424]] {had} not yet [[G3764]] been glorified. [[G1392]]

### 40
On hearing [[G191]] these [[G3778]] words, [[G3056]] [some] of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] people [[G3793]] said,, [[G2036]] “This [[G3778]] is [[G1510]] truly [[G230]] the [[G3588]] Prophet.” [[G4396]]

### 41
Others [[G243]] declared, [[G2036]] “This [[G3778]] is [[G1510]] the [[G3588]] Christ.” [[G5547]] But [[G1161]] still others [[G3588]] asked, [[G2036]] “[How can] [[G1063]] the [[G3588]] Christ [[G5547]] come [[G2064]] from [[G1537]] Galilee? [[G1056]]

### 42
Doesn’t [[G3756]] the [[G3588]] Scripture [[G1124]] say [[G2036]] that [[G3754]] the [[G3588]] Christ [[G5547]] will come [[G2064]] from [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] line [[G4690]] of David [[G1138]] and [[G2532]] from [[G575]] Bethlehem, [[G965]] the [[G3588]] village [[G2968]] where [[G3699]] David [[G1138]] lived?” [[G1510]]

### 43
So [[G3767]] there was [[G1096]] division [[G4978]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] crowd [[G3793]] because of [[G1223]] [Jesus]. [[G846]]

### 44
Some [[G5100]] of [[G1537]] them [[G846]] wanted [[G2309]] to seize [[G4084]] Him, [[G846]] but [[G235]] no one [[G3762]] laid [[G1911]] a hand [[G5495]] on [[G1909]] Him. [[G846]]

### 45
Then [[G3767]] the [[G3588]] officers [[G5257]] returned [[G2064]] to [[G4314]] the [[G3588]] chief priests [[G749]] and [[G2532]] Pharisees, [[G5330]] [who] [[G1565]] asked [[G2036]] them, [[G846]] “Why [[G1223]] didn’t you bring [[G71]] Him {in}?” [[G846]]

### 46
“Never {has} [[G3763]] anyone [[G444]] spoken [[G2980]] like [[G5613]] this [[G3778]] man!” [[G444]] the [[G3588]] officers [[G5257]] answered. [[G611]]

### 47
“{Have} you [[G4771]] also [[G2532]] been deceived?” [[G4105]] replied [[G611]] the [[G3588]] Pharisees. [[G5330]]

### 48
“{Have} [[G3361]] any [[G5100]] of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] rulers [[G758]] or [[G2228]] Pharisees [[G5330]] believed [[G4100]] in [[G1519]] Him? [[G846]]

### 49
But [[G235]] this [[G3778]] crowd [[G3793]] that [[G3588]] does not know [[G1097]] the [[G3588]] Law, [[G3551]] they are [[G1510]] under a curse.” [[G1944]]

### 50
Nicodemus, [[G3530]] who [[G3588]] had gone [[G2064]] to [[G4314]] [Jesus] [[G846]] earlier, [[G4386]] [and who himself] was [[G1510]] one [[G1520]] of [[G1537]] them, [[G846]] asked, [[G3004]]

### 51
“{Does} our [[G1473]] law [[G3551]] convict [[G2919]] a man [[G444]] without [[G3361]] first [[G4412]] hearing [[G191]] from [[G3844]] him [[G846]] to determine [[G1097]] what [[G5101]] he has done?” [[G4160]]

### 52
“Aren’t [[G1510]] you [[G4771]] also [[G2532]] from [[G1537]] Galilee?” [[G1056]] they replied. [[G611]] “Look into it, [[G2045]] and [[G2532]] you will see [[G2400]] that [[G3754]] no [[G3756]] prophet [[G4396]] comes [[G1453]] out of [[G1537]] Galilee.” [[G1056]]

### 53
Then [[G2532]] each [[G1538]] went [[G4198]] to [[G1519]] his own [[G846]] home. [[G3624]]
