###### 1
I [[G1473]] am [[G1510]] the [[G3588]] TRUE [[G228]] vine, [[G288]] and [[G2532]] My [[G1473]] Father [[G3962]] is [[G1510]] the [[G3588]] keeper of the vineyard. [[G1092]]

###### 2
He cuts off [[G142]] every [[G3956]] branch [[G2814]] in [[G1722]] Me [[G1473]] that bears no [[G5342]] fruit, [[G2590]] and [[G2532]] every [branch] [[G3956]] that [[G3588]] does bear [[G5342]] fruit, [[G2590]] He prunes [[G2508]] to make it [[G2443]] even more fruitful. [[G5342]]

###### 3
You [[G4771]] are [[G1510]] already [[G2235]] clean [[G2513]] because of [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] word [[G3056]] I have spoken [[G2980]] to you. [[G4771]]

###### 4
Remain [[G3306]] in [[G1722]] Me, [[G1473]] and I {will remain} [[G2504]] in [[G1722]] you. [[G4771]] Just as [[G2531]] no [[G3756]] branch [[G2814]] can [[G1410]] bear [[G5342]] fruit [[G2590]] by itself [[G1438]] unless [[G1437]] it remains [[G3306]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] vine, [[G288]] neither [can] [[G3761]] you [bear fruit] [[G4771]] unless [[G1437]] you remain [[G3306]] in [[G1722]] Me. [[G1473]]

###### 5
I [[G1473]] am [[G1510]] the [[G3588]] vine [[G288]] [and] you [are] [[G4771]] the [[G3588]] branches. [[G2814]] The [one who] [[G3588]] remains [[G3306]] in [[G1722]] Me, [[G1473]] and I [[G2504]] in [[G1722]] him, [[G846]] will bear [[G5342]] much [[G4183]] fruit. [[G2590]] For [[G3754]] apart from [[G5565]] Me [[G1473]] you can [[G1410]] do [[G4160]] nothing. [[G3762]]

###### 6
If [[G1437]] anyone [[G5100]] {does} not [[G3361]] remain [[G3306]] in [[G1722]] Me, [[G1473]] {he is} like [[G5613]] a [[G3588]] branch [[G2814]] that is thrown [[G906]] away [[G1854]] and [[G2532]] withers. [[G3583]] [Such branches] [[G846]] are gathered up, [[G4863]] thrown [[G906]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] fire, [[G4442]] and [[G2532]] burned. [[G2545]]

###### 7
If [[G1437]] you remain [[G3306]] in [[G1722]] Me [[G1473]] and [[G2532]] My [[G1473]] words [[G4487]] remain [[G3306]] in [[G1722]] you, [[G4771]] ask [[G154]] whatever [[G3739]] you wish, [[G2309]] and [[G2532]] it will be done [[G1096]] for you. [[G4771]]

###### 8
This [is to] [[G3778]] My [[G1473]] Father’s [[G3962]] glory, [[G1392]] that [[G2443]] you bear [[G5342]] much [[G4183]] fruit, [[G2590]] [proving] yourselves to be [[G1096]] My [[G1699]] disciples. [[G3101]]

###### 9
As [[G2531]] the [[G3588]] Father [[G3962]] has loved [[G25]] Me, [[G1473]] so [[G2504]] have I loved [[G25]] you. [[G4771]] Remain [[G3306]] in [[G1722]] My [[G1699]] love. [[G26]]

###### 10
If [[G1437]] you keep [[G5083]] My [[G1473]] commandments, [[G1785]] you will remain [[G3306]] in [[G1722]] My [[G1473]] love, [[G26]] just as [[G2531]] I [[G1473]] have kept [[G5083]] My [[G1473]] Father’s [[G3962]] commandments [[G1785]] and [[G2532]] remain [[G3306]] in [[G1722]] His [[G846]] love. [[G26]]

###### 11
I have told [[G2980]] you [[G4771]] these things [[G3778]] so that [[G2443]] My [[G1699]] joy [[G5479]] may be [[G1510]] in [[G1722]] you [[G4771]] and [[G2532]] your [[G4771]] joy [[G5479]] may be complete. [[G4137]]

###### 12
This [[G3778]] is [[G1510]] My [[G1699]] commandment, [[G1785]] that [[G2443]] you love [[G25]] one another [[G240]] as [[G2531]] I have loved [[G25]] you. [[G4771]]

###### 13
Greater [[G3173]] love [[G26]] has [[G2192]] no one [[G3762]] than this, [[G3778]] that [[G2443]] [he] [[G5100]] lay down [[G5087]] his [[G846]] life [[G5590]] for [[G5228]] his [[G846]] friends. [[G5384]]

###### 14
You [[G4771]] are [[G1510]] My [[G1473]] friends [[G5384]] if [[G1437]] you do [[G4160]] what [[G3739]] I [[G1473]] command [[G1781]] you. [[G4771]]

###### 15
No longer [[G3765]] do I call [[G3004]] you [[G4771]] servants, [[G1401]] for [[G3754]] a servant [[G1401]] {does} not [[G3756]] understand [[G1492]] what [[G5101]] his [[G846]] master [[G2962]] is doing. [[G4160]] But [[G1161]] I have called [[G2046]] you [[G4771]] friends, [[G5384]] because [[G3754]] everything [[G3956]] I have learned [[G191]] from [[G3844]] My [[G1473]] Father [[G3962]] I have made known [[G1107]] to you. [[G4771]]

###### 16
You [[G4771]] {did} not [[G3756]] choose [[G1586]] Me, [[G1473]] but [[G235]] I [[G1473]] chose [[G1586]] you. [[G4771]] And [[G2532]] I appointed [[G5087]] you [[G4771]] to [[G2443]] go [[G5217]] and [[G2532]] bear [[G5342]] fruit— [[G2590]] fruit [[G2590]] that will remain— [[G3306]] so that [[G2443]] whatever [[G3754]] you ask [[G154]] the [[G3588]] Father [[G3962]] in [[G1722]] My [[G1473]] name, [[G3686]] He will give [[G1325]] you. [[G4771]]

###### 17
This [[G3778]] is My command [[G1781]] to you: [[G4771]] Love [[G25]] one another. [[G240]]

###### 18
If [[G1487]] the [[G3588]] world [[G2889]] hates [[G3404]] you, [[G4771]] understand [[G1097]] that [[G3754]] it hated [[G3404]] Me [[G1473]] [first]. [[G4412]]

###### 19
If [[G1487]] you were [[G1510]] of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] world, [[G2889]] [it] [[G2889]] would love [you] [[G5368]] [as] its [[G3588]] own. [[G2398]] Instead, [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] world [[G2889]] hates [[G3404]] you, [[G4771]] because [[G3754]] you are [[G1510]] not [[G3756]] of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] world, [[G2889]] but [[G235]] I [[G1473]] have chosen [[G1586]] you [[G4771]] out of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] world. [[G2889]]

###### 20
Remember [[G3421]] the [[G3588]] word [[G3056]] that [[G3739]] I [[G1473]] spoke [[G2036]] to you: [[G4771]] ‘No [[G3756]] servant [[G1401]] is [[G1510]] greater than [[G3173]] his [[G846]] master.’ [[G2962]] If [[G1487]] they persecuted [[G1377]] Me, [[G1473]] they will persecute [[G1377]] you [[G4771]] as well; [[G2532]] if [[G1487]] they kept [[G5083]] My [[G1473]] word, [[G3056]] they will keep [[G5083]] yours [[G5212]] as well. [[G2532]]

###### 21
But [[G235]] they will treat [[G4160]] you [[G4771]] like this [[G3778]] on account of [[G1223]] My [[G1473]] name, [[G3686]] because [[G3754]] they do not know [[G1492]] the [One who] [[G3588]] sent [[G3992]] Me. [[G1473]]

###### 22
If [[G1487]] I had not come [[G2064]] and [[G2532]] spoken [[G2980]] to them, [[G846]] they would not be guilty of sin. [[G2192]] Now, [[G3568]] however, [[G1161]] they have [[G2192]] no [[G3756]] excuse [[G4392]] for [[G4012]] their [[G846]] sin. [[G266]]

###### 23
Whoever [[G3588]] hates [[G3404]] Me [[G1473]] hates [[G3404]] My [[G1473]] Father [[G3962]] as well. [[G2532]]

###### 24
If [[G1487]] I had not done [[G4160]] among [[G1722]] them [[G846]] the [[G3588]] works [[G2041]] that [[G3739]] no one [[G3762]] else [[G243]] did, [[G4160]] they would not be guilty of sin; [[G2192]] but [[G1161]] now [[G3568]] they have seen [[G3708]] and [[G2532]] hated [[G3404]] both [[G2532]] Me [[G1473]] and [[G2532]] My [[G1473]] Father. [[G3962]]

###### 25
But [this is] [[G235]] to [[G2443]] fulfill [[G4137]] [what] [[G3056]] is written [[G1125]] in [[G1722]] their [[G846]] Law: [[G3551]] ‘They hated [[G3404]] Me [[G1473]] without reason.’ [[G1432]]

###### 26
When [[G3752]] the [[G3588]] Advocate [[G3875]] comes, [[G2064]] whom [[G3739]] I [[G1473]] will send [[G3992]] to you [[G4771]] from [[G3844]] the [[G3588]] Father— [[G3962]] the [[G3588]] Spirit [[G4151]] of truth [[G225]] who [[G3739]] goes out [[G1607]] from [[G3844]] the [[G3588]] Father— [[G3962]] He [[G1565]] will testify [[G3140]] about [[G4012]] Me. [[G1473]]

###### 27
And [[G1161]] you [[G4771]] also [[G2532]] must testify, [[G3140]] because [[G3754]] you have been [[G1510]] with [[G3326]] Me [[G1473]] from [[G575]] [the] beginning. [[G746]]
