### 1
Six [[G1803]] days [[G2250]] before [[G4253]] the [[G3588]] Passover, [[G3957]] Jesus [[G2424]] came [[G2064]] to [[G1519]] Bethany, [[G963]] [the hometown of] [[G3699]] Lazarus, [[G2976]] whom [[G3739]] [He] [[G2424]] had raised [[G1453]] from [[G1537]] [the] dead. [[G3498]]

### 2
So [[G3767]] they hosted [[G4160]] a dinner [[G1173]] for [Jesus] [[G846]] there. [[G1563]] Martha [[G3136]] served, [[G1247]] and [[G1161]] Lazarus [[G2976]] was [[G1510]] among [[G1520]] those [[G3588]] reclining at the table [[G345]] with [[G4862]] Him. [[G846]]

### 3
Then [[G3767]] Mary [[G3137]] took [[G2983]] about a pint [[G3046]] of expensive [[G4186]] perfume, [[G3464]] made of pure [[G4101]] nard, [[G3487]] [and] she anointed [[G218]] Jesus’ [[G2424]] feet [[G4228]] and [[G2532]] wiped [[G1591]] [them] [[G4228]] with [[G3588]] her [[G846]] hair. [[G2359]] And [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] house [[G3614]] was filled [[G4137]] with [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] fragrance [[G3744]] of the [[G3588]] perfume. [[G3464]]

### 4
But [[G1161]] one [[G1520]] of [[G1537]] His [[G846]] disciples, [[G3101]] Judas [[G2455]] Iscariot, [[G2469]] who [[G3588]] was going [[G3195]] to betray [[G3860]] Him, [[G846]] asked, [[G3004]]

### 5
“Why [[G1223]] wasn’t [[G3756]] this [[G3778]] perfume [[G3464]] sold [[G4097]] for three hundred [[G5145]] denarii [[G1220]] and [the money] [[G2532]] given [[G1325]] to [the] poor?” [[G4434]]

### 6
[Judas] did not say [[G2036]] this [[G3778]] because [[G3754]] he [[G846]] cared [[G3199]] about [[G4012]] the [[G3588]] poor, [[G4434]] but [[G235]] because [[G3754]] he was [[G1510]] a thief. [[G2812]] As keeper [[G2192]] of the [[G3588]] money bag, [[G1101]] he used to take [[G941]] from what [[G3588]] was put into [it]. [[G906]]

### 7
“Leave her alone,” [[G863]] Jesus [[G2424]] replied. [[G2036]] “She was intended [[G2443]] to keep [[G5083]] [this perfume] [[G846]] to prepare for [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] day [[G2250]] of [[G3588]] My [[G1473]] burial. [[G1780]]

### 8
The [[G3588]] poor [[G4434]] you will always have [[G2192]] with [[G3326]] you, [[G1438]] but [[G1161]] {you will} not [[G3756]] always [[G3842]] have [[G2192]] Me.” [[G1473]]

### 9
Meanwhile [[G3767]] a large [[G4183]] crowd [[G3793]] of [[G1537]] Jews [[G2453]] learned [[G1097]] that [[G3754]] [Jesus] was [[G1510]] there. [[G1563]] And [[G2532]] they came [[G2064]] not [[G3756]] only [[G3440]] because of [[G1223]] [Him], [[G2424]] but [[G235]] also [[G2532]] to [[G2443]] see [[G3708]] Lazarus, [[G2976]] whom [[G3739]] He had raised [[G1453]] from [[G1537]] [the] dead. [[G3498]]

### 10
[So] [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] chief priests [[G749]] made plans [[G1011]] to [[G2443]] kill [[G615]] Lazarus [[G2976]] as well, [[G2532]]

### 11
for [[G3754]] on account of [[G1223]] him [[G846]] many [[G4183]] of the [[G3588]] Jews [[G2453]] were deserting [them] [[G5217]] and [[G2532]] believing [[G4100]] in [[G1519]] Jesus. [[G2424]]

### 12
The [[G3588]] next day [[G1887]] the [[G3588]] great [[G4183]] crowd [[G3793]] that [[G3588]] had come [[G2064]] to [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] feast [[G1859]] heard [[G191]] that [[G3754]] Jesus [[G2424]] was coming [[G2064]] to [[G1519]] Jerusalem. [[G2414]]

### 13
They took [[G2983]] palm [[G5404]] branches [[G902]] and [[G2532]] went out [[G1831]] to [[G1519]] meet [[G5222]] Him, [[G846]] shouting: [[G2905]] “Hosanna!” [[G5614]] “Blessed is [[G2127]] He who [[G3588]] comes [[G2064]] in [[G1722]] [the] name [[G3686]] of [the] Lord!” [[G2962]] “[ Blessed is ] [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] King [[G935]] of Israel!” [[G2474]]

### 14
Finding [[G2147]] a young donkey, [[G3678]] Jesus [[G2424]] sat [[G2523]] on [[G1909]] it, [[G846]] as [[G2531]] it is [[G1510]] written: [[G1125]]

### 15
“Do not be afraid, [[G5399]] O daughter [[G2364]] of Zion. [[G4622]] See, [[G2400]] your [[G4771]] King [[G935]] is coming, [[G2064]] seated [[G2521]] on [[G1909]] the colt [[G4454]] of a donkey.” [[G3688]]

### 16
At first [[G4413]] His [[G846]] disciples [[G3101]] {did} not [[G3756]] understand [[G1097]] these things, [[G3778]] but [[G235]] after [[G3753]] Jesus [[G2424]] was glorified [[G1392]] they remembered [[G3403]] what had been done [[G4160]] to Him, [[G846]] [ and they realized] that [[G3754]] these very things [[G3778]] had [[G1510]] also [[G2532]] {been} written [[G1125]] about [[G1909]] Him. [[G846]]

### 17
Meanwhile, [[G3767]] many people [[G3793]] continued to testify [[G3140]] that [[G3588]] they had been [[G1510]] with [[G3326]] [Jesus] [[G846]] when [[G3753]] He called [[G5455]] Lazarus [[G2976]] from [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] tomb [[G3419]] and [[G2532]] raised [[G1453]] him [[G846]] from [[G1537]] [the] dead. [[G3498]]

### 18
That is also why [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] crowd [[G3793]] went out to meet [[G5221]] Him, [[G846]] because [[G3754]] they heard that [[G191]] He [[G846]] had performed [[G4160]] this [[G3778]] sign. [[G4592]]

### 19
Then [[G3767]] the [[G3588]] Pharisees [[G5330]] said [[G2036]] to [[G4314]] one another, [[G1438]] “You can see [[G2334]] that [[G3754]] this is doing you no good. [[G5623]] Look [how] [[G2400]] the [[G3588]] whole world [[G2889]] has gone [[G565]] after [[G3694]] Him!” [[G846]]

### 20
Now [[G1161]] there were [[G1510]] some [[G5100]] Greeks [[G1672]] among [[G1537]] those who [[G3588]] went up [[G305]] to [[G2443]] worship [[G4352]] at [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] feast. [[G1859]]

### 21
They [[G3778]] came [[G4334]] to Philip, [[G5376]] who was [[G3588]] from [[G575]] Bethsaida [[G966]] in Galilee, [[G1056]] and [[G2532]] requested [[G2065]] of him, [[G846]] “Sir, [[G2962]] we want [[G2309]] to see [[G3708]] Jesus.” [[G2424]]

### 22
Philip [[G5376]] relayed [this appeal] [[G3004]] to Andrew, [[G406]] [and both of them] [[G406]] went [[G2064]] and [[G2532]] told [[G3004]] Jesus. [[G2424]]

### 23
But [[G1161]] Jesus [[G2424]] replied, [[G611]] “The [[G3588]] hour [[G5610]] has come [[G2064]] for [[G2443]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of Man [[G444]] to be glorified. [[G1392]]

### 24
Truly, [[G281]] truly, [[G281]] I tell [[G3004]] you, [[G4771]] unless [[G1437]] a kernel [[G2848]] of wheat [[G4621]] falls [[G4098]] to [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] ground [[G1093]] [and] dies, [[G599]] it [[G846]] remains [[G3306]] only [a seed]; [[G3441]] but [[G1161]] if [[G1437]] it dies, [[G599]] it bears [[G5342]] much [[G4183]] fruit. [[G2590]]

### 25
Whoever [[G3588]] loves [[G5368]] his [[G846]] life [[G5590]] will lose [[G622]] it, [[G846]] [but] [[G2532]] whoever [[G3588]] hates [[G3404]] his [[G846]] life [[G5590]] in [[G1722]] this [[G3778]] world [[G2889]] will keep [[G5442]] it [[G846]] for [[G1519]] eternal [[G166]] life. [[G2222]]

### 26
If [[G1437]] anyone [[G5100]] serves [[G1247]] Me, [[G1473]] he must follow [[G190]] Me; [[G1473]] and [[G2532]] where [[G3699]] I [[G1473]] am, [[G1510]] My [[G1699]] servant [[G1249]] will be [[G1510]] as well. [[G2532]] If [[G1437]] anyone [[G5100]] serves [[G1247]] Me, [[G1473]] the [[G3588]] Father [[G3962]] will honor [[G5091]] him. [[G846]]

### 27
Now [[G3568]] My [[G1473]] soul [[G5590]] is troubled, [[G5015]] and [[G2532]] what [[G5101]] shall I say? [[G2036]] ‘Father, [[G3962]] save [[G4982]] Me [[G1473]] from [[G1537]] this [[G3778]] hour’? [[G5610]] No, [[G235]] it is for this purpose [[G1223]] that I have come [[G2064]] to [[G1519]] this [[G3778]] hour. [[G5610]]

### 28
Father, [[G3962]] glorify [[G1392]] Your [[G4771]] name!” [[G3686]] Then [[G3767]] a voice [[G5456]] came [[G2064]] from [[G1537]] heaven: [[G3772]] “I have glorified [it], [[G1392]] and [[G2532]] I will glorify [it] [[G1392]] again.” [[G3825]]

### 29
The [[G3588]] crowd [[G3793]] standing [there] [[G2476]] heard [it] [[G191]] [and] said that [[G2036]] it had [[G1096]] thundered. [[G1027]] Others [[G243]] said that [[G2036]] an angel [[G32]] had spoken [[G2980]] to Him. [[G846]]

### 30
In response, [[G611]] Jesus [[G2424]] said, [[G2036]] “This [[G3778]] voice [[G5456]] was [[G1096]] not [[G3756]] for My benefit, [[G1223]] but [[G235]] yours. [[G4771]]

### 31
Now [[G3568]] judgment [[G2920]] is [[G1510]] upon this [[G3778]] world; [[G2889]] now [[G3568]] the [[G3588]] prince [[G758]] of this [[G3778]] world [[G2889]] will be cast [[G1544]] out. [[G1854]]

### 32
And I, [[G2504]] when [[G1437]] I am lifted up [[G5312]] from [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] earth, [[G1093]] will draw [[G1670]] all [men] [[G3956]] to [[G4314]] Myself.” [[G1683]]

### 33
He said [[G2036]] this [[G3778]] to indicate [[G4591]] the kind of [[G4169]] death [[G2288]] He was going [[G3195]] to die. [[G599]]

### 34
The [[G3588]] crowd [[G3793]] replied, [[G611]] “We [[G1473]] have heard [[G191]] from [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] Law [[G3551]] that [[G3754]] the [[G3588]] Christ [[G5547]] will remain [[G3306]] forever. [[G165]] [So] [[G2532]] how [[G4459]] {can} you [[G4771]] say [[G3004]] that [[G3754]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of Man [[G444]] must [[G1163]] be lifted up? [[G5312]] Who [[G5101]] is [[G1510]] this [[G3778]] Son [[G5207]] of Man? [[G444]]

### 35
Then [[G3767]] Jesus [[G2424]] told [[G2036]] them, [[G846]] “[For] [[G2089]] a little [[G3398]] while longer, [[G5550]] the [[G3588]] Light [[G5457]] will be [[G1510]] among [[G1722]] you. [[G4771]] Walk [[G4043]] while [[G5613]] you have [[G2192]] the [[G3588]] Light, [[G5457]] so that [[G2443]] darkness [[G4653]] will not overtake [[G2638]] you. [[G4771]] The [one who] [[G3588]] walks [[G4043]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] darkness [[G4653]] {does} not [[G3756]] know [[G1492]] where [[G4226]] he is going. [[G5217]]

### 36
While [[G5613]] you have [[G2192]] the [[G3588]] Light, [[G5457]] believe [[G4100]] in [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] Light, [[G5457]] so that [[G2443]] you may become [[G1096]] sons [[G5207]] of light.” [[G5457]] [After] Jesus [[G2424]] had spoken [[G2980]] these things, [[G3778]] He went away [[G565]] [and] was hidden [[G2928]] from [[G575]] them. [[G846]]

### 37
Although [[G1161]] [Jesus] [[G846]] had performed [[G4160]] so many [[G5118]] signs [[G4592]] in their presence, [[G1715]] they still did not believe [[G4100]] in [[G1519]] Him. [[G846]]

### 38
This was [[G2443]] to fulfill [[G4137]] the [[G3588]] word [[G3056]] of Isaiah [[G2268]] the [[G3588]] prophet: [[G4396]] “Lord, [[G2962]] who [[G5101]] has believed [[G4100]] our [[G1473]] message? [[G189]] And [[G2532]] to whom [[G5101]] {has} the [[G3588]] arm [[G1023]] of [the] Lord [[G2962]] been revealed?” [[G601]]

### 39
For this reason [[G1223]] they were unable [[G1410]] to believe. [[G4100]] For [[G3754]] again, [[G3825]] Isaiah [[G2268]] says: [[G2036]]

### 40
“He has blinded [[G5186]] their [[G846]] eyes [[G3788]] and [[G2532]] hardened [[G4456]] their [[G846]] hearts, [[G2588]] so that [[G2443]] they cannot see [[G3708]] with [their] [[G3588]] eyes, [[G3788]] and [[G2532]] understand [[G3539]] with [their] [[G3588]] hearts, [[G2588]] and [[G2532]] turn, [[G4762]] and [[G2532]] I would heal [[G2390]] them.” [[G846]]

### 41
Isaiah [[G2268]] said [[G2036]] these things [[G3778]] because [[G3754]] he saw [[G3708]] [Jesus’] [[G846]] glory [[G1391]] and [[G2532]] spoke [[G2980]] about [[G4012]] Him. [[G846]]

### 42
Nevertheless, [[G3676]] many [[G4183]] of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] leaders [[G758]] believed [[G4100]] in [[G1519]] Him; [[G846]] but [[G235]] because of [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] Pharisees [[G5330]] they did not confess [Him], [[G3670]] for fear that [[G2443]] they would be [[G1096]] put out of the synagogue. [[G656]]

### 43
For [[G1063]] they loved [[G25]] praise [[G1391]] from men [[G444]] more [[G3123]] than [[G2260]] praise [[G1391]] from God. [[G2316]]

### 44
Then [[G1161]] Jesus [[G2424]] cried out, [[G2896]] “Whoever [[G3588]] believes [[G4100]] in [[G1519]] Me [[G1473]] {does} not [[G3756]] believe [[G4100]] in [[G1519]] Me [alone], [[G1473]] but [[G235]] in [[G1519]] the [One who] [[G3588]] sent [[G3992]] Me. [[G1473]]

### 45
And [[G2532]] whoever [[G3588]] sees [[G2334]] Me [[G1473]] sees [[G2334]] the [One who] [[G3588]] sent [[G3992]] Me. [[G1473]]

### 46
I [[G1473]] have come [[G2064]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] world [[G2889]] [as] a light, [[G5457]] so that [[G2443]] no one [[G3956]] who [[G3588]] believes [[G4100]] in [[G1519]] Me [[G1473]] should remain [[G3306]] in [[G1722]] darkness. [[G4653]]

### 47
As for [[G1437]] anyone who [[G5100]] hears [[G191]] My [[G1473]] words [[G4487]] and [[G2532]] {does} not [[G3361]] keep [them], [[G5442]] I [[G1473]] {do} not [[G3756]] judge [[G2919]] him. [[G846]] For [[G1063]] I have not come [[G2064]] to [[G2443]] judge [[G2919]] the [[G3588]] world, [[G2889]] but [[G235]] to [[G2443]] save [[G4982]] the [[G3588]] world. [[G2889]]

### 48
There is [[G2192]] a judge [[G2919]] [for] [[G846]] the [one who] [[G3588]] rejects [[G114]] Me [[G1473]] and [[G2532]] does not receive [[G2983]] My [[G1473]] words: [[G4487]] The [[G3588]] word [[G3056]] that [[G3739]] I have spoken [[G2980]] will judge [[G2919]] him [[G846]] on [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] last [[G2078]] day. [[G2250]]

### 49
I [[G1473]] {have} not [[G3756]] spoken [[G2980]] on [[G1537]] My own, [[G1683]] but [[G235]] the [[G3588]] Father [[G3962]] [who] sent [[G3992]] Me [[G1473]] has commanded Me [[G1785]] what [[G5101]] to say [[G2036]] and [[G2532]] how [[G5101]] to say it. [[G2980]]

### 50
And [[G2532]] I know [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] His [[G846]] command [[G1785]] leads to [[G1510]] eternal [[G166]] life. [[G2222]] So [[G3767]] I [[G1473]] speak [[G2980]] exactly [[G2531]] what [[G3739]] the [[G3588]] Father [[G3962]] has told [[G2046]] Me [[G1473]] to say.” [[G2980]]
