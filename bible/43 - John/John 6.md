###### 1
After [[G3326]] this, [[G3778]] Jesus [[G2424]] crossed [[G565]] to the other side [[G4008]] of the [[G3588]] Sea [[G2281]] of Galilee [[G1056]] (that [is], [[G3588]] [the Sea] of Tiberias). [[G5085]]

###### 2
A large [[G4183]] crowd [[G3793]] followed [[G190]] Him [[G846]] because [[G3754]] they saw [[G2334]] the [[G3588]] signs [[G4592]] He had performed [[G4160]] on [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] sick. [[G770]]

###### 3
Then [[G1161]] Jesus [[G2424]] went up [[G424]] on [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] mountain [[G3735]] and [[G2532]] sat down [[G2521]] with [[G3326]] His [[G846]] disciples. [[G3101]]

###### 4
Now [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] Jewish [[G2453]] Feast [[G1859]] of the [[G3588]] Passover [[G3957]] was [[G1510]] near. [[G1451]]

###### 5
[When] [[G3767]] Jesus [[G2424]] looked up [[G1869]] and [[G2532]] saw [[G2300]] a large [[G4183]] crowd [[G3793]] coming [[G2064]] toward [[G4314]] Him, [[G846]] He said [[G3004]] to [[G4314]] Philip, [[G5376]] “Where [[G4159]] can we buy [[G59]] bread [[G740]] for [[G2443]] these [people] [[G3778]] to eat?” [[G5315]]

###### 6
But [[G1161]] He was asking [[G2036]] this [[G3778]] to test [[G3985]] him, [[G846]] for [[G1063]] He [[G846]] knew [[G1492]] what [[G5101]] He was about [[G3195]] to do. [[G4160]]

###### 7
Philip [[G5376]] answered, [[G611]] “Two hundred [[G1250]] denarii [[G1220]] would not [buy] enough [[G714]] bread [[G740]] for [[G846]] each {of them} [[G1538]] to have [[G2983]] a [[G5100]] small [piece].” [[G1024]]

###### 8
One [[G1520]] of [[G1537]] His [[G846]] disciples, [[G3101]] Andrew, [[G406]] Simon [[G4613]] Peter’s [[G4074]] brother, [[G80]] said [[G3004]] to Him, [[G846]]

###### 9
“Here [[G5602]] is [[G1510]] a boy [[G3808]] [with] [[G2192]] five [[G4002]] barley [[G2916]] loaves [[G740]] and [[G2532]] two [[G1417]] small fish. [[G3795]] But [[G235]] what [ difference ] [[G5101]] will these make [[G3778]] among [[G1519]] so many?” [[G5118]]

###### 10
“Have [[G4160]] the [[G3588]] [people] [[G444]] sit down,” [[G377]] Jesus [[G2424]] said. [[G2036]] Now [[G1161]] there was [[G1510]] plenty of [[G4183]] grass [[G5528]] in [[G1722]] [that] [[G3588]] place, [[G5117]] so [[G3767]] the [[G3588]] men [[G435]] sat down, [[G377]] about [[G5613]] five thousand [[G4000]] [of them]. [[G706]]

###### 11
Then [[G3767]] Jesus [[G2424]] took [[G2983]] the [[G3588]] loaves [[G740]] and [[G3668]] the [[G3588]] fish, [[G3795]] gave thanks, [[G2168]] [and] distributed [[G1239]] to those [[G3588]] who were seated [[G345]] as much as [[G3745]] they wanted. [[G2309]]

###### 12
And [[G1161]] when [[G5613]] everyone was full, [[G1705]] He said [[G3004]] to [[G3588]] His [[G846]] disciples, [[G3101]] “Gather [[G4863]] the [[G3588]] pieces [[G2801]] that are left over, [[G4052]] so that [[G2443]] nothing [[G5100]] will be wasted.” [[G622]]

###### 13
So [[G3767]] they collected [them] [[G4863]] and [[G2532]] filled [[G1072]] twelve [[G1427]] baskets [[G2894]] with the pieces [[G2801]] of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] five [[G4002]] barley [[G2916]] loaves [[G740]] left over [[G4052]] by those [[G3588]] who had eaten. [[G977]]

###### 14
[When] [[G3767]] the [[G3588]] people [[G444]] saw [[G3708]] the sign [[G4592]] that [[G3739]] [Jesus] had performed, [[G4160]] they began to say, [[G2036]] “Truly [[G230]] this [[G3778]] is [[G1510]] the [[G3588]] Prophet [[G4396]] who [[G3588]] is to come [[G2064]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] world.” [[G2889]]

###### 15
Then [[G3767]] Jesus, [[G2424]] realizing [[G1097]] that [[G3754]] they were about [[G3195]] to come [[G2064]] and [[G2532]] make [[G4160]] Him [[G846]] king [[G935]] by force, [[G726]] withdrew [[G402]] again [[G3825]] to [[G1519]] a mountain [[G3735]] by Himself. [[G846]]

###### 16
When [[G5613]] evening [[G3798]] came, [[G1096]] His [[G846]] disciples [[G3101]] went down [[G2597]] to [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] sea, [[G2281]]

###### 17
got into [[G1684]] a boat, [[G4143]] [and] started [[G2064]] across [[G4008]] the [[G3588]] sea [[G2281]] to [[G1519]] Capernaum. [[G2584]] It was [[G1096]] already [[G2235]] dark, [[G4653]] and [[G2532]] Jesus [[G2424]] had not yet gone out [[G2064]] to [[G4314]] them. [[G846]]

###### 18
A strong [[G3173]] wind [[G417]] was blowing [[G4154]] and [[G5037]] the [[G3588]] sea [[G2281]] grew agitated. [[G1326]]

###### 19
[When] [[G3767]] they had rowed [[G1643]] about [[G5613]] three or four miles, [[G1501]] they saw [[G2334]] Jesus [[G2424]] approaching [[G1096]] the [[G3588]] boat, [[G4143]] walking [[G4043]] on [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] sea— [[G2281]] and [[G2532]] they were terrified. [[G5399]]

###### 20
But [[G1161]] [Jesus] spoke up: [[G3004]] “It is [[G1510]] I; [[G1473]] {do} not [[G3361]] be afraid.” [[G5399]]

###### 21
Then [[G3767]] they were willing [[G2309]] to take [[G2983]] Him [[G846]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] boat, [[G4143]] and [[G2532]] at once [[G2112]] the [[G3588]] boat [[G4143]] reached [[G1096]] the [[G3588]] shore [[G1093]] where [[G3739]] they were heading. [[G5217]]

###### 22
The [[G3588]] next day, [[G1887]] the [[G3588]] crowd [[G3793]] that [[G3588]] had remained [[G2476]] on the other side [[G4008]] of the [[G3588]] sea [[G2281]] realized [[G3708]] that [[G3754]] only [[G1487]] one [[G1520]] boat [[G4142]] had been [[G1510]] there, [[G1563]] and [[G2532]] that [[G3754]] Jesus [[G2424]] had not boarded [[G4897]] [it] [[G4143]] {with} His [[G846]] disciples, [[G3101]] but [[G235]] [they] [[G3101]] had gone away [[G565]] alone. [[G3441]]

###### 23
However, [[G235]] [some] boats [[G4142]] from [[G1537]] Tiberias [[G5085]] arrived [[G2064]] near [[G1451]] the [[G3588]] place [[G5117]] they had eaten [[G5315]] the [[G3588]] bread [[G740]] [after] the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] had given thanks. [[G2168]]

###### 24
So [[G3767]] when [[G3753]] the [[G3588]] crowd [[G3793]] saw [[G3708]] that [[G3754]] neither [[G3756]] Jesus [[G2424]] nor [[G3761]] His [[G846]] disciples [[G3101]] were [[G1510]] there, [[G1563]] they [[G846]] got [[G1684]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] boats [[G4142]] and [[G2532]] went [[G2064]] to [[G1519]] Capernaum [[G2584]] to look for [[G2212]] [Him]. [[G2424]]

###### 25
[When] [[G2532]] they found [[G2147]] Him [[G846]] on the other side [[G4008]] of the [[G3588]] sea, [[G2281]] they asked [[G2036]] Him, [[G846]] “Rabbi, [[G4461]] when [[G4219]] did You get [[G1096]] here?” [[G5602]]

###### 26
Jesus [[G2424]] replied, [[G611]] “Truly, [[G281]] truly, [[G281]] I tell [[G3004]] you, [[G4771]] [it is] not [[G3756]] because [[G3754]] you saw [[G3708]] [these] signs [[G4592]] [that] you are looking for [[G2212]] Me, [[G1473]] but [[G235]] because [[G3754]] you ate [[G5315]] the [[G3588]] loaves [[G740]] and [[G2532]] had your fill. [[G5526]]

###### 27
{Do} not [[G3361]] work [for] [[G2038]] food [[G1035]] that [[G3588]] perishes, [[G622]] but [for] [[G235]] food [[G1035]] that [[G3588]] endures [[G3306]] to [[G1519]] eternal [[G166]] life, [[G2222]] which [[G3739]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of Man [[G444]] will give [[G1325]] you. [[G4771]] For [[G1063]] on Him [[G3778]] God [[G2316]] the [[G3588]] Father [[G3962]] has placed His seal of approval. [[G4972]]

###### 28
Then [[G3767]] they inquired, [[G2036]] “What [[G5101]] must we do [[G4160]] to [[G2443]] perform [[G2038]] the [[G3588]] works [[G2041]] of God?” [[G2316]]

###### 29
Jesus [[G2424]] replied, [[G611]] “The [[G3588]] work [[G2041]] of God [[G2316]] is [[G1510]] this: [[G3778]] to [[G2443]] believe [[G4100]] in [[G1519]] the [One] [[G3739]] He [[G1565]] has sent.” [[G649]]

###### 30
So [[G3767]] they asked [[G2036]] Him, [[G846]] “What [[G5101]] sign [[G4592]] then [[G3767]] {will} You [[G4771]] perform, [[G4160]] so that [[G2443]] we may see [it] [[G3708]] and [[G2532]] believe [[G4100]] You? [[G4771]] What [[G5101]] will You do? [[G2038]]

###### 31
Our [[G1473]] forefathers [[G3962]] ate [[G5315]] the [[G3588]] manna [[G3131]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] wilderness, [[G2048]] as [[G2531]] it is [[G1510]] written: [[G1125]] ‘He gave [[G1325]] them [[G846]] bread [[G740]] from [[G1537]] heaven [[G3772]] to eat.’” [[G5315]]

###### 32
Jesus [[G2424]] said [[G2036]] to them, [[G846]] “Truly, [[G281]] truly, [[G281]] I tell [[G3004]] you, [[G4771]] [it was] not [[G3756]] Moses [[G3475]] [who] gave [[G1325]] you [[G4771]] the [[G3588]] bread [[G740]] from [[G1537]] heaven, [[G3772]] but [it is] [[G235]] My [[G1473]] Father [[G3962]] [who] gives [[G1325]] you [[G4771]] the [[G3588]] TRUE [[G228]] bread [[G740]] from [[G1537]] heaven. [[G3772]]

###### 33
For [[G1063]] the [[G3588]] bread [[G740]] of God [[G2316]] is [[G1510]] He who [[G3588]] comes down [[G2597]] from [[G1537]] heaven [[G3772]] and [[G2532]] gives [[G1325]] life [[G2222]] to the [[G3588]] world.” [[G2889]]

###### 34
“Sir,” [[G2962]] they said, [[G2036]] “give [[G1325]] us [[G1473]] this [[G3778]] bread [[G740]] at all times.” [[G3842]]

###### 35
Jesus [[G2424]] answered, [[G2036]] “I [[G1473]] am [[G1510]] the [[G3588]] bread [[G740]] of life. [[G2222]] Whoever [[G3588]] comes [[G2064]] to [[G4314]] Me [[G1473]] will never hunger, [[G3983]] and [[G2532]] whoever [[G3588]] believes [[G4100]] in [[G1519]] Me [[G1473]] will never thirst. [[G1372]]

###### 36
But [[G235]] [as] I told [[G2036]] you, [[G4771]] you have seen [[G3708]] Me [[G1473]] and still [[G2532]] {you do} not [[G3756]] believe. [[G4100]]

###### 37
Everyone [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] Father [[G3962]] gives [[G1325]] Me [[G1473]] will come [[G2240]] to [[G4314]] Me, [[G1473]] and [[G2532]] the [one who] [[G3588]] comes [[G2064]] to [[G4314]] Me [[G1473]] I will never drive [[G1544]] away. [[G1854]]

###### 38
For [[G3754]] I have come down [[G2597]] from [[G575]] heaven, [[G3772]] not [[G3756]] to [[G2443]] do [[G4160]] My [[G1699]] [own] [[G3588]] will, [[G2307]] but [to do] [[G235]] the [[G3588]] will [[G2307]] of Him who [[G3588]] sent [[G3992]] Me. [[G1473]]

###### 39
And [[G1161]] this [[G3778]] is [[G1510]] the [[G3588]] will [[G2307]] of Him who [[G3588]] sent [[G3992]] Me, [[G1473]] that [[G2443]] I shall lose [[G622]] none [[G3361]] of [[G1537]] those [[G3739]] He has given [[G1325]] Me, [[G1473]] but [[G235]] raise them up [[G450]] at [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] last [[G2078]] day. [[G2250]]

###### 40
For [[G1063]] it [[G3778]] is [[G1510]] My [[G1473]] Father’s [[G3962]] will [[G2307]] that [[G2443]] everyone [[G3956]] who [[G3588]] looks to [[G2334]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] and [[G2532]] believes [[G4100]] in [[G1519]] Him [[G846]] shall have [[G2192]] eternal [[G166]] life, [[G2222]] and [[G2532]] I [[G1473]] will raise him up [[G450]] at [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] last [[G2078]] day. [[G2250]]

###### 41
At this, [[G3767]] the [[G3588]] Jews [[G2453]] began to grumble [[G1111]] about [[G4012]] [Jesus] [[G846]] because [[G3754]] He had said, [[G2036]] “I [[G1473]] am [[G1510]] the [[G3588]] bread [[G740]] that [[G3588]] came down [[G2597]] from [[G1537]] heaven.” [[G3772]]

###### 42
They were asking, [[G2036]] “Is [[G1510]] this [[G3778]] not [[G3756]] Jesus, [[G2424]] the [[G3588]] son [[G5207]] of Joseph, [[G2501]] whose [[G3739]] father [[G3962]] and [[G2532]] mother [[G3384]] we [[G1473]] know? [[G1492]] How [[G4459]] then [[G3568]] can He say, [[G3004]] ‘I have come down [[G2597]] from [[G1537]] heaven?’” [[G3772]]

###### 43
“Stop [[G3361]] grumbling [[G1111]] among [[G3326]] yourselves,” [[G240]] Jesus [[G2424]] replied. [[G611]]

###### 44
“No one [[G3762]] can [[G1410]] come [[G2064]] to [[G4314]] Me [[G1473]] unless [[G1437]] the [[G3588]] Father [[G3962]] who [[G3588]] sent [[G3992]] Me [[G1473]] draws [[G1670]] him, [[G846]] and I [[G2504]] will raise him up [[G450]] at [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] last [[G2078]] day. [[G2250]]

###### 45
It is [[G1510]] written [[G1125]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] Prophets: [[G4396]] ‘And [[G2532]] they will all be [[G1510]] taught [[G1318]] by God.’ [[G2316]] Everyone [[G3956]] who [[G3588]] has heard [[G191]] the [[G3588]] Father [[G3962]] and [[G2532]] learned [[G3129]] from [Him] [[G3844]] comes [[G2064]] to [[G4314]] Me— [[G1473]]

###### 46
not [[G3756]] that [[G3754]] anyone [[G5100]] has seen [[G3708]] the [[G3588]] Father [[G3962]] except [[G1487]] the [One who] [[G3588]] is [[G1510]] from [[G3844]] God; [[G2316]] [only] He [[G3778]] has seen [[G3708]] the [[G3588]] Father. [[G3962]]

###### 47
Truly, [[G281]] truly, [[G281]] I tell [[G3004]] you, [[G4771]] he who [[G3588]] believes [[G4100]] has [[G2192]] eternal [[G166]] life. [[G2222]]

###### 48
I [[G1473]] am [[G1510]] the [[G3588]] bread [[G740]] of life. [[G2222]]

###### 49
Your [[G4771]] forefathers [[G3962]] ate [[G5315]] the [[G3588]] manna [[G3131]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] wilderness, [[G2048]] yet [[G2532]] they died. [[G599]]

###### 50
This [[G3778]] is [[G1510]] the [[G3588]] bread [[G740]] that [[G3588]] comes down [[G2597]] from [[G1537]] heaven, [[G3772]] so that [[G2443]] anyone [[G5100]] may eat [[G5315]] of [[G1537]] it [[G846]] and [[G2532]] not [[G3361]] die. [[G599]]

###### 51
I [[G1473]] am [[G1510]] the [[G3588]] living [[G2198]] bread [[G740]] that [[G3588]] came down [[G2597]] from [[G1537]] heaven. [[G3772]] If [[G1437]] anyone [[G5100]] eats [[G5315]] of [[G1537]] this [[G3778]] bread, [[G740]] he will live [[G2198]] forever. [[G165]] And [[G2532]] [this] [[G3588]] bread, [[G740]] which [[G3739]] I [[G1473]] will give [[G1325]] for [[G5228]] the [[G3588]] life [[G2222]] of the [[G3588]] world, [[G2889]] is [[G1510]] My [[G1473]] flesh. [[G4561]]

###### 52
At this, [[G3767]] the [[G3588]] Jews [[G2453]] began to argue [[G3164]] among [[G4314]] themselves, [[G240]] “How [[G4459]] can [[G1410]] this [man] [[G3778]] give [[G1325]] us [[G1473]] His [[G846]] flesh [[G4561]] to eat?” [[G5315]]

###### 53
So [[G3767]] Jesus [[G2424]] said [[G2036]] to them, [[G846]] “Truly, [[G281]] truly, [[G281]] I tell [[G3004]] you, [[G4771]] unless [[G1437]] you eat [[G5315]] the [[G3588]] flesh [[G4561]] and [[G2532]] drink [[G4095]] the [[G3588]] blood [[G129]] of the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of Man, [[G444]] you have [[G2192]] no [[G3756]] life [[G2222]] in [[G1722]] you. [[G1438]]

###### 54
Whoever [[G3588]] eats [[G5176]] My [[G1473]] flesh [[G4561]] and [[G2532]] drinks [[G4095]] My [[G1473]] blood [[G129]] has [[G2192]] eternal [[G166]] life, [[G2222]] and I [[G2504]] will raise him up [[G450]] at the [[G3588]] last [[G2078]] day. [[G2250]]

###### 55
For [[G1063]] My [[G1473]] flesh [[G4561]] is [[G1510]] real [[G227]] food, [[G1035]] and [[G2532]] My [[G1473]] blood [[G129]] is [[G1510]] real [[G227]] drink. [[G4213]]

###### 56
Whoever [[G3588]] eats [[G5176]] My [[G1473]] flesh [[G4561]] and [[G2532]] drinks [[G4095]] My [[G1473]] blood [[G129]] remains [[G3306]] in [[G1722]] Me, [[G1473]] and I [[G2504]] in [[G1722]] him. [[G846]]

###### 57
Just as [[G2531]] the [[G3588]] living [[G2198]] Father [[G3962]] sent [[G649]] Me [[G1473]] and I [[G2504]] live [[G2198]] because of [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] Father, [[G3962]] so [[G2532]] also [[G2548]] the [one who] [[G3588]] feeds on [[G5176]] Me [[G1473]] will live [[G2198]] because of [[G1223]] Me. [[G1473]]

###### 58
This [[G3778]] is [[G1510]] the [[G3588]] bread [[G740]] that [[G3588]] came down [[G2597]] from [[G1537]] heaven. [[G3772]] Unlike [[G3756]] [your] [[G3588]] forefathers, [[G3962]] [who] ate [ the manna ] [[G5315]] and [[G2532]] died, [[G599]] the [one who] [[G3588]] eats [[G5176]] this [[G3778]] bread [[G740]] will live [[G2198]] forever.” [[G165]]

###### 59
[Jesus] said [[G2036]] this [[G3778]] while teaching [[G1321]] in [[G1722]] [the] synagogue [[G4864]] in [[G1722]] Capernaum. [[G2584]]

###### 60
On hearing [it], [[G191]] many [[G4183]] of [[G1537]] His [[G846]] disciples [[G3101]] said, [[G2036]] “This [[G3778]] is [[G1510]] a difficult [[G4642]] teaching. [[G3056]] Who [[G5101]] can [[G1410]] accept [[G191]] it?” [[G846]]

###### 61
Aware [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] His [[G846]] disciples [[G3101]] were grumbling [[G1111]] about [[G4012]] this [ teaching ], [[G3778]] Jesus [[G2424]] asked [[G2036]] them, [[G846]] “{Does} this [[G3778]] offend [[G4624]] you? [[G4771]]

###### 62
Then [[G3767]] what [ will happen ] if [[G1437]] you see [[G2334]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of Man [[G444]] ascend [[G305]] to where [[G3699]] He was [[G1510]] before? [[G4386]]

###### 63
The [[G3588]] Spirit [[G4151]] gives life; [[G2227]] the [[G3588]] flesh [[G4561]] profits [[G5623]] nothing. [[G3762]] The [[G3588]] words [[G4487]] I [[G1473]] have spoken [[G2980]] to you [[G4771]] are [[G1510]] spirit [[G4151]] and [[G2532]] they are [[G1510]] life. [[G2222]]

###### 64
However, [[G235]] there are [[G1510]] some [[G5100]] of [[G1537]] you [[G4771]] who [[G3739]] do not believe.” [[G4100]] (For [[G1063]] Jesus [[G2424]] had known [[G1492]] from [[G1537]] [the] beginning [[G746]] which [[G5101]] of them [[G3588]] did not believe [[G4100]] and [[G2532]] who [[G5101]] would betray [[G3860]] Him.) [[G846]]

###### 65
Then [[G2532]] [Jesus] said, [[G2036]] “This [[G3778]] is why [[G1223]] I told [[G2046]] you [[G4771]] that [[G3754]] no one [[G3762]] can [[G1410]] come [[G2064]] to [[G4314]] Me [[G1473]] unless [[G1437]] the [[G3588]] Father [[G3962]] has granted it [[G1325]] to him.” [[G846]]

###### 66
From [[G1537]] that [time on], [[G3778]] many [[G4183]] of [[G1537]] His [[G846]] disciples [[G3101]] turned back [[G565]] and [[G2532]] no longer [[G3765]] walked [[G4043]] with [[G3326]] Him. [[G846]]

###### 67
So [[G3767]] Jesus [[G2424]] asked [[G2036]] the [[G3588]] Twelve, [[G1427]] “Do you [[G4771]] want [[G2309]] to leave [[G5217]] too?” [[G2532]]

###### 68
Simon [[G4613]] Peter [[G4074]] replied, [[G611]] “Lord, [[G2962]] to [[G4314]] whom [[G5101]] would we go? [[G565]] You have [[G2192]] [the] words [[G4487]] of eternal [[G166]] life. [[G2222]]

###### 69
We [[G1473]] believe [[G4100]] and [[G2532]] know [[G1097]] that [[G3754]] You [[G4771]] are [[G1510]] the [[G3588]] Holy One [[G40]] of God.” [[G2316]]

###### 70
Jesus [[G2424]] answered [[G611]] them, [[G846]] “{Have} I [[G1473]] not [[G3756]] chosen [[G1586]] you, [[G4771]] the [[G3588]] Twelve? [[G1427]] Yet [[G2532]] one [[G1520]] of [[G1537]] you [[G4771]] is [[G1510]] a devil!” [[G1228]]

###### 71
He was speaking [[G2036]] about Judas, [[G2455]] [the son] of Simon [[G4613]] Iscariot. [[G2469]] For [although] [[G1063]] [Judas was] [[G3778]] one [[G1520]] of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] Twelve, [[G1427]] {he was} later [[G3195]] to betray [[G3860]] [Jesus]. [[G846]]
