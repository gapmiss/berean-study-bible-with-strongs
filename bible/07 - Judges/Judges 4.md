###### 1
After Ehud [[H164]] died, [[H4191]] the Israelites [[H1121]] again [[H3254]] did [[H6213]] evil [[H7451]] in the sight [[H5869]] of the LORD. [[H3068]]

###### 2
So the LORD [[H3068]] sold them [[H4376]] into the hands [[H3027]] of Jabin [[H2985]] king [[H4428]] of Canaan, [[H3667]] who [[H834]] reigned [[H4427]] in Hazor. [[H2674]] The commander [[H8269]] of his forces [[H6635]] was Sisera, [[H5516]] who [[H1931]] lived [[H3427]] in Harosheth-hagoyim. [[H2800]]

###### 3
Then the Israelites [[H1121]] cried out [[H6817]] to [[H413]] the LORD, [[H3068]] because [[H3588]] Jabin had  nine [[H8672]] hundred [[H3967]] chariots [[H7393]] of iron, [[H1270]] and he [[H1931]] had harshly [[H2394]] oppressed [[H3905]] the Israelites [[H1121]] for twenty [[H6242]] years. [[H8141]]

###### 4
Now Deborah, [[H1683]] a prophetess, [[H5031]] the wife [[H802]] of Lappidoth, [[H3941]] was judging [[H8199]] Israel [[H3478]] at that [[H1931]] time. [[H6256]]

###### 5
And she [[H1931]] would sit [[H3427]] under [[H8478]] the Palm [[H8560]] of Deborah [[H1683]] between [[H996]] Ramah [[H7414]] and Bethel [[H1008]] in the hill country [[H2022]] of Ephraim, [[H669]] where the Israelites [[H1121]] would go up [[H5927]] to her [[H413]] for judgment. [[H4941]]

###### 6
She summoned [[H7971]] Barak [[H1301]] son [[H1121]] of Abinoam [[H42]] from Kedesh [[H6943]] in Naphtali [[H5321]] and said [[H559]] to him, [[H413]] “Has not [[H3808]] the LORD, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] commanded you: [[H6680]] ‘Go, [[H1980]] and march [[H4900]] to Mount [[H2022]] Tabor, [[H8396]] taking [[H3947]] with you [[H5973]] ten [[H6235]] thousand [[H505]] men [[H376]] of Naphtali [[H5321]] and Zebulun? [[H2074]]

###### 7
And I will draw out [[H4900]] Sisera [[H5516]] the commander [[H8269]] of Jabin’s [[H2985]] army, [[H6635]] his chariots, [[H7393]] and his troops [[H1995]] to [[H413]] the River [[H5158]] Kishon, [[H7028]] and I will deliver him [[H5414]] into your hands.’” [[H3027]]

###### 8
Barak [[H1301]] said [[H559]] to her, [[H413]] “If [[H518]] you will go [[H1980]] with me, [[H5973]] I will go; [[H1980]] but if [[H518]] you will not [[H3808]] go [[H1980]] with me, [[H5973]] I will not [[H3808]] go.” [[H1980]]

###### 9
“I will certainly go [[H1980]] with you,” [[H5973]] Deborah replied, [[H559]] “but [[H657]] the road [[H1870]] you [are taking] [[H859]] will bring you [[H1961]] no [[H3808]] honor, [[H8597]] because [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] will be selling [[H4376]] Sisera [[H5516]] into the hand [[H3027]] of a woman.” [[H802]] So Deborah [[H1683]] got up [[H6965]] and went [[H1980]] with [[H5973]] Barak [[H1301]] to Kedesh, [[H6943]]

###### 10
where he [[H1301]] summoned [[H2199]] Zebulun [[H2074]] and Naphtali; [[H5321]] ten [[H6235]] thousand [[H505]] men [[H376]] followed [[H5927]] him, [[H7272]] and Deborah [[H1683]] also went [[H5927]] with him. [[H5973]]

###### 11
Now Heber [[H2268]] the Kenite [[H7017]] had moved away [[H6504]] from the Kenites, [[H7017]] the descendants [[H1121]] of Hobab [[H2246]] the father-in-law [[H2859]] of Moses, [[H4872]] and had pitched [[H5186]] his tent [[H168]] by [[H5704]] the great tree [[H436]] of Zaanannim, [[H6815]] which [[H834]] was near [[H854]] Kedesh. [[H6943]]

###### 12
When it was reported [[H5046]] to Sisera [[H5516]] that [[H3588]] Barak [[H1301]] son [[H1121]] of Abinoam [[H42]] had gone up [[H5927]] Mount [[H2022]] Tabor, [[H8396]]

###### 13
[he] [[H5516]] summoned [[H2199]] all [[H3605]] nine [[H8672]] hundred [[H3967]] of his iron [[H1270]] chariots [[H7393]] and all [[H3605]] the men [[H5971]] with him, [[H854]] from Harosheth-hagoyim [[H2800]] to [[H413]] the River [[H5158]] Kishon. [[H7028]]

###### 14
Then Deborah [[H1683]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Barak, [[H1301]] “Arise, [[H6965]] for [[H3588]] this [[H2088]] is the day [[H3117]] the LORD [[H3068]] has delivered [[H5414]] Sisera [[H5516]] into your hands. [[H3027]] Has not [[H3808]] the LORD [[H3068]] gone [[H3318]] before you?” [[H6440]] So Barak [[H1301]] came down [[H3381]] from Mount [[H2022]] Tabor [[H8396]] with ten [[H6235]] thousand [[H505]] men [[H376]] following him. [[H310]]

###### 15
And in front of [[H6440]] [him] [[H1301]] the LORD [[H3068]] routed [[H2000]] with the sword [[H2719]] Sisera, [[H5516]] all [[H3605]] his charioteers, [[H7393]] and all [[H3605]] his army. [[H4264]] Sisera [[H5516]] abandoned [[H3381]] his chariot [[H4818]] and fled [[H5127]] on foot. [[H7272]]

###### 16
Barak [[H1301]] pursued [[H7291]] the chariots [[H7393]] and army [[H4264]] as far as [[H5704]] Harosheth-hagoyim, [[H2800]] and the whole [[H3605]] army [[H4264]] of Sisera [[H5516]] fell [[H5307]] by the sword; [[H2719]] not [[H3808]] a single [[H259]] man was left. [[H7604]]

###### 17
Meanwhile, Sisera [[H5516]] had fled [[H5127]] on foot [[H7272]] to [[H413]] the tent [[H168]] of Jael, [[H3278]] the wife [[H802]] of Heber [[H2268]] the Kenite, [[H7017]] because [[H3588]] there was peace [[H7965]] between [[H996]] Jabin [[H2985]] king [[H4428]] of Hazor [[H2674]] and [[H996]] the house [[H1004]] of Heber [[H2268]] the Kenite. [[H7017]]

###### 18
Jael [[H3278]] went out to greet [[H3318]] Sisera [[H5516]] and said [[H559]] to him, [[H413]] “Come in, [[H5493]] my lord. [[H113]] Come in [[H5493]] with me. [[H413]] Do not [[H408]] be afraid.” [[H3372]] So he went [[H5493]] into her tent, [[H168]] and she covered him [[H3680]] with a blanket. [[H8063]]

###### 19
[Sisera] said [[H559]] to her, [[H413]] “Please [[H4994]] give me a little [[H4592]] water [[H4325]] to drink, [[H8248]] for [[H3588]] I am thirsty.” [[H6770]] So she opened [[H6605]] a container [[H4997]] of milk, [[H2461]] gave him a drink, [[H8248]] and covered him again. [[H3680]]

###### 20
“Stand [[H5975]] at the entrance [[H6607]] to the tent,” [[H168]] he said, [[H559]] “and [[H1961]] if [[H518]] anyone [[H376]] comes [[H935]] and asks you, [[H7592]] ‘Is there [[H3426]] a man [[H376]] here?’ [[H6311]] say, [[H559]] ‘No.’” [[H369]]

###### 21
But as he [[H1931]] lay sleeping [[H7290]] from exhaustion, [[H5774]] Heber’s [[H2268]] wife [[H802]] Jael [[H3278]] took [[H3947]] a tent [[H168]] peg, [[H3489]] grabbed [[H7760]] a hammer, [[H4718]] and went [[H935]] silently [[H3909]] to Sisera. [[H413]] She drove [[H8628]] the peg [[H3489]] through his temple [[H7541]] [and] [[H6795]] into the ground, [[H776]] and he died. [[H4191]]

###### 22
When Barak [[H1301]] arrived in pursuit of [[H7291]] Sisera, [[H5516]] Jael [[H3278]] went out [[H3318]] to greet him [[H7125]] and said [[H559]] to him,  “Come, [[H1980]] and I will show you [[H7200]] the man [[H376]] you [[H859]] are seeking.” [[H1245]] So he went in [[H935]] with her, [[H413]] and there [[H2009]] lay [[H5307]] Sisera [[H5516]] dead, [[H4191]] with a tent peg [[H3489]] through his temple. [[H7541]]

###### 23
On that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] God [[H430]] subdued [[H3665]] Jabin [[H2985]] king [[H4428]] of Canaan [[H3667]] before [[H6440]] the Israelites. [[H1121]]

###### 24
And the hand [[H3027]] of the Israelites [[H1121]] grew stronger [[H1980]] and stronger [[H7186]] against [[H5921]] Jabin [[H2985]] king [[H4428]] of Canaan [[H3667]] until [[H5704]] they destroyed [[H3772]] him. [[H2985]]
