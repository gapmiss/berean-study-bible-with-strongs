[[Joshua 24|←]] • [[Judges 2|→]]

### 1
After [[H310]] the death [[H4194]] of Joshua, [[H3091]] the Israelites [[H1121]] inquired [[H7592]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] “Who [[H4310]] will be the first [[H8462]] to go up [[H5927]] and fight [[H3898]] for us  against [[H413]] the Canaanites?” [[H3669]]

### 2
The LORD [[H3068]] answered, [[H559]] “Judah [[H3063]] shall go up. [[H5927]] Indeed, [[H2009]] I have delivered [[H5414]] the land [[H776]] into their hands.” [[H3027]]

### 3
Then the men of Judah [[H3063]] said [[H559]] to their brothers [[H251]] the Simeonites, [[H8095]] “Come up [[H5927]] with us [[H854]] to our allotted territory, [[H1486]] and let us fight [[H3898]] against the Canaanites. [[H3669]] And we [[H589]] likewise [[H1571]] will go [[H1980]] with you [[H854]] to your territory.” [[H1486]] So the Simeonites [[H8095]] went [[H1980]] with them. [[H854]]

### 4
When Judah [[H3063]] attacked, [[H5927]] the LORD [[H3068]] delivered [[H5414]] the Canaanites [[H3669]] and Perizzites [[H6522]] into their hands, [[H3027]] and they struck down [[H5221]] ten [[H6235]] thousand [[H505]] men [[H376]] at Bezek. [[H966]]

### 5
And [there] [[H966]] they found [[H4672]] Adoni-bezek [[H137]] and fought [[H3898]] against him,  striking down [[H5221]] the Canaanites [[H3669]] and Perizzites. [[H6522]]

### 6
As Adoni-bezek [[H137]] fled, [[H5127]] they pursued him, [[H7291]] seized him, [[H270]] and cut off [[H7112]] his thumbs [[H931]] and big toes. [[H7272]]

### 7
Then Adoni-bezek [[H137]] said, [[H559]] “Seventy [[H7657]] kings [[H4428]] with their thumbs [[H931]] and big toes [[H7272]] cut off [[H7112]] have gathered [the scraps] [[H3950]] under [[H8478]] my table. [[H7979]] As [[H834]] I have done, [[H6213]] so [[H3651]] God [[H430]] has repaid [[H7999]] me.”  And they brought him [[H935]] to Jerusalem, [[H3389]] where he died. [[H4191]]

### 8
Then the men [[H1121]] of Judah [[H3063]] fought [[H3898]] against Jerusalem [[H3389]] and captured it. [[H3920]] They put [[H5221]] [the city] to the sword [[H2719]] and set [[H7971]] it [[H5892]] on fire. [[H784]]

### 9
Afterward, [[H310]] the men [[H1121]] of Judah [[H3063]] marched down [[H3381]] to fight [[H3898]] against the Canaanites [[H3669]] living [[H3427]] in the hill country, [[H2022]] in the Negev, [[H5045]] and in the foothills. [[H8219]]

### 10
Judah [[H3063]] also marched [[H1980]] against [[H413]] the Canaanites [[H3669]] who were living [[H3427]] in Hebron [[H2275]] ( [[H2275]] formerly [[H6440]] known as [[H8034]] Kiriath-arba), [[H7153]] and they struck down [[H5221]] Sheshai, [[H8344]] Ahiman, [[H289]] and Talmai. [[H8526]]

### 11
From there [[H8033]] they marched [[H1980]] against [[H413]] the residents [[H3427]] of Debir [[H1688]] ( [[H1688]] formerly [[H6440]] known as [[H8034]] Kiriath-sepher). [[H7158]]

### 12
And Caleb [[H3612]] said, [[H559]] “To the man [[H834]] who strikes down [[H5221]] Kiriath-sepher [[H7158]] and captures it, [[H3920]] I will give [[H5414]] my daughter [[H1323]] Acsah [[H5915]] in marriage.” [[H802]]

### 13
So Othniel [[H6274]] son [[H1121]] of Kenaz, [[H7073]] Caleb’s [[H3612]] younger [[H6996]] brother, [[H251]] captured it, [[H3920]] and Caleb gave [[H5414]] his daughter [[H1323]] Acsah [[H5915]] to him  in marriage. [[H802]]

### 14
One day [[H1961]] [Acsah] came [to Othniel] [[H935]] and urged him [[H5496]] to ask [[H7592]] her father [[H1]] for a field. [[H7704]] When she got off [[H6795]] her donkey, [[H2543]] Caleb [[H3612]] asked her, [[H559]] “What [[H4100]] do you desire?” 

### 15
“Give [[H3051]] me a blessing,” [[H1293]] she answered. [[H559]] “Since [[H3588]] you have given me [[H5414]] land [[H776]] in the Negev, [[H5045]] give [[H5414]] me  springs [[H1543]] of water [as well].” [[H4325]] So Caleb [[H3612]] gave [[H5414]] her both the upper [[H5942]] and lower [[H8482]] springs. [[H1543]]

### 16
Now the descendants [[H1121]] of Moses’ [[H4872]] father-in-law, [[H2859]] the Kenite, [[H7017]] went up [[H5927]] with [[H854]] the men [[H1121]] of Judah [[H3063]] from the City [[H5892]] of Palms [[H8558]] to the Wilderness [[H4057]] of Judah [[H3063]] in the Negev [[H5045]] near Arad. [[H6166]] They went [[H1980]] to live [[H3427]] among [[H854]] the people. [[H5971]]

### 17
Then the men of Judah [[H3063]] went [[H1980]] with [[H854]] their brothers [[H251]] the Simeonites, [[H8095]] struck [[H5221]] the Canaanites [[H3669]] who were living [[H3427]] in Zephath, [[H6857]] and completely destroyed [[H2763]] [the city]. [[H853]] So [it] was called [[H7121]] Hormah. [[H2767]]

### 18
And Judah [[H3063]] also captured [[H3920]] Gaza, [[H5804]] Ashkelon, [[H831]] and Ekron— [[H6138]] each with [[H853]] its territory. [[H1366]]

### 19
The LORD [[H3068]] was [[H1961]] with [[H854]] Judah, [[H3063]] and they took possession [[H3423]] of the hill country; [[H2022]] but [[H3588]] they could not [[H3808]] drive out [[H3423]] the inhabitants [[H3427]] of the plains, [[H6010]] because [[H3588]] they had  chariots [[H7393]] of iron. [[H1270]]

### 20
Just as [[H834]] Moses [[H4872]] had promised, [[H1696]] Judah gave [[H5414]] Hebron [[H2275]] to Caleb, [[H3612]] who drove out [[H3423]] [the descendants of] the three [[H7969]] sons [[H1121]] of Anak. [[H6061]]

### 21
The Benjamites, [[H1121]] however, [[H853]] failed to [[H3808]] drive out [[H3423]] the Jebusites [[H2983]] living [[H3427]] in Jerusalem. [[H3389]] And to [[H5704]] this [[H2088]] day [[H3117]] the Jebusites [[H2983]] dwell [[H3427]] among [[H854]] the Benjamites [[H1121]] in Jerusalem. [[H3389]]

### 22
The house [[H1004]] of Joseph [[H3130]] also [[H1571]] attacked [[H5927]] Bethel, [[H1008]] and the LORD [[H3068]] was with them. [[H5973]]

### 23
They [[H1004]] sent spies [[H8446]] to Bethel [[H1008]] ( [[H5892]] formerly [[H6440]] known as [[H8034]] Luz), [[H3870]]

### 24
and when the spies [[H8104]] saw [[H7200]] a man [[H376]] coming out [[H3318]] of [[H4480]] the city, [[H5892]] they said [[H559]] to him,  “Please [[H4994]] show [[H7200]] us how to get into [[H3996]] the city, [[H5892]] and we will treat [[H6213]] you [[H5973]] kindly.” [[H2617]]

### 25
So [the man] showed them [[H7200]] the entrance [[H3996]] to the city, [[H5892]] and they put [[H5221]] the city [[H5892]] to the sword [[H2719]] but released [[H7971]] that man [[H376]] and all [[H3605]] his family. [[H4940]]

### 26
And the man [[H376]] went [[H1980]] to the land [[H776]] of the Hittites, [[H2850]] built [[H1129]] a city, [[H5892]] and called it [[H7121]] Luz, [[H3870]] which [[H1931]] is its name [[H8034]] to [[H5704]] this [[H2088]] day. [[H3117]]

### 27
At that time Manasseh [[H4519]] failed [[H3808]] to drive out the inhabitants [[H3423]] of Beth-shean, [[H1052]] Taanach, [[H8590]] Dor, [[H1756]] Ibleam, [[H2991]] [and] [[H853]] Megiddo, [[H4023]] or any of their villages; [[H1323]] for the Canaanites [[H3669]] were determined [[H2974]] to dwell [[H3427]] in this [[H2063]] land. [[H776]]

### 28
When [[H3588]] Israel [[H3478]] became stronger, [[H2388]] they pressed [[H7760]] the Canaanites [[H3669]] into forced labor, [[H4522]] but they never [[H3808]] drove them out [[H3423]] completely. [[H3423]]

### 29
Ephraim [[H669]] also failed [[H3808]] to drive out [[H3423]] the Canaanites [[H3669]] living [[H3427]] in Gezer; [[H1507]] so the Canaanites [[H3669]] continued to dwell [[H3427]] among them [[H7130]] in Gezer. [[H1507]]

### 30
Zebulun [[H2074]] failed [[H3808]] to drive out [[H3423]] the inhabitants [[H3427]] of Kitron [[H7003]] [and] [[H853]] Nahalol; [[H5096]] so the Canaanites [[H3669]] lived [[H3427]] among them [[H7130]] and served [[H1961]] as forced laborers. [[H4522]]

### 31
Asher [[H836]] failed [[H3808]] to drive out [[H3423]] the inhabitants [[H3427]] of Acco, [[H5910]] Sidon, [[H6721]] Ahlab, [[H303]] Achzib, [[H392]] Helbah, [[H2462]] Aphik, [[H663]] and [[H853]] Rehob. [[H7340]]

### 32
So the Asherites [[H843]] lived [[H3427]] among [[H7130]] the Canaanite [[H3669]] inhabitants [[H3427]] of the land, [[H776]] because [[H3588]] they did not [[H3808]] drive them out. [[H3423]]

### 33
Naphtali [[H5321]] failed [[H3808]] to drive out [[H3423]] the inhabitants [[H3427]] of Beth-shemesh [[H1053]] and [[H853]] Beth-anath. [[H1043]] So [the Naphtalites] also lived [[H3427]] among [[H7130]] the Canaanite [[H3669]] inhabitants [[H3427]] of the land, [[H776]] but the inhabitants [[H3427]] of Beth-shemesh [[H1053]] and Beth-anath [[H1043]] served [[H1961]] them  as forced laborers. [[H4522]]

### 34
The Amorites [[H567]] forced [[H3905]] the Danites [[H1121]] into the hill country [[H2022]] and [[H3588]] did not [[H3808]] allow [[H5414]] them to come down [[H3381]] into the plain. [[H6010]]

### 35
And the Amorites [[H567]] were determined [[H2974]] to dwell [[H3427]] in Mount [[H2022]] Heres, [[H2776]] Aijalon, [[H357]] and Shaalbim. [[H8169]] But when the house [[H1004]] of Joseph [[H3130]] grew [[H3513]] in strength, [[H3027]] they pressed the Amorites [[H1961]] into forced labor. [[H4522]]

### 36
And the border [[H1366]] of the Amorites [[H567]] [extended] from the Ascent  of Akrabbim [[H4610]] to Sela [[H5553]] and beyond. [[H4605]]
