### 1
Now the Angel [[H4397]] of the LORD [[H3068]] went up [[H5927]] from [[H4480]] Gilgal [[H1537]] to [[H413]] Bochim [[H1066]] and said, [[H559]] “I brought you up [[H5927]] out of Egypt [[H4714]] and led [[H935]] you into [[H413]] the land [[H776]] I had promised [[H7650]] to your fathers, [[H1]] and I said, [[H559]] ‘I will never [[H3808]] break [[H6565]] My covenant [[H1285]] with you, [[H854]]

### 2
and you [[H859]] are not [[H3808]] to make [[H3772]] a covenant [[H1285]] with the people [[H3427]] of this [[H2063]] land, [[H776]] but you shall tear down [[H5422]] their altars.’ [[H4196]] Yet you have not [[H3808]] obeyed Me. [[H8085]] What [[H4100]] is this [[H2063]] you have done? [[H6213]]

### 3
So now [[H1571]] I tell you [[H559]] that I will not [[H3808]] drive out [these people] [[H1644]] before you; [[H6440]] they will be [thorns] [[H1961]] in your  sides, [[H6654]] and their gods [[H430]] will be [[H1961]] a snare [[H4170]] to you.” 

### 4
When the Angel [[H4397]] of the LORD [[H3068]] had spoken [[H1696]] these [[H428]] words [[H1697]] to [[H413]] all [[H3605]] the Israelites, [[H1121]] the people [[H5971]] lifted up [[H5375]] their voices [[H6963]] and wept. [[H1058]]

### 5
So they called [[H7121]] that [[H1931]] place [[H4725]] Bochim [[H1066]] and offered sacrifices [[H2076]] there [[H8033]] to the LORD. [[H3068]]

### 6
After Joshua [[H3091]] had dismissed [[H7971]] the people, [[H5971]] the Israelites [[H1121]] went out [[H1980]] to take possession of [[H3423]] the land, [[H776]] each [[H376]] to his own inheritance. [[H5159]]

### 7
And the people [[H5971]] served [[H5647]] the LORD [[H3068]] all [[H3605]] the days [[H3117]] of Joshua [[H3091]] [and] [[H3605]] of the elders [[H2205]] who [[H834]] outlived [[H748]] [him] [[H3091]] [and] [[H834]] had seen [[H7200]] all [[H3605]] the great [[H1419]] works [[H4639]] the LORD [[H3068]] had done [[H6213]] for Israel. [[H3478]]

### 8
And Joshua [[H3091]] son [[H1121]] of Nun, [[H5126]] the servant [[H5650]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] died [[H4191]] at the age [[H1121]] of 110. [[H3967]]

### 9
They buried [[H6912]] him in the land [[H1366]] of his inheritance, [[H5159]] at Timnath-heres [[H8556]] in the hill country [[H2022]] of Ephraim, [[H669]] north [[H6828]] of Mount [[H2022]] Gaash. [[H1608]]

### 10
After [[H310]] that [[H1931]] whole [[H3605]] generation [[H1755]] had also [[H1571]] been gathered [[H622]] to [[H413]] their fathers, [[H1]] another [[H312]] generation [[H1755]] rose up, [[H6965]] who [[H834]] did not [[H3808]] know [[H3045]] the LORD [[H3068]] or [[H1571]] the works [[H4639]] He had done [[H6213]] for Israel. [[H3478]]

### 11
And the Israelites [[H1121]] did [[H6213]] evil [[H7451]] in the sight [[H5869]] of the LORD [[H3068]] and served [[H5647]] the Baals. [[H1168]]

### 12
Thus they forsook [[H5800]] the LORD, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of their fathers, [[H1]] who had brought them [[H3318]] out of the land [[H776]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] and they followed [[H1980]] after [[H310]] various [[H312]] gods [[H430]] of the people [[H5971]] all around them. [[H5439]] They bowed down [[H7812]] to them  and provoked [[H3707]] the LORD {to anger}, [[H3068]]

### 13
for they forsook [[H5800]] Him [[H3068]] and served [[H5647]] Baal [[H1168]] and the Ashtoreths. [[H6252]]

### 14
Then the anger [[H639]] of the LORD [[H3068]] burned [[H2734]] against Israel, [[H3478]] and He handed them over to [[H5414]] raiders [[H8154]] who plundered [[H8155]] them. [[H853]] He sold them [[H4376]] into the hands [[H3027]] of their enemies [[H341]] all around, [[H5439]] whom they were [[H3201]] no [[H3808]] longer [[H5750]] able to resist. [[H5975]]

### 15
Wherever [[H3605]] [Israel] marched out, [[H3318]] the hand [[H3027]] of the LORD [[H3068]] was [[H1961]] against them  to bring calamity, [[H7451]] just as [[H834]] He [[H3068]] had sworn [[H7650]] to them.  So they were greatly distressed. [[H3334]]

### 16
Then the LORD [[H3068]] raised up [[H6965]] judges, [[H8199]] who delivered them [[H3467]] from the hands [[H3027]] of these raiders. [[H8154]]

### 17
[Israel,] however, [[H1571]] did not [[H3808]] listen [[H8085]] to [[H413]] their judges. [[H8199]] Instead, [[H3588]] they prostituted [[H2181]] themselves with [[H310]] other [[H312]] gods [[H430]] and bowed down [[H7812]] to them.  They quickly [[H4118]] turned [[H5493]] from [[H4480]] the way [[H1870]] of their fathers, [[H1]] who had walked [[H1980]] in obedience [[H8085]] to the LORD’s [[H3068]] commandments; [[H4687]] they did not [[H3808]] do as their fathers [had done]. [[H6213]]

### 18
Whenever [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] raised up [[H6965]] a judge [[H8199]] for the Israelites,  [He] [[H3068]] was [[H1961]] with [[H5973]] that judge [[H8199]] and delivered them [[H3467]] from the hands [[H3027]] of their enemies [[H341]] while the judge [[H8199]] was still alive; [[H3605]] for the LORD [[H3068]] was moved to pity [[H5162]] by their groaning [[H5009]] under those [[H6440]] who oppressed [[H3905]] and afflicted them. [[H1766]]

### 19
But when [[H1961]] the judge [[H8199]] died, [[H4191]] the Israelites became even more corrupt [[H7843]] than their fathers, [[H1]] going [[H1980]] after [[H310]] other [[H312]] gods [[H430]] to serve them [[H5647]] and bow down [[H7812]] to them.  They would not [[H3808]] turn [[H5307]] from their evil practices [[H4611]] and stubborn [[H7186]] ways. [[H1870]]

### 20
So the anger [[H639]] of the LORD [[H3068]] burned [[H2734]] against Israel, [[H3478]] and He said, [[H559]] “Because [[H3282]] this [[H2088]] nation [[H1471]] has transgressed [[H5674]] the covenant [[H1285]] I laid down [[H6680]] for their fathers [[H1]] and has not [[H3808]] heeded [[H8085]] My voice, [[H6963]]

### 21
I [[H589]] will no [[H3808]] longer [[H3254]] drive out [[H3423]] before them [[H4480]] any [[H376]] of the nations [[H1471]] Joshua [[H3091]] left [[H5800]] when he died. [[H4191]]

### 22
In this way [[H4616]] I will test [[H5254]] whether [[H518]] Israel [[H3478]] will keep [[H8104]] the way [[H1870]] of the LORD [[H3068]] by walking in it [[H1980]] as [[H834]] their fathers did.” [[H1]]

### 23
That is why the LORD [[H3068]] had left those [[H428]] nations [[H1471]] in place [[H3240]] and had not [[H1115]] driven them out [[H3423]] immediately [[H4118]] by delivering them [[H5414]] into the hand [[H3027]] of Joshua. [[H3091]]
