### 1
Now there was [[H1961]] a man [[H376]] from the hill country [[H2022]] of Ephraim [[H669]] named [[H8034]] Micah. [[H4319]]

### 2
He said [[H559]] to his mother, [[H517]] “The eleven [[H505]] hundred [shekels] [[H3967]] of silver [[H3701]] that [[H834]] were taken [[H3947]] from  you  and [[H1571]] about which I heard [[H241]] you [[H859]] utter a curse— [[H422]] I have [[H2009]] the silver {here} [[H3701]] with me; [[H854]] I [[H589]] took it.” [[H3947]] Then his mother [[H517]] said, [[H559]] “Blessed be [[H1288]] my son [[H1121]] by the LORD!” [[H3068]]

### 3
And when he had [[H7725]] returned [[H853]] the eleven [[H505]] hundred [[H3967]] [shekels] of silver [[H3701]] to his mother, [[H517]] [she] [[H517]] said, [[H559]] “I wholly [[H6942]] dedicate [[H6942]] the silver [[H3701]] to the LORD [[H3068]] for my son’s [[H1121]] benefit to make [[H6213]] a graven image [[H6459]] and a molten idol. [[H4541]] Therefore I will now [[H6258]] return it [[H7725]] to you.” 

### 4
So he returned [[H7725]] the silver [[H3701]] to his mother, [[H517]] and she [[H517]] took [[H3947]] two hundred [shekels] [[H3967]] of silver [[H3701]] and gave [[H5414]] them to a silversmith, [[H6884]] who made them [[H6213]] into a graven image [[H6459]] and a molten idol. [[H4541]] And they were placed [[H1961]] in the house [[H1004]] of Micah. [[H4319]]

### 5
Now this man [[H376]] Micah [[H4318]] had a shrine, [[H1004]] and he made [[H6213]] an ephod [[H646]] and some household idols, [[H8655]] and installed [[H4390]] one [[H259]] of his sons [[H1121]] to be [[H1961]] his priest. [[H3548]]

### 6
In those [[H1992]] days [[H3117]] there was no [[H369]] king [[H4428]] in Israel; [[H3478]] everyone [[H376]] did [what was] [[H6213]] right [[H3477]] in his own eyes. [[H5869]]

### 7
And there was [[H1961]] a young [[H5288]] Levite [[H3881]] from Bethlehem [[H1035]] in Judah, [[H3063]] who [[H1931]] had been residing [[H1481]] within the clan [[H4940]] of Judah. [[H3063]]

### 8
This man [[H376]] left [[H1980]] the city [[H5892]] of  Bethlehem [[H1035]] in Judah [[H3063]] to settle [[H1481]] where [[H834]] he could find [a place]. [[H4672]] And as he traveled, [[H6213]] he came [[H935]] to [[H5704]] Micah’s [[H4318]] house [[H1004]] in the hill country [[H2022]] of Ephraim. [[H669]]

### 9
“Where [[H370]] are you from?” [[H935]] Micah [[H4318]] asked [[H559]] him.  “I [[H595]] am a Levite [[H3881]] from Bethlehem [[H1035]] in Judah,” [[H3063]] he replied, [[H559]] “and I [[H595]] am on my way [[H1980]] to settle [[H1481]] wherever [[H834]] I can find a place.” [[H4672]]

### 10
“Stay [[H3427]] with me,” [[H5978]] Micah [[H4318]] said [[H559]] to him,  “and be [[H1961]] my father [[H1]] and priest, [[H3548]] and I [[H595]] will give [[H5414]] you  ten [shekels] [[H6235]] of silver [[H3701]] per year, [[H3117]] a suit [[H6187]] of clothes, [[H899]] and your provisions.” [[H4241]] So the Levite [[H3881]] went in [[H1980]]

### 11
and agreed [[H2974]] to stay [[H3427]] with [[H854]] [him], [[H376]] and the young man [[H5288]] became [[H1961]] like a [[H259]] son [[H1121]] to Micah. 

### 12
Micah [[H4318]] ordained [[H4390]] the Levite, [[H3881]] and the young man [[H5288]] became [[H1961]] his priest [[H3548]] and lived [[H1961]] in [his] [[H4318]] house. [[H1004]]

### 13
Then Micah [[H4318]] said, [[H559]] “Now [[H6258]] I know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] will be good [[H3190]] to me,  because [[H3588]] a Levite [[H3881]] has become [[H1961]] my priest.” [[H3548]]
