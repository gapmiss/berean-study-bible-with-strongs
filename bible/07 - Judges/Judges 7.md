###### 1
Early in the morning [[H7925]] Jerubbaal [[H3378]] (that is, [[H1931]] Gideon) [[H1439]] and all [[H3605]] the men [[H5971]] with him [[H854]] camped [[H2583]] beside [[H5921]] the spring of Harod. [[H5878]] And the camp [[H4264]] of Midian [[H4080]] was [[H1961]] north [[H6828]] of them  in the valley [[H6010]] near the hill [[H1389]] of Moreh. [[H4176]]

###### 2
The LORD [[H3068]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Gideon, [[H1439]] “You have [[H854]] too many [[H7227]] people [[H5971]] for Me to deliver [[H5414]] Midian [[H4080]] into their hands, [[H3027]] lest [[H6435]] Israel [[H3478]] glorify themselves [[H6286]] over Me, [[H5921]] saying, [[H559]] ‘My own hand [[H3027]] has delivered [[H3467]] me.’ 

###### 3
Now, therefore, [[H6258]] proclaim [[H7121]] in the hearing [[H241]] of the people: [[H5971]] ‘Whoever [[H4310]] is fearful [[H3373]] and trembling [[H2730]] may turn back [[H7725]] and leave [[H6852]] Mount [[H2022]] Gilead.’” [[H1568]] So twenty-two [[H6242]] thousand [[H505]] [of them] [[H5971]] turned back, [[H7725]] but ten [[H6235]] thousand [[H505]] remained. [[H7604]]

###### 4
Then [[H1931]] the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Gideon, [[H1439]] “There are still [[H5750]] too many [[H7227]] people. [[H5971]] Take them down [[H3381]] to [[H413]] the water, [[H4325]] and I will sift them [[H6884]] for you  there. [[H8033]] If [[H834]] I say [[H559]] to you, [[H413]] ‘This [one] [[H2088]] shall go [[H1980]] with you,’ [[H854]] he shall go. [[H1980]] But if [[H834]] I say, [[H559]] ‘This [one] [[H2088]] shall not [[H3808]] go [[H1980]] with you,’ [[H5973]] he [[H1931]] shall not [[H3808]] go. [[H1980]]

###### 5
So [Gideon] brought the people [[H5971]] down [[H3381]] to [[H413]] the water, [[H4325]] and the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] [him], [[H1439]] “Separate [[H3322]] those [[H3605]] who [[H834]] lap [[H3952]] the water [[H4325]] with their tongues [[H3956]] like [[H834]] a dog [[H3611]] from those [[H3605]] who [[H834]] kneel [[H3766]] to drink.” [[H8354]]

###### 6
And the number [[H4557]] of those who lapped [the water] [[H3952]] with their hands [[H3027]] to [[H413]] their mouths [[H6310]] was [[H1961]] three [[H7969]] hundred [[H3967]] men; [[H376]] all [[H3605]] the others [[H3499]] knelt [[H3766]] to drink. [[H8354]]

###### 7
Then the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Gideon, [[H1439]] “With the three [[H7969]] hundred [[H3967]] men [[H376]] who lapped [the water] [[H3952]] I will save [[H3467]] you [[H853]] and deliver [[H5414]] the Midianites [[H4080]] into your hands. [[H3027]] But all the others [[H3605]] are to go [[H1980]] home.” [[H4725]]

###### 8
So Gideon sent [[H7971]] the rest of [[H3605]] the Israelites [[H376]] to their tents [[H168]] but kept [[H2388]] the three [[H7969]] hundred [[H3967]] men, [[H376]] who took [[H3947]] charge of [[H3027]] the provisions [[H6720]] and trumpets [[H7782]] of the others. [[H5971]] And [[H853]] the camp [[H4264]] of Midian [[H4080]] lay [[H1961]] below [[H8478]] him  in the valley. [[H6010]]

###### 9
That [[H1931]] night [[H3915]] the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H559]] to [Gideon], [[H413]] “Get up [[H6965]] [and] go down [[H3381]] against the camp, [[H4264]] for [[H3588]] I have given [[H5414]] it into your hands. [[H3027]]

###### 10
But if [[H518]] you [[H859]] are afraid [[H3373]] to [do so], [[H3381]] then go down [[H3381]] to [[H413]] the camp [[H4264]] with your servant [[H5288]] Purah [[H6513]]

###### 11
and listen [[H8085]] to what [[H4100]] they are saying. [[H1696]] Then [[H310]] your hands [[H3027]] will be strengthened [[H2388]] to attack [[H3381]] the camp.” [[H4264]] So he [[H1931]] went [[H3381]] with Purah [[H6513]] his servant [[H5288]] to [[H413]] the outposts [[H7097]] where armed men [[H2571]] were [guarding] [[H834]] the camp. [[H4264]]

###### 12
Now the Midianites, [[H4080]] Amalekites, [[H6002]] and all [[H3605]] the other people [[H1121]] of the East [[H6924]] had settled [[H5307]] in the valley [[H6010]] like a swarm of [[H7230]] locusts, [[H697]] and their camels [[H1581]] were as innumerable [[H369]] as the sand [[H2344]] on [[H5921]] the seashore. [[H8193]]

###### 13
And as Gideon [[H1439]] arrived, [[H935]] a man [[H376]] was telling [[H5608]] his friend [[H7453]] about a dream. [[H2472]] “Behold, [[H2009]] I had a dream,” [[H2472]] he said, [[H559]] “and I saw [[H2009]] a loaf [[H6742]] of barley [[H8184]] bread [[H3899]] come [[H935]] tumbling [[H2015]] into the Midianite [[H4080]] camp. [[H4264]] It struck [[H5221]] the tent [[H168]] so hard that [[H5307]] the tent [[H168]] overturned [[H2015]] and collapsed.” [[H5307]]

###### 14
His friend [[H7453]] replied: [[H6030]] “This [[H2063]] is nothing [[H369]] less than [[H1115]] the sword [[H2719]] of Gideon [[H1439]] son [[H1121]] of Joash, [[H3101]] the Israelite. [[H376]] God [[H430]] has delivered [[H5414]] Midian [[H4080]] and [[H853]] the whole [[H3605]] camp [[H4264]] into his hands.” [[H3027]]

###### 15
When Gideon [[H1439]] heard [[H8085]] the dream [[H2472]] and its interpretation, [[H7667]] he bowed in worship. [[H7812]] He returned [[H7725]] to [[H413]] the camp [[H4264]] of Israel [[H3478]] and said, [[H559]] “Get up, [[H6965]] for [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] has delivered [[H5414]] the camp [[H4264]] of Midian [[H4080]] into your hands.” [[H3027]]

###### 16
And he divided [[H2673]] the three [[H7969]] hundred [[H3967]] men [[H376]] into three [[H7969]] companies [[H7218]] and gave [[H5414]] each man [[H3605]] a trumpet [[H7782]] in one hand [[H3027]] and a large jar [in the other], [[H3537]] containing [[H8432]] a torch. [[H3940]]

###### 17
“Watch me [[H7200]] and do [[H6213]] as I do,” [[H3651]] [Gideon] said. [[H559]] “When I [[H595]] come [[H935]] to the outskirts [[H7097]] of the camp, [[H4264]] do [[H6213]] exactly as [[H834]] I do. [[H6213]]

###### 18
When I [[H595]] and all [[H3605]] who [are] [[H834]] with me [[H854]] blow [[H8628]] our trumpets, [[H7782]] then you [[H859]] are also [[H1571]] to blow [[H8628]] your trumpets [[H7782]] from all [[H3605]] around [[H5439]] the camp [[H4264]] and shout, [[H559]] ‘For the LORD [[H3068]] and for Gideon!’” [[H1439]]

###### 19
Gideon [[H1439]] and the hundred [[H3967]] men [[H376]] with him [[H854]] reached [[H935]] the outskirts [[H7097]] of the camp [[H4264]] at the beginning [[H7218]] of the middle [[H8484]] watch, [[H821]] just after [[H389]] the changing [[H6965]] of the guard. [[H8104]] They blew [[H8628]] their trumpets [[H7782]] and broke [[H5310]] the jars [[H3537]] that [were] [[H834]] in their hands. [[H3027]]

###### 20
The three [[H7969]] companies [[H7218]] blew [[H8628]] their trumpets [[H7782]] and shattered [[H7665]] their jars. [[H3537]] Holding [[H2388]] the torches [[H3940]] in their left [[H8040]] hands [[H3027]] and the trumpets [[H7782]] in their right [[H3225]] hands, [[H3027]] they shouted, [[H7121]] “A sword [[H2719]] for the LORD [[H3068]] and for Gideon!” [[H1439]]

###### 21
Each [Israelite] [[H376]] took [[H5975]] his position [[H8478]] around [[H5439]] the camp, [[H4264]] and the entire [[H3605]] Midianite army [[H4264]] fled, [[H7323]] crying out [[H7321]] as they ran. [[H5127]]

###### 22
And when the three [[H7969]] hundred [[H3967]] trumpets [[H7782]] sounded, [[H8628]] the LORD [[H3068]] set [[H7760]] the swords [[H2719]] of every man [[H376]] in the camp [[H4264]] against each other. [[H7453]] The army [[H4264]] fled [[H5127]] to [[H5704]] Beth-shittah [[H1029]] toward Zererah [[H6888]] as [[H5704]] far as the border [[H8193]] of Abel-meholah [[H65]] near [[H5921]] Tabbath. [[H2888]]

###### 23
Then the men [[H376]] of Israel [[H3478]] were called out [[H6817]] from [[H4480]] Naphtali, [[H5321]] Asher, [[H836]] and [[H4480]] all [[H3605]] Manasseh, [[H4519]] and they pursued [[H7291]] the Midianites. [[H4080]]

###### 24
Gideon [[H1439]] sent [[H7971]] messengers [[H4397]] throughout [[H3605]] the hill country [[H2022]] of Ephraim [[H669]] to say, [[H559]] “Come down [[H3381]] against [[H7125]] the Midianites [[H4080]] and seize [[H3920]] the waters [[H4325]] of the Jordan [[H3383]] ahead of them  as far as [[H5704]] Beth-barah.” [[H1012]] So all [[H3605]] the men [[H376]] of Ephraim [[H669]] were called out, [[H6817]] and they captured [[H3920]] the waters [[H4325]] of the Jordan [[H3383]] as [[H5704]] far as Beth-barah. [[H1012]]

###### 25
They also captured [[H3920]] Oreb [[H6159]] and Zeeb, [[H2062]] the two [[H8147]] princes [[H8269]] of Midian; [[H4080]] and they killed [[H2026]] Oreb [[H6159]] at the rock [[H6697]] of Oreb [[H6159]] and Zeeb [[H2062]] at the winepress of Zeeb. [[H2062]] So they pursued [[H7291]] the Midianites [[H4080]] [and] brought [[H935]] the heads [[H7218]] of Oreb [[H6159]] and Zeeb [[H2062]] to [[H413]] Gideon [[H1439]] on the other side [[H5676]] of the Jordan.
