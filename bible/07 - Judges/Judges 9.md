### 1
Now Abimelech [[H40]] son [[H1121]] of Jerubbaal [[H3378]] went [[H1980]] to [[H413]] his mother’s [[H517]] brothers [[H251]] at Shechem [[H7927]] and said [[H1696]] to [[H413]] them [[H413]] and all [[H3605]] the clan [[H4940]] of his mother, [[H517]]

### 2
“Please [[H4994]] ask [[H1696]] all [[H3605]] the leaders [[H1167]] of Shechem, [[H7927]] ‘Is it better [[H2896]] for you  that seventy [[H7657]] men, [[H376]] all [[H3605]] the sons [[H1121]] of Jerubbaal, [[H3378]] rule [[H4910]] over you,  or [[H518]] just one [[H259]] man?’ [[H376]] Remember [[H2142]] that [[H3588]] I [[H589]] am your own flesh [[H1320]] and blood. [[H6106]]

### 3
And when his mother’s [[H517]] brothers [[H251]] spoke [[H1696]] all [[H3605]] these [[H428]] words [[H1697]] about [[H5921]] him in the presence [[H241]] of all [[H3605]] the leaders [[H1167]] of Shechem, [[H7927]] their hearts [[H3820]] were inclined [[H5186]] to follow [[H310]] Abimelech, [[H40]] for [[H3588]] they said, [[H559]] “He [[H1931]] is our brother.” [[H251]]

### 4
So they gave [[H5414]] him  seventy [shekels] [[H7657]] of silver [[H3701]] from the temple [[H1004]] of  Baal-berith, [[H1170]] with which  Abimelech [[H40]] hired [[H7936]] some worthless [[H7386]] and reckless [[H6348]] men [[H582]] to follow [[H1980]] him. [[H310]]

### 5
He went [[H935]] to his father’s [[H1]] house [[H1004]] in Ophrah, [[H6084]] and on [[H5921]] one [[H259]] stone [[H68]] murdered [[H2026]] his seventy [[H7657]] brothers, [[H251]] the sons [[H1121]] of Jerubbaal. [[H3378]] But Jotham, [[H3147]] the youngest [[H6996]] son [[H1121]] of Jerubbaal, [[H3378]] survived, [[H3498]] because [[H3588]] he hid himself. [[H2244]]

### 6
Then all [[H3605]] the leaders [[H1167]] of Shechem [[H7927]] and [[H3605]] Beth-millo [[H4407]] gathered [[H622]] beside [[H5973]] the oak [[H436]] at the pillar [[H5324]] in Shechem [[H7927]] and proceeded [[H1980]] to make [[H4427]] Abimelech [[H40]] [their] king. [[H4428]]

### 7
When this was reported [[H5046]] to Jotham, [[H3147]] he climbed [[H1980]] to the top [[H7218]] of Mount [[H2022]] Gerizim, [[H1630]] raised [[H5375]] his voice, [[H6963]] and cried out: [[H7121]] “Listen [[H8085]] to me, [[H413]] O leaders [[H1167]] of Shechem, [[H7927]] and may God [[H430]] listen [[H8085]] to you. [[H413]]

### 8
One day the trees [[H6086]] set out [[H1980]] to anoint [[H4886]] a king [[H4428]] for themselves. [[H5921]] They said [[H559]] to the olive tree, [[H2132]] ‘Reign [[H4427]] over us.’ [[H5921]]

### 9
But the olive tree [[H2132]] replied, [[H559]] ‘Should I stop giving [[H2308]] my oil [[H1880]] that [[H834]] honors [[H3513]] both God [[H430]] and man, [[H376]] to hold [[H1980]] sway [[H5128]] over [[H5921]] the trees?’ [[H6086]]

### 10
Then the trees [[H6086]] said [[H559]] to the fig tree, [[H8384]] ‘Come [[H1980]] and reign [[H4427]] over us.’ [[H5921]]

### 11
But the fig tree [[H8384]] replied, [[H559]] ‘Should I stop giving [[H2308]] my sweetness [[H4987]] and my good [[H2896]] fruit, [[H8570]] to hold [[H1980]] sway [[H5128]] over [[H5921]] the trees?’ [[H6086]]

### 12
Then the trees [[H6086]] said [[H559]] to the grapevine, [[H1612]] ‘Come [[H1980]] and reign [[H4427]] over us.’ [[H5921]]

### 13
But the grapevine [[H1612]] replied, [[H559]] ‘Should I stop giving [[H2308]] my wine [[H8492]] that cheers [[H8055]] [both] God [[H430]] and man, [[H376]] to hold [[H1980]] sway [[H5128]] over [[H5921]] the trees?’ [[H6086]]

### 14
Finally all [[H3605]] the trees [[H6086]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] the thornbush, [[H329]] ‘Come [[H1980]] and reign [[H4427]] over us.’ [[H5921]]

### 15
But the thornbush [[H329]] replied, [[H559]] ‘If [[H518]] you [[H859]] really [[H571]] are anointing me [[H4886]] as king [[H4428]] over you, [[H5921]] come [[H935]] and find refuge [[H2620]] in my shade. [[H6738]] But if [[H518]] not, [[H369]] may fire [[H784]] come out [[H3318]] of [[H4480]] the thornbush [[H329]] and consume [[H398]] the cedars [[H730]] of Lebanon.” [[H3844]]

### 16
Now [[H6258]] if [[H518]] you have acted [[H6213]] faithfully [[H571]] and honestly [[H8549]] in making Abimelech [[H40]] king, [[H4427]] if [[H518]] you have done well [[H6213]] by [[H5973]] Jerubbaal [[H3378]] and his family, [[H1004]] and if [[H518]] you have done [[H6213]] to him  as he [[H3027]] deserves— [[H1576]]

### 17
for [[H834]] my father [[H1]] fought [[H3898]] for you [[H5921]] and risked [[H7993]] his life [[H5315]] to deliver [[H5337]] you [[H853]] from the hand [[H3027]] of Midian, [[H4080]]

### 18
but you [[H859]] have risen up [[H6965]] against [[H5921]] my father's [[H1]] house [[H1004]] this day [[H3117]] and killed [[H2026]] his seventy [[H7657]] sons [[H1121]] on [[H5921]] a single [[H259]] stone, [[H68]] and you have made Abimelech, [[H40]] the son [[H1121]] of his maidservant, [[H519]] king [[H4427]] over [[H5921]] the leaders [[H1167]] of Shechem [[H7927]] because [[H3588]] he [[H1931]] is your brother [[H251]]

### 19
if [[H518]] you have acted [[H6213]] faithfully [[H571]] and honestly [[H8549]] toward [[H5973]] Jerubbaal [[H3378]] and his house [[H1004]] this [[H2088]] day, [[H3117]] [then] may you rejoice [[H8055]] in Abimelech, [[H40]] and [[H1571]] he [[H1931]] in you. 

### 20
But if [[H518]] not, [[H369]] may fire [[H784]] come [[H3318]] from Abimelech [[H40]] and consume [[H398]] the leaders [[H1167]] of Shechem [[H7927]] and [[H853]] Beth-millo, [[H4407]] and may fire [[H784]] come [[H3318]] from the leaders [[H1167]] of Shechem [[H7927]] and [[H1004]] Beth-millo [[H4407]] and consume [[H398]] Abimelech.” [[H40]]

### 21
Then Jotham [[H3147]] ran away, [[H5127]] escaping [[H1272]] to Beer, [[H876]] and he lived [[H3427]] there [[H8033]] for fear [[H6440]] of his brother [[H251]] Abimelech. [[H40]]

### 22
After Abimelech [[H40]] had reigned [[H7786]] over [[H5921]] Israel [[H3478]] for three [[H7969]] years, [[H8141]]

### 23
God [[H430]] sent [[H7971]] an evil [[H7451]] spirit [[H7307]] between [[H996]] Abimelech [[H40]] and [[H996]] the leaders [[H1167]] of Shechem [[H7927]] and caused them [[H1167]] to treat Abimelech [[H40]] deceitfully, [[H898]]

### 24
in order that the crime [[H2555]] against the seventy [[H7657]] sons [[H1121]] of Jerubbaal [[H3378]] might come to justice [[H935]] and their blood [[H1818]] be avenged [[H7760]] on [[H5921]] their brother [[H251]] Abimelech [[H40]] and on [[H5921]] the leaders [[H1167]] of Shechem, [[H7927]] who [[H834]] had helped [[H2388]] him [[H3027]] murder [[H2026]] his brothers. [[H251]]

### 25
The leaders [[H1167]] of Shechem [[H7927]] set [[H7760]] an ambush [[H693]] against [Abimelech]  on [[H5921]] the hilltops, [[H7218]] and they robbed [[H1497]] all [[H3605]] who [[H834]] passed [[H5674]] by them [[H5921]] on the road. [[H1870]] So this was reported [[H5046]] to Abimelech. [[H40]]

### 26
Meanwhile, Gaal [[H1603]] son [[H1121]] of Ebed [[H5651]] came [[H935]] with his brothers [[H251]] and crossed [[H5674]] into Shechem, [[H7927]] and the leaders [[H1167]] of Shechem [[H7927]] put their confidence [[H982]] in him. 

### 27
And after they had gone out [[H3318]] into the fields, [[H7704]] gathered [grapes] [[H1219]] from their vineyards, [[H3754]] and trodden [them], [[H1869]] they held [[H6213]] a festival [[H1974]] and went [[H935]] into the house [[H1004]] of their god; [[H430]] and as they ate [[H398]] and drank, [[H8354]] they cursed [[H7043]] Abimelech. [[H40]]

### 28
Then Gaal [[H1603]] son [[H1121]] of Ebed [[H5651]] said, [[H559]] “Who [[H4310]] is Abimelech, [[H40]] and who [[H4310]] is Shechem, [[H7927]] that [[H3588]] we should serve him? [[H5647]] Is he not [[H3808]] the son [[H1121]] of Jerubbaal, [[H3378]] and is not Zebul [[H2083]] his officer? [[H6496]] You are to serve [[H5647]] the men [[H376]] of Hamor, [[H2544]] the father [[H1]] of Shechem. [[H7927]] Why [[H4069]] should we [[H587]] serve Abimelech? [[H5647]]

### 29
If only [[H4310]] this [[H2088]] people [[H5971]] were under my authority, [[H3027]] I would remove [[H5493]] Abimelech; [[H40]] I would say [[H559]] to [him], [[H40]] ‘Muster [[H7235]] your army [[H6635]] and come out!’” [[H3318]]

### 30
When Zebul [[H2083]] the governor [[H8269]] of the city [[H5892]] heard [[H8085]] the words [[H1697]] of Gaal [[H1603]] son [[H1121]] of Ebed, [[H5651]] he burned [[H2734]] with anger. [[H639]]

### 31
So he covertly sent [[H7971]] messengers [[H4397]] to [[H413]] Abimelech [[H40]] to say, [[H559]] “Look, [[H2009]] Gaal [[H1603]] son [[H1121]] of Ebed [[H5651]] and his brothers [[H251]] have come [[H935]] to Shechem [[H7927]] and are stirring up [[H6696]] the city [[H5892]] against you. [[H5921]]

### 32
Now then, [[H6258]] tonight [[H3915]] you [[H859]] and the people [[H5971]] with you [[H854]] are to come [[H6965]] and lie in wait [[H693]] in the fields. [[H7704]]

### 33
And [[H1961]] in the morning [[H1242]] at sunrise, [[H2224]] get up [[H7925]] and advance [[H6584]] against [[H5921]] the city. [[H5892]] When [Gaal] [[H1931]] and his men [[H5971]] come out [[H3318]] against you, [[H413]] do [[H6213]] to them  whatever [[H834]] you are able.” [[H4672]]

### 34
So Abimelech [[H40]] and all [[H3605]] his troops [[H5971]] set out [[H6965]] by night [[H3915]] and lay in wait [[H693]] against [[H5921]] Shechem [[H7927]] in four [[H702]] companies. [[H7218]]

### 35
Now Gaal [[H1603]] son [[H1121]] of Ebed [[H5651]] went out [[H3318]] and stood [[H5975]] at the entrance [[H6607]] of the city [[H5892]] gate [[H8179]] just as Abimelech [[H40]] and his men [[H5971]] came out [[H6965]] from [[H4480]] their hiding places. [[H3993]]

### 36
When Gaal [[H1603]] saw [[H7200]] the people, [[H5971]] he said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Zebul, [[H2083]] “Look, [[H2009]] people [[H5971]] are coming down [[H3381]] from the mountains!” [[H7218]] But Zebul [[H2083]] replied, [[H559]] “The shadows [[H6738]] of the mountains [[H2022]] look [[H7200]] like men [[H376]] to you.” [[H859]]

### 37
Then Gaal [[H1603]] spoke up [[H1696]] again, [[H3254]] “Look, [[H2009]] people [[H5971]] are coming down [[H3381]] from [[H5973]] the center [[H2872]] of the land, [[H776]] and one [[H259]] company [[H7218]] is coming [[H935]] by way of [[H1870]] the Diviners’ [[H6049]] Oak.” [[H436]]

### 38
“Where [[H346]] is your gloating [[H6310]] now?” [[H645]] Zebul [[H2083]] replied. [[H559]] “You said, [[H559]] ‘Who [[H4310]] is Abimelech [[H40]] that [[H3588]] we should serve him?’ [[H5647]] Are these not [[H3808]] the people [[H5971]] you ridiculed? [[H3988]] Go out [[H3318]] now [[H6258]] and fight them!” [[H3898]]

### 39
So Gaal [[H1603]] went out [[H3318]] before [[H6440]] the leaders [[H1167]] of Shechem [[H7927]] and fought [[H3898]] against Abimelech, [[H40]]

### 40
but Abimelech [[H40]] pursued him, [[H7291]] and Gaal fled [[H5127]] before him. [[H6440]] And many [Shechemites] [[H7227]] fell [[H5307]] wounded [[H2491]] all the way [[H5704]] to the entrance [[H6607]] of the gate. [[H8179]]

### 41
Abimelech [[H40]] stayed [[H3427]] in Arumah, [[H725]] and Zebul [[H2083]] drove [[H1644]] Gaal [[H1603]] and his brothers [[H251]] out of [[H3427]] Shechem. [[H7927]]

### 42
The next day [[H4283]] the people [of Shechem] [[H5971]] went out [[H3318]] into the fields, [[H7704]] and this was reported [[H5046]] to Abimelech. [[H40]]

### 43
So he took [[H3947]] his men, [[H5971]] divided [[H2673]] them into three [[H7969]] companies, [[H7218]] and waited in ambush [[H693]] in the fields. [[H7704]] When he saw [[H7200]] the people [[H5971]] coming out [[H3318]] of [[H4480]] the city, [[H5892]] he rose up [[H6965]] against them [[H5921]] and attacked them. [[H5221]]

### 44
Then Abimelech [[H40]] and the companies [[H7218]] with him [[H5973]] rushed forward [[H6584]] and took their stand [[H5975]] at the entrance [[H6607]] of the city [[H5892]] gate. [[H8179]] The other two [[H8147]] companies [[H7218]] rushed [[H6584]] against [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] who [were] [[H834]] in the fields [[H7704]] and struck them down. [[H5221]]

### 45
And all [[H3605]] that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] Abimelech [[H40]] fought [[H3898]] against the city [[H5892]] until he had captured it [[H3920]] and killed [[H2026]] its people. [[H5971]] Then he demolished [[H5422]] the city [[H5892]] and sowed [[H2232]] it with salt. [[H4417]]

### 46
On hearing of this, [[H8085]] all [[H3605]] the leaders [[H1167]] in the tower [[H4026]] of Shechem [[H7927]] entered [[H935]] the inner chamber [[H6877]] of the temple [[H1004]] of El-berith. [[H1286]]

### 47
And when it was reported [[H5046]] to Abimelech [[H40]] that [[H3588]] all [[H3605]] the leaders [[H1167]] in the tower [[H4026]] of Shechem [[H7927]] were gathered there, [[H6908]]

### 48
he [[H40]] and all [[H3605]] his men [[H5971]] went up [[H5927]] to Mount [[H2022]] Zalmon. [[H6756]] Abimelech [[H40]] took [[H3947]] his ax [[H7134]] in his hand [[H3027]] and cut [[H3772]] a branch [[H7754]] from the trees, [[H6086]] which he lifted [[H5375]] to [[H5921]] his shoulder, [[H7926]] saying [[H559]] to [[H413]] his men, [[H5971]] Hurry [[H4116]] and do [[H6213]] what [[H4100]] you have seen [[H7200]] me do. [[H6213]]

### 49
So each [[H3605]] man [[H376]] also [[H1571]] cut [[H3772]] his own branch [[H7754]] and followed [[H1980]] Abimelech. [[H40]] Then they piled [the branches] [[H7760]] against [[H5921]] the inner chamber [[H6877]] and set it [[H3341]] on fire [[H784]] above them, [[H5921]] killing [[H4191]] everyone [[H3605]] in the tower [[H4026]] of Shechem, [[H7927]] about a thousand [[H505]] men [[H376]] and women. [[H802]]

### 50
Then Abimelech [[H40]] went [[H1980]] to [[H413]] Thebez, [[H8405]] encamped [[H2583]] against it, [[H8405]] and captured it. [[H3920]]

### 51
But there was [[H1961]] a strong [[H5797]] tower [[H4026]] inside [[H8432]] the city, [[H5892]] and all [[H3605]] the men, [[H582]] women, [[H802]] and leaders [[H1167]] of the city [[H5892]] fled [[H5127]] there. [[H8033]] They locked themselves in [[H5462]] and went up [[H5927]] to [[H5921]] the roof [[H1406]] of the tower. [[H4026]]

### 52
When Abimelech [[H40]] came [[H935]] to [[H5704]] attack [[H3898]] the tower, [[H4026]] he approached [[H5066]] its [[H4026]] entrance [[H6607]] to set it on fire. [[H8313]]

### 53
But a [[H259]] woman [[H802]] dropped [[H7993]] an upper [[H6400]] millstone [[H7393]] on [[H5921]] Abimelech’s [[H40]] head, [[H7218]] crushing [[H7533]] his skull. [[H1538]]

### 54
He quickly [[H4120]] called [[H7121]] his armor-bearer, [[H5375]] saying, [[H559]] “Draw [[H8025]] your sword [[H2719]] and kill me, [[H4191]] lest [[H6435]] they say [[H559]] of me,  ‘A woman [[H802]] killed him.’” [[H2026]] So Abimelech’s armor-bearer ran [his sword] through him, [[H1856]] and he died. [[H4191]]

### 55
And when the Israelites [[H376]] saw [[H7200]] that [[H3588]] Abimelech [[H40]] was dead, [[H4191]] they all [[H376]] went [[H1980]] home. [[H4725]]

### 56
In this way God [[H430]] repaid [[H7725]] the wickedness [[H7451]] that [[H834]] Abimelech [[H40]] had done [[H6213]] to his father [[H1]] by murdering [[H2026]] his seventy [[H7657]] brothers. [[H251]]

### 57
And God [[H430]] also brought back [[H7725]] upon their own heads [[H7218]] all [[H3605]] the evil [[H7451]] of the men [[H376]] of Shechem. [[H7927]] So the curse [[H7045]] of Jotham [[H3147]] son [[H1121]] of Jerubbaal [[H3378]] came [[H935]] upon them. [[H413]]
