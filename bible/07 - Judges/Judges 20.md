### 1
Then all [[H3605]] the Israelites [[H1121]] from Dan [[H1835]] to [[H5704]] Beersheba [[H884]] and from the land [[H776]] of Gilead [[H1568]] came out, [[H3318]] and the congregation [[H5712]] assembled [[H6950]] as one [[H259]] man [[H376]] before [[H413]] the LORD [[H3068]] at Mizpah. [[H4709]]

### 2
The leaders [[H6438]] of all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] and all [[H3605]] the tribes [[H7626]] of Israel [[H3478]] presented themselves [[H3320]] in the assembly [[H6951]] of God’s [[H430]] people: [[H5971]] 400,000 [[H702]] men [[H376]] on foot, [[H7273]] armed [[H8025]] with swords. [[H2719]]

### 3
(Now the Benjamites [[H1121]] heard [[H8085]] that [[H3588]] the Israelites [[H1121]] had gone up [[H5927]] to Mizpah.) [[H4709]] And the Israelites [[H1121]] asked, [[H559]] “Tell [[H1696]] us, how [[H349]] did this [[H2063]] wicked thing [[H7451]] happen?” [[H1961]]

### 4
So the Levite, [[H3881]] the husband [[H376]] of the murdered [[H7523]] woman, [[H802]] answered: [[H6030]] “I [[H589]] and my concubine [[H6370]] came [[H935]] to Gibeah [[H1390]] in Benjamin [[H1144]] to spend the night. [[H3885]]

### 5
And during the night, [[H3915]] the men [[H1167]] of Gibeah [[H1390]] rose up [[H6965]] against me [[H5921]] and surrounded [[H5437]] the house. [[H1004]] They intended [[H1819]] to kill me, [[H2026]] but they raped [[H6031]] my concubine, [[H6370]] and she died. [[H4191]]

### 6
Then I took [[H270]] my concubine, [[H6370]] cut her into pieces, [[H5408]] and sent her [[H7971]] throughout [[H3605]] the land [[H7704]] of Israel's [[H3478]] inheritance, [[H5159]] because [[H3588]] they had committed [[H6213]] a lewd [[H2154]] and disgraceful act [[H5039]] in Israel. [[H3478]]

### 7
Behold, [[H2009]] all [[H3605]] you Israelites, [[H1121]] give [[H3051]] your  advice [[H1697]] and verdict [[H6098]] here and now.” [[H1988]]

### 8
Then all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] stood [[H6965]] as one [[H259]] man [[H376]] and said, [[H559]] “Not one [[H3808]] of us will return [[H1980]] to his tent [[H168]] [or] [[H5493]] to his house. [[H1004]]

### 9
Now [[H6258]] this [[H2088]] is what [[H834]] we will do [[H6213]] to Gibeah: [[H1390]] We will go against it [[H5921]] as the lot dictates. [[H1486]]

### 10
We will take [[H3947]] ten [[H6235]] men [[H376]] out of [every] hundred [[H3967]] from all [[H3605]] the tribes [[H7626]] of Israel, [[H3478]] and a hundred [[H3967]] out of [every] thousand, [[H505]] and a thousand [[H505]] out of [every] ten thousand, [[H7233]] to supply [[H3947]] provisions [[H6720]] for the army [[H5971]] when they go [[H935]] to Gibeah [[H1387]] in Benjamin [[H1144]] to punish [[H6213]] them for all [[H3605]] the vileness [[H5039]] they have committed [[H6213]] in Israel. [[H3478]]

### 11
So all [[H3605]] the men [[H376]] of Israel [[H3478]] gathered [[H622]] as one [[H259]] man, [[H376]] united [[H2270]] against [[H413]] the city. [[H5892]]

### 12
And the tribes [[H7626]] of Israel [[H3478]] sent [[H7971]] men [[H582]] throughout [[H3605]] the tribe [[H7626]] of Benjamin, [[H1144]] saying, [[H559]] “What [[H4100]] is this [[H2063]] wickedness [[H7451]] that [[H834]] has occurred [[H1961]] among you? 

### 13
Hand over [[H5414]] the wicked [[H1100]] men [[H376]] of Gibeah [[H1390]] so we can put them to death [[H4191]] and purge [[H1197]] Israel [[H3478]] of this wickedness.” [[H7451]] But the Benjamites [[H1121]] refused [[H14]] to heed [[H8085]] the voice [[H6963]] of their fellow [[H251]] Israelites. [[H1121]]

### 14
And from [[H4480]] their cities [[H5892]] [they] [[H1121]] came together [[H622]] at Gibeah [[H1390]] to go out [[H3318]] and fight [[H4421]] against [[H5973]] the Israelites. [[H1121]]

### 15
On that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] the Benjamites [[H1121]] mobilized [[H6485]] 26,000 [[H6242]] swordsmen [[H2719]] from their cities, [[H5892]] in addition to [[H905]] the 700 [[H7651]] select [[H970]] men [[H376]] of Gibeah. [[H1390]]

### 16
Among all [[H3605]] these [[H2088]] soldiers [[H5971]] there were 700 [[H7651]] select [[H970]] left-handers, [[H334]] each of whom [[H3605]] could sling [[H7049]] a stone [[H68]] at [[H413]] a hair [[H8185]] without [[H3808]] missing. [[H2398]]

### 17
The Israelites, [[H376]] apart from [[H905]] Benjamin, [[H1144]] mustered [[H6485]] 400,000 [[H702]] swordsmen, [[H8025]] each one [[H3605]] an experienced warrior. [[H376]]

### 18
The Israelites [[H1121]] set out, [[H6965]] went up [[H5927]] to Bethel, [[H1008]] and inquired [[H7592]] of God, [[H430]] “Who [[H4310]] of us  shall go up [[H5927]] first [[H8462]] to fight [[H4421]] against [[H5973]] the Benjamites?” [[H1121]] “Judah will be first,” [[H3063]] the LORD [[H3068]] replied. [[H559]]

### 19
The next morning [[H1242]] the Israelites [[H1121]] set out [[H6965]] and camped [[H2583]] near [[H5921]] Gibeah. [[H1390]]

### 20
And the men [[H376]] of Israel [[H3478]] went out [[H3318]] to fight [[H4421]] against [[H5973]] Benjamin [[H1144]] and took up their battle [[H4421]] positions [[H6186]] at Gibeah. [[H1390]]

### 21
Then the Benjamites [[H1121]] came out [[H3318]] of [[H4480]] Gibeah [[H1390]] and cut down [[H7843]] 22,000 [[H8147]] Israelites [[H3478]] on the battlefield [[H776]] that [[H1931]] day. [[H3117]]

### 22
But the Israelite [[H376]] army [[H5971]] took courage [[H2388]] and again [[H3254]] took their battle [[H4421]] positions [[H6186]] in the same place [[H4725]] where [[H834]] they had arrayed themselves [[H6186]] on the first [[H7223]] day. [[H3117]]

### 23
They [[H1121]] went up [[H5927]] and wept [[H1058]] before [[H6440]] the LORD [[H3068]] until [[H5704]] evening, [[H6153]] inquiring [[H7592]] of Him, [[H3068]] “Should we again [[H3254]] draw near [[H5066]] for battle [[H4421]] against [[H5973]] our brothers [[H251]] the Benjamites?” [[H1121]] And the LORD [[H3068]] answered, [[H559]] “Go up [[H5927]] against them.” [[H413]]

### 24
On the second [[H8145]] day [[H3117]] the Israelites [[H1121]] advanced [[H7126]] against [[H413]] the Benjamites. [[H1121]]

### 25
That same day [[H3117]] the Benjamites [[H1144]] came out [[H3318]] against them [[H7125]] from [[H4480]] Gibeah [[H1390]] and cut down [[H7843]] another [[H5750]] 18,000 [[H8083]] Israelites, [[H1121]] all [[H3605]] of them [[H428]] armed [[H8025]] with swords. [[H2719]]

### 26
Then [[H3605]] the Israelites, [[H3478]] all [[H3605]] the people, [[H5971]] went up [[H5927]] to Bethel, [[H1008]] where [[H8033]] they sat [[H3427]] weeping [[H1058]] before [[H6440]] the LORD. [[H3068]] That [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] they fasted [[H6684]] until [[H5704]] evening [[H6153]] and presented [[H5927]] burnt offerings [[H5930]] and peace offerings [[H8002]] to [[H6440]] the LORD. [[H3068]]

### 27
Then the Israelites [[H1121]] inquired [[H7592]] of the LORD. [[H3068]] (In those [[H1992]] days, [[H3117]] the ark [[H727]] of the covenant [[H1285]] of God [[H430]] was there, [[H8033]]

### 28
and Phinehas [[H6372]] son [[H1121]] of Eleazar, [[H499]] the son [[H1121]] of Aaron, [[H175]] served [[H5975]] before it.) [[H6440]] The Israelites asked, [[H559]] “Should we again [[H3254]] go out [[H3318]] to battle [[H4421]] against [[H5973]] our brothers [[H251]] the Benjamites, [[H1121]] or [[H518]] should we stop?” [[H2308]] The LORD [[H3068]] answered, [[H559]] “Fight, [[H5927]] for [[H3588]] tomorrow [[H4279]] I will deliver them [[H5414]] into your hands.” [[H3027]]

### 29
So Israel [[H3478]] set up [[H7760]] an ambush [[H693]] around [[H5439]] Gibeah. [[H1390]]

### 30
On the third [[H7992]] day [[H3117]] the Israelites [[H1121]] went up [[H5927]] against [[H413]] the Benjamites [[H1121]] and arrayed themselves [[H6186]] against [[H413]] Gibeah [[H1390]] as they had done before. [[H6471]]

### 31
The Benjamites [[H1121]] came out [[H3318]] against [[H7125]] [them] [[H5971]] and were drawn away [[H5423]] from [[H4480]] the city. [[H5892]] They began [[H2490]] to attack [[H5221]] the people [[H5971]] as before, [[H6471]] killing [[H2491]] about thirty [[H7970]] men [[H376]] of Israel [[H3478]] in the fields [[H7704]] and on the roads, [[H4546]] one [[H259]] of which [[H834]] led up [[H5927]] to  Bethel [[H1008]] and the other [[H259]] to Gibeah. [[H1390]]

### 32
“We are defeating [[H5062]] them as before,” [[H1992]] said [[H559]] the Benjamites. [[H1121]] But the Israelites [[H1121]] said, [[H559]] “Let us retreat [[H5127]] and draw them away [[H5423]] from [[H4480]] the city [[H5892]] onto [[H413]] the roads.” [[H4546]]

### 33
So all [[H3605]] the men [[H376]] of Israel [[H3478]] got up [[H6965]] from their places [[H4725]] and arrayed themselves [[H6186]] at Baal-tamar, [[H1193]] and the Israelites [[H3478]] in ambush [[H693]] charged [[H1518]] from their positions [[H4725]] west [[H4629]] of Gibeah. [[H1390]]

### 34
Then 10,000 [[H6235]] select [[H970]] men [[H376]] from all [[H3605]] Israel [[H3478]] made a frontal [[H5048]] assault [[H935]] against Gibeah, [[H1390]] and the battle [[H4421]] was fierce. [[H3513]] But the Benjamites [[H1992]] did not [[H3808]] realize [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] disaster [was] [[H7451]] upon [[H5060]] them. [[H5921]]

### 35
The LORD [[H3068]] defeated [[H5062]] Benjamin [[H1144]] in the presence [[H6440]] of Israel, [[H3478]] and on that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] the Israelites [[H1121]] slaughtered [[H7843]] 25,100 [[H6242]] Benjamites, [[H1144]] all [[H3605]] armed [[H8025]] with swords. [[H2719]]

### 36
Then the Benjamites [[H1121]] realized [[H7200]] they had been defeated. [[H5062]] Now the men [[H376]] of Israel [[H3478]] had retreated [[H5414]] before Benjamin, [[H1144]] because [[H3588]] they had confidence [[H982]] in [[H413]] the ambush [[H693]] they had set [[H7760]] against [[H413]] Gibeah. [[H1390]]

### 37
The men in ambush [[H693]] rushed [[H6584]] suddenly [[H2363]] against [[H413]] Gibeah; [[H1390]] they [[H693]] advanced [[H4900]] and put [[H5221]] the whole [[H3605]] city [[H5892]] to the sword. [[H2719]]

### 38
The men [[H376]] of Israel [[H3478]] had arranged [[H1961]] a signal [[H4150]] with [[H5973]] the men in ambush: [[H693]] When they sent up [[H5927]] a great [[H7235]] cloud [[H4864]] of smoke [[H6227]] from [[H4480]] the city, [[H5892]]

### 39
the men [[H376]] of Israel [[H3478]] would turn [[H2015]] in the battle. [[H4421]] When the Benjamites [[H1144]] had begun [[H2490]] to strike them down, [[H5221]] killing [[H2491]] about thirty [[H7970]] men [[H376]] of Israel, [[H3478]] they said, [[H559]] “They are [[H1931]] defeated [[H5062]] before us [[H6440]] as in the first [[H7223]] battle.” [[H4421]]

### 40
But when the column [[H5982]] of smoke [[H6227]] began [[H2490]] to go up [[H5927]] from [[H4480]] the city, [[H5892]] the Benjamites [[H1144]] looked [[H6437]] behind them [[H310]] and saw [[H2009]] the whole [[H3632]] city [[H5892]] going up [[H5927]] in smoke. [[H8064]]

### 41
Then the men [[H376]] of Israel [[H3478]] turned back on them, [[H2015]] and the men [[H376]] of Benjamin [[H1144]] were terrified [[H926]] when [[H3588]] they realized [[H7200]] that [[H3588]] disaster [[H7451]] had come [[H5060]] upon them. [[H5921]]

### 42
So they fled [[H6437]] before [[H6440]] the men [[H376]] of Israel [[H3478]] toward [[H413]] the wilderness, [[H4057]] but the battle [[H4421]] overtook them, [[H1692]] and the men [[H834]] coming out of the cities [[H5892]] struck them down [[H7843]] there. [[H8432]]

### 43
They surrounded [[H3803]] the Benjamites, [[H1144]] pursued them, [[H7291]] and easily [[H4496]] overtook them [[H1869]] in the vicinity [[H5704]] of Gibeah [[H1390]] on the east. [[H8121]]

### 44
And 18,000 [[H8083]] Benjamites [[H1144]] fell, [[H5307]] all [[H3605]] valiant warriors. [[H376]]

### 45
Then the Benjamites turned [[H6437]] and fled [[H5127]] toward the wilderness [[H4057]] to [[H413]] the rock [[H5553]] of Rimmon, [[H7417]] and Israel cut down [[H5953]] 5,000 [[H2568]] men [[H376]] on the roads. [[H4546]] And they overtook [[H1692]] them at [[H5704]] Gidom [[H1440]] and struck down [[H5221]] 2,000 more. [[H505]]

### 46
That [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] 25,000 [[H6242]] Benjamite [[H1144]] swordsmen [[H2719]] fell, [[H5307]] all [[H3605]] valiant warriors. [[H376]]

### 47
But six [[H8337]] hundred [[H3967]] men [[H376]] turned [[H6437]] and fled [[H5127]] into the wilderness [[H4057]] to [[H413]] the rock [[H5553]] of Rimmon, [[H7417]] where they stayed [[H3427]] four [[H702]] months. [[H2320]]

### 48
And the men [[H376]] of Israel [[H3478]] turned back [[H7725]] against [[H413]] the other Benjamites [[H1121]] and struck down [[H5221]] with the sword [[H2719]] all [[H4974]] the cities, [[H5892]] including the animals [[H929]] and [[H5704]] everything else [[H3605]] they found. [[H4672]] And they [[H1571]] burned down [[H7971]] all [[H3605]] the cities [[H5892]] in their path. [[H4672]]
