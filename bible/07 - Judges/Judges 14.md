###### 1
One day Samson [[H8123]] went down [[H3381]] to Timnah, [[H8553]] where he saw [[H7200]] a young Philistine [[H6430]] woman. [[H1323]]

###### 2
So he returned [[H5927]] and told [[H5046]] his father [[H1]] and his mother, [[H517]] “I have seen [[H7200]] a daughter [[H1323]] of the Philistines [[H6430]] in Timnah. [[H8553]] Now [[H6258]] get [[H3947]] her [[H853]] for me  as a wife.” [[H802]]

###### 3
But his father [[H1]] and mother [[H517]] replied, [[H559]] “Can you not [[H369]] find a young woman [[H1323]] among your relatives [[H251]] or any [[H3605]] of our people? [[H5971]] Must you [[H859]] go [[H1980]] to the uncircumcised [[H6189]] Philistines [[H6430]] to get [[H3947]] a wife?” [[H802]] But Samson [[H8123]] told [[H559]] his father, [[H1]] “Get [[H3947]] her [[H853]] for me,  for [[H3588]] she [[H1931]] is pleasing [[H3474]] to my eyes.” [[H5869]]

###### 4
(Now his father [[H1]] and mother [[H517]] did not [[H3808]] know [[H3045]] this [[H1931]] was from [[H3588]] the LORD, [[H3068]] who [[H1931]] was seeking [[H1245]] an occasion to move [[H8385]] against the Philistines; [[H6430]] for at that [[H1931]] time [[H6256]] the Philistines [[H6430]] were ruling [[H4910]] over Israel.) [[H3478]]

###### 5
Then Samson [[H8123]] went down [[H3381]] to Timnah [[H8553]] with his father [[H1]] and mother [[H517]] and came [[H935]] to [[H5704]] the vineyards [[H3754]] of Timnah. [[H8553]] Suddenly [[H2009]] a young lion [[H3715]] came roaring [[H7580]] at him, [[H7125]]

###### 6
and the Spirit [[H7307]] of the LORD [[H3068]] took control [[H6743]] of him, [[H5921]] and he tore the lion apart [[H8156]] with his bare [[H3972]] hands [[H3027]] as one would tear [[H8156]] a young goat. [[H1423]] But he did not [[H3808]] tell [[H5046]] his father [[H1]] or mother [[H517]] what [[H834]] he had done. [[H6213]]

###### 7
Then [Samson] continued on his way down [[H3381]] and spoke [[H1696]] to the woman, [[H802]] because [he] [[H8123]] wanted [[H3474]] her. [[H5869]]

###### 8
When [Samson] returned [[H7725]] later [[H3117]] to take her, [[H3947]] he left [[H5493]] the road to see [[H7200]] the lion’s [[H738]] carcass, [[H4658]] and in [it] [[H1472]] was [[H2009]] a swarm [[H5712]] of bees, [[H1682]] along with their honey. [[H1706]]

###### 9
So he scooped [[H7287]] some honey into [[H413]] his hands [[H3709]] and ate it [[H398]] as he went along. [[H1980]] When he returned [[H1980]] to [[H413]] his father [[H1]] and mother, [[H517]] he gave [[H5414]] some to them  and they ate it. [[H398]] But he did not [[H3808]] tell [[H5046]] them  that [[H3588]] he had taken [[H7287]] the honey [[H1706]] from the lion’s [[H738]] carcass. [[H1472]]

###### 10
Then his father [[H1]] went [[H3381]] to [[H413]] visit the woman, [[H802]] and Samson [[H8123]] prepared [[H6213]] a feast [[H4960]] there, [[H8033]] as [[H3588]] was customary [[H6213]] for the bridegroom. [[H970]]

###### 11
And when [[H1961]] [the Philistines] saw him, [[H7200]] they selected [[H3947]] thirty [[H7970]] men to accompany him. [[H4828]]

###### 12
“Let me tell [[H2330]] you a riddle,” [[H2420]] Samson [[H8123]] said to them. [[H559]] “If [[H518]] you can solve [[H5046]] it [[H853]] for me  [within the] seven [[H7651]] days [[H3117]] of the feast, [[H4960]] I will give [[H5414]] you  thirty [[H7970]] linen garments [[H5466]] and thirty [[H7970]] sets [[H2487]] of clothes. [[H899]]

###### 13
But if [[H518]] you cannot [[H3808]] solve it, [[H5046]] you [[H859]] must give [[H5414]] me  thirty [[H7970]] linen garments [[H5466]] and thirty [[H7970]] sets [[H2487]] of clothes.” [[H899]] “Tell [[H2330]] us your riddle,” [[H2420]] they replied. [[H559]] “Let us hear it.” [[H8085]]

###### 14
So he said to them: [[H559]] “Out of the eater [[H398]] came [[H3318]] something to eat, [[H3978]] and out of the strong [[H5794]] came [[H3318]] something sweet.” [[H4966]] For three [[H7969]] days [[H3117]] they were unable [[H3808]] to explain [[H5046]] the riddle. [[H2420]]

###### 15
So [[H1961]] on the fourth [[H7637]] day [[H3117]] they said [[H559]] to Samson’s [[H8123]] wife, [[H802]] “Entice [[H6601]] your husband [[H376]] to explain [[H5046]] the riddle to us, [[H2420]] or [[H6435]] we will burn [[H8313]] you [[H853]] and your father’s [[H1]] household [[H1004]] to death. [[H784]] Did you invite [[H7121]] us here  to rob us?” [[H3423]]

###### 16
Then Samson’s [[H8123]] wife [[H802]] came to him, [[H5921]] weeping, [[H1058]] and said, [[H559]] “You hate me! [[H8130]] You do not really [[H3808]] love me! [[H157]] You have posed [[H2330]] to my people [[H1121]] a riddle, [[H2420]] but have not [[H3808]] explained it to me.” [[H5046]] “Look,” [[H2009]] he said, [[H559]] “I have not [[H3808]] even explained [[H5046]] it to my father [[H1]] or mother, [[H517]] so why should I explain it [[H5046]] to you?” 

###### 17
She wept [[H1058]] the whole seven [[H7651]] days [[H3117]] of the feast, [[H4960]] and finally [[H1961]] on the seventh [[H7637]] day, [[H3117]] because [[H3588]] she had pressed him so much, [[H6693]] he told [[H5046]] her [the answer].  And in turn she explained [[H5046]] the riddle [[H2420]] to her people. [[H1121]]

###### 18
Before [[H2962]] sunset [[H935]] on the seventh [[H7637]] day, [[H3117]] the men [[H376]] of the city [[H5892]] said [[H559]] to [Samson]:  “What [[H4100]] is sweeter [[H4966]] than honey? [[H1706]] And what [is] [[H4100]] stronger [[H5794]] than a lion?” [[H738]] So he said to them: [[H559]] “If you had not [[H3884]] plowed [[H2790]] with my heifer, [[H5697]] you would not [[H3808]] have solved [[H4672]] my riddle!” [[H2420]]

###### 19
Then the Spirit [[H7307]] of the LORD [[H3068]] came mightily [[H6743]] upon him, [[H5921]] and he went down [[H3381]] to Ashkelon, [[H831]] killed [[H5221]] thirty [[H7970]] of their men, [[H376]] took [[H3947]] their apparel, [[H2488]] and gave [[H5414]] their clothes [[H2487]] to those who had solved [[H5046]] the riddle. [[H2420]] And burning [[H2734]] with anger, [[H639]] Samson returned [[H5927]] to his fathers [[H1]] house, [[H1004]]

###### 20
and his [[H8123]] wife [[H802]] was given [[H1961]] to one of the men who [[H834]] had accompanied [[H7462]] him.
