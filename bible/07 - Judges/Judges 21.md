# Judges 21

[[Judges 20|←]] • [[Ruth 1|→]]

---

###### 1
Now the men [[H376]] of Israel [[H3478]] had sworn an oath [[H7650]] at Mizpah, [[H4709]] saying, [[H559]] “Not one [[H376]] of us [[H4480]] will give his daughter [[H1323]] in marriage [[H5414]] to a Benjamite.” [[H1144]]

###### 2
So the people [[H5971]] came [[H935]] to Bethel [[H1008]] and sat [[H3427]] there [[H8033]] before [[H6440]] God [[H430]] until [[H5704]] evening, [[H6153]] lifting up [[H5375]] their voices [[H6963]] and weeping [[H1058]] bitterly. [[H1419]]

###### 3
“Why, [[H4100]] O LORD [[H3068]] God [[H430]] of Israel,” [[H3478]] they cried out, [[H559]] “has this [[H2063]] happened [[H1961]] in Israel? [[H3478]] Today [[H3117]] in Israel [[H3478]] one [[H259]] tribe [[H7626]] is missing!” [[H6485]]

###### 4
The next day [[H4283]] the people [[H5971]] got up early, [[H7925]] built [[H1129]] an altar [[H4196]] there, [[H8033]] and presented [[H5927]] burnt offerings [[H5930]] and peace offerings. [[H8002]]

###### 5
The Israelites [[H1121]] asked, [[H559]] “Who [[H4310]] among all [[H3605]] the tribes [[H7626]] of Israel [[H3478]] did not [[H3808]] come [[H5927]] to the assembly [[H6951]] before [[H413]] the LORD?” [[H3068]] For [[H3588]] they had taken [[H1961]] a solemn [[H1419]] oath [[H7621]] that anyone [[H834]] who failed [[H3808]] to come up [[H5927]] before [[H413]] the LORD [[H3068]] at Mizpah [[H4709]] would surely be put to death. [[H4191]]

###### 6
And the Israelites [[H1121]] grieved [[H5162]] for [[H413]] their brothers, [[H251]] the Benjamites, [[H1144]] and said, [[H559]] “Today [[H3117]] a [[H259]] tribe [[H7626]] is cut off [[H1438]] from Israel. [[H3478]]

###### 7
What [[H4100]] should we do [[H6213]] about wives [[H802]] for the survivors, [[H3498]] since we [[H587]] have sworn [[H7650]] by the LORD [[H3068]] not [[H1115]] to give [[H5414]] them  our daughters [[H1323]] in marriage?” [[H802]]

###### 8
So they asked, [[H559]] “Which [[H4310]] one [[H259]] of the tribes [[H7626]] of Israel [[H3478]] failed [[H3808]] to come up [[H5927]] before [[H413]] the LORD [[H3068]] at Mizpah?” [[H4709]] And in fact, [[H2009]] no one [[H3808]] from Jabesh-gilead [[H3003]] had come [[H935]] to [[H413]] the camp [[H4264]] for the assembly. [[H6951]]

###### 9
For when the people [[H5971]] were counted, [[H6485]] none [[H369]] of the residents [[H3427]] of Jabesh-gilead [[H3003]] were there. [[H8033]]

###### 10
So the congregation [[H5712]] sent [[H7971]] 12,000 [[H8147]] of [[H1121]] their most valiant [[H2428]] men [[H376]] and commanded them: [[H6680]] “Go [[H1980]] and put [[H5221]] to the sword [[H2719]] those living [[H3427]] in Jabesh-gilead, [[H3003]] including women [[H802]] and children. [[H2945]]

###### 11
This [[H2088]] is what [[H834]] you are to do: [[H6213]] Completely destroy [[H2763]] every [[H3605]] male, [[H2145]] as well as every [[H3605]] female [[H802]] who has had relations with [[H3045]] a man.” [[H2145]]

###### 12
So they found [[H4672]] among the inhabitants [[H3427]] of Jabesh-gilead [[H3003]] four [[H702]] hundred [[H3967]] young [[H5291]] women [[H1330]] who [[H834]] had not [[H3808]] had relations with [[H3045]] a man, [[H2145]] and they brought [[H935]] them to [[H413]] the camp [[H4264]] at Shiloh [[H7887]] in the land [[H776]] of Canaan. [[H3667]]

###### 13
Then the whole [[H3605]] congregation [[H5712]] sent [[H7971]] a message [[H1696]] of peace [[H7965]] to [[H413]] the Benjamites [[H1121]] who [[H834]] were at the rock [[H5553]] of Rimmon. [[H7417]]

###### 14
And at that [[H1931]] time [[H6256]] the Benjamites [[H1144]] returned [[H7725]] and were given [[H5414]] the women [[H802]] who were spared [[H2421]] from Jabesh-gilead. [[H3003]] But there were not [[H3808]] enough [women] [[H3651]] for all of them. 

###### 15
The people [[H5971]] grieved [[H5162]] for Benjamin, [[H1144]] because [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] had made [[H6213]] a void [[H6556]] in the tribes [[H7626]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

###### 16
Then the elders [[H2205]] of the congregation [[H5712]] said, [[H559]] “What [[H4100]] should we do [[H6213]] about wives [[H802]] for those who remain, [[H3498]] since [[H3588]] the women [[H802]] of Benjamin [[H1144]] have been destroyed?” [[H8045]]

###### 17
They added, [[H559]] “There must be heirs [[H3425]] for the survivors [[H6413]] of Benjamin, [[H1144]] so that a tribe [[H7626]] of Israel [[H3478]] will not [[H3808]] be wiped out. [[H4229]]

###### 18
But we [[H587]] cannot [[H3808]] give [[H5414]] them our daughters [[H1323]] as wives.” [[H802]] For [[H3588]] the Israelites [[H1121]] had sworn, [[H7650]] “Cursed [is] [[H779]] he who gives [[H5414]] a wife [[H802]] to a Benjamite.” [[H1144]]

###### 19
“But look,” [[H2009]] they said, [[H559]] “there is a yearly [[H3117]] feast [[H2282]] to the LORD [[H3068]] in Shiloh, [[H7887]] which [is] [[H834]] north [[H6828]] of  Bethel [[H1008]] east [[H8121]] of the road [[H4546]] that goes up [[H5927]] from  Bethel [[H1008]] to Shechem, [[H7927]] and south [[H5045]] of Lebonah.” [[H3829]]

###### 20
So they commanded [[H6680]] the Benjamites: [[H1121]] “Go, [[H1980]] hide [[H693]] in the vineyards [[H3754]]

###### 21
and watch. [[H7200]] When [[H518]] you see [[H2009]] the daughters [[H1323]] of Shiloh [[H7887]] come out [[H3318]] to perform [[H2342]] their dances, [[H4246]] each of you [[H376]] is to come out [[H3318]] of the vineyards, [[H3754]] catch [[H2414]] for himself  a wife [[H802]] from [[H4480]] the daughters [[H1323]] of Shiloh, [[H7887]] and go [[H1980]] to the land [[H776]] of Benjamin. [[H1144]]

###### 22
When [[H3588]] their fathers [[H1]] or [[H176]] brothers [[H251]] come [[H935]] to us [[H413]] to complain, [[H7378]] we will tell them, [[H559]] ‘Do us a favor [[H2603]] by [helping] them, [[H853]] since [[H3588]] we did not [[H3808]] get [[H3947]] wives [[H802]] for each of them [[H376]] in the war. [[H4421]] Since [[H3588]] you [[H859]] did not [[H3808]] actually [[H6256]] give [[H5414]] them [your daughters],  you have no guilt. [[H816]]

###### 23
The Benjamites [[H1121]] did [[H6213]] [as instructed] [[H3651]] and carried away [[H5375]] the number [[H4557]] of women [[H802]] they needed from [[H4480]] the dancers [[H2342]] they caught. [[H1497]] They went [[H1980]] back [[H7725]] to [[H413]] their own inheritance, [[H5159]] rebuilt [[H1129]] their cities, [[H5892]] and settled [[H3427]] in them. 

###### 24
And at that [[H1931]] time, [[H6256]] each [[H376]] of the Israelites [[H1121]] returned [[H1980]] from there [[H8033]] to his own tribe [[H7626]] and clan, [[H4940]] each [[H376]] to his own inheritance. [[H5159]]

###### 25
In those [[H1992]] days [[H3117]] there was no [[H369]] king [[H4428]] in Israel; [[H3478]] everyone [[H376]] did [what was] [[H6213]] right [[H3477]] in his own eyes. [[H5869]]
