### 1
Now Jephthah [[H3316]] the Gileadite [[H1569]] was [[H1961]] a mighty [[H2428]] warrior; [[H1368]] he [[H1931]] was the son [[H1121]] of a prostitute, [[H2181]] and Gilead [[H1568]] was his [[H3316]] father. [[H3205]]

### 2
And Gilead’s [[H1568]] wife [[H802]] bore [[H3205]] him sons, [[H1121]] who [[H1121]] grew up, [[H1431]] drove Jephthah [[H3316]] out, [[H1644]] and said [[H559]] to him,  “You shall have no [[H3808]] inheritance [[H5157]] in our father’s [[H1]] house, [[H1004]] because [[H3588]] you [[H859]] are the son [[H1121]] of another [[H312]] woman.” [[H802]]

### 3
So Jephthah [[H3316]] fled [[H1272]] from [[H6440]] his brothers [[H251]] and settled [[H3427]] in the land [[H776]] of Tob, [[H2897]] where a group of rebels [[H7386]] joined [[H3950]] him [[H3316]] and traveled [[H3318]] with him. [[H5973]]

### 4
Some time later, [[H1961]] when the Ammonites [[H1121]] fought [[H3898]] against [[H5973]] Israel [[H3478]]

### 5
and [[H1961]] made war [[H3898]] with [[H5973]] [them], [[H3478]] the elders [[H2205]] of Gilead [[H1568]] went [[H1980]] to get [[H3947]] Jephthah [[H3316]] from the land [[H776]] of Tob. [[H2897]]

### 6
“Come,” [[H1980]] they said, [[H559]] “be [[H1961]] our commander, [[H7101]] so that we can fight [[H3898]] against the Ammonites.” [[H1121]]

### 7
Jephthah [[H3316]] replied [[H559]] to the elders [[H2205]] of Gilead, [[H1568]] “Did you [[H859]] not [[H3808]] hate [[H8130]] me [[H853]] and expel me [[H1644]] from my father’s [[H1]] house? [[H1004]] So why [[H4069]] then have you come [[H935]] to me [[H413]] now [[H6258]] when [[H834]] you are in distress?” [[H6862]]

### 8
They [[H2205]] answered [[H559]] Jephthah, [[H3316]] “This is why [[H3651]] we now [[H6258]] turn [[H7725]] to you, [[H413]] that you may go [[H1980]] with us, [[H5973]] fight [[H3898]] the Ammonites, [[H1121]] and become [[H1961]] leader [[H7218]] over all [[H3605]] of us  who live [[H3427]] in Gilead.” [[H1568]]

### 9
But Jephthah [[H3316]] answered, [[H559]] “If [[H518]] you [[H859]] take me back [[H7725]] to fight [[H3898]] the Ammonites [[H1121]] and the LORD [[H3068]] gives [[H5414]] them to me, [[H6440]] will I [[H595]] really be [[H1961]] your leader?” [[H7218]]

### 10
And the elders [[H2205]] of Gilead [[H1568]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Jephthah, [[H3316]] “The LORD [[H3068]] is [[H1961]] our witness [[H8085]] if [[H518]] we do not [[H3808]] do [[H6213]] as you say.” [[H1697]]

### 11
So Jephthah [[H3316]] went [[H1980]] with [[H5973]] the elders [[H2205]] of Gilead, [[H1568]] and the people [[H5971]] put [[H7760]] him over themselves [[H5921]] as leader [[H7218]] and commander. [[H7101]] And Jephthah [[H3316]] repeated [[H1696]] all [[H3605]] his terms [[H1697]] in the presence [[H6440]] of the LORD [[H3068]] at Mizpah. [[H4709]]

### 12
Then Jephthah [[H3316]] sent [[H7971]] messengers [[H4397]] to [[H413]] the king [[H4428]] of the Ammonites, [[H1121]] saying, [[H559]] “What [[H4100]] do you have against me  that [[H3588]] you have come [[H935]] to fight [[H3898]] against [[H413]] my land?” [[H776]]

### 13
The king [[H4428]] of the Ammonites [[H1121]] answered [[H559]] Jephthah’s [[H3316]] messengers, [[H4397]] “When Israel [[H3478]] came up [[H5927]] out of Egypt, [[H4714]] they seized [[H3947]] my land, [[H776]] from the Arnon [[H769]] to [[H5704]] the Jabbok [[H2999]] and all the way [[H5704]] to the Jordan. [[H3383]] Now, therefore, [[H6258]] restore [[H7725]] it [[H853]] peaceably.” [[H7965]]

### 14
Jephthah [[H3316]] again [[H3254]] sent [[H7971]] messengers [[H4397]] to [[H413]] the king [[H4428]] of the Ammonites [[H1121]]

### 15
to tell him, [[H559]] “This is what [[H3541]] Jephthah [[H3316]] says: [[H559]] Israel [[H3478]] did not [[H3808]] take away [[H3947]] the land [[H776]] of Moab [[H4124]] [or] [[H776]] of the Ammonites. [[H5983]]

### 16
But [[H3588]] when [Israel] came up [[H5927]] out of Egypt, [[H4714]] [they] [[H3478]] traveled [[H1980]] through the wilderness [[H4057]] to [[H5704]] the Red [[H5488]] Sea [[H3220]] and came [[H935]] to Kadesh. [[H6946]]

### 17
Then Israel [[H3478]] sent [[H7971]] messengers [[H4397]] to [[H413]] the king [[H4428]] of Edom, [[H123]] saying, [[H559]] ‘Please [[H4994]] let us pass [[H5674]] through your land,’ [[H776]] but the king [[H4428]] of Edom [[H123]] would not [[H3808]] listen. [[H8085]] They also [[H1571]] sent [[H7971]] messengers to [[H413]] the king [[H4428]] of Moab, [[H4124]] but he refused. [[H3808]] So Israel [[H3478]] stayed [[H3427]] in Kadesh. [[H6946]]

### 18
Then [Israel] traveled [[H1980]] through the wilderness [[H4057]] and bypassed [[H5437]] the lands [[H776]] of Edom [[H123]] and Moab. [[H4124]] They came [[H935]] to [[H4217]] the east side [[H8121]] of the land [[H776]] of Moab [[H4124]] and camped [[H2583]] on the other side [[H5676]] of the Arnon. [[H769]] But they did not [[H3808]] enter [[H935]] the territory [[H1366]] of Moab, [[H4124]] since [[H3588]] the Arnon [[H769]] was its border. [[H1366]]

### 19
And Israel [[H3478]] sent [[H7971]] messengers [[H4397]] to [[H413]] Sihon [[H5511]] king [[H4428]] of the Amorites, [[H567]] who ruled [[H4428]] in Heshbon, [[H2809]] and said [[H559]] to him,  ‘Please [[H4994]] let us pass [[H5674]] through your land [[H776]] into [[H5704]] our own place.’ [[H4725]]

### 20
But Sihon [[H5511]] would not [[H3808]] trust [[H539]] Israel [[H3478]] to pass [[H5674]] through his territory. [[H1366]] So [he] [[H5511]] gathered [[H622]] all [[H3605]] his people, [[H5971]] encamped [[H2583]] in Jahaz, [[H3096]] and fought [[H3898]] with [[H5973]] Israel. [[H3478]]

### 21
Then the LORD, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] delivered [[H5414]] Sihon [[H5511]] and all [[H3605]] his people [[H5971]] into the hands [[H3027]] of Israel, [[H3478]] who defeated them. [[H5221]] So Israel [[H3478]] took possession of [[H3423]] all [[H3605]] the land [[H776]] of the Amorites [[H567]] who inhabited [[H3427]] that [[H1931]] country, [[H776]]

### 22
seizing [[H3423]] all [[H3605]] the land [[H1366]] from [[H4480]] the Arnon [[H769]] to [[H5704]] the Jabbok [[H2999]] and from the wilderness [[H4057]] to [[H5704]] the Jordan. [[H3383]]

### 23
Now since [[H6258]] the LORD, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] has driven out [[H3423]] the Amorites [[H567]] from before [[H6440]] His people [[H5971]] Israel, [[H3478]] should you now [[H859]] possess it? [[H3423]]

### 24
Do you not [[H3808]] possess [[H3423]] whatever [[H834]] your god [[H430]] Chemosh [[H3645]] grants you? [[H3423]] So also, [[H853]] we possess [[H3423]] whatever [[H3605]] the LORD [[H3068]] our God [[H430]] has granted [[H3423]] us. [[H6440]]

### 25
Are you [[H859]] now [[H6258]] so much [[H2896]] better [[H2896]] than Balak [[H1111]] son [[H1121]] of Zippor, [[H6834]] king [[H4428]] of Moab? [[H4124]] Did he ever contend [[H7378]] with [[H5973]] Israel [[H3478]] or [[H518]] fight [[H3898]] against them? 

### 26
For three [[H7969]] hundred [[H3967]] years [[H8141]] Israel [[H3478]] has lived [[H3427]] in Heshbon, [[H2809]] Aroer, [[H6177]] and their villages, [[H1323]] as well as all [[H3605]] the cities [[H5892]] along [[H5921]] the banks [[H3027]] of the Arnon. [[H769]] Why [[H4069]] did you not [[H3808]] take them back [[H5337]] during that [[H1931]] time? [[H6256]]

### 27
I [[H595]] have not [[H3808]] sinned [[H2398]] against you,  but you [[H859]] have done [[H6213]] me [[H853]] wrong [[H7451]] by waging war [[H3898]] against me.  May the LORD, [[H3068]] the Judge, [[H8199]] decide [[H8199]] today [[H3117]] between [[H996]] the Israelites [[H1121]] and the Ammonites.” [[H1121]]

### 28
But the king [[H4428]] of the Ammonites [[H1121]] paid no [[H3808]] heed [[H8085]] to [[H413]] the message [[H1697]] Jephthah [[H3316]] sent [[H7971]] him. [[H413]]

### 29
Then the Spirit [[H7307]] of the LORD [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] upon [[H5921]] Jephthah, [[H3316]] and he passed through [[H5674]] Gilead [[H1568]] and [[H853]] Manasseh, [[H4519]] then through [[H5674]] Mizpah [[H4708]] of Gilead. [[H1568]] And from [there] [[H4708]] he advanced [[H5674]] against the Ammonites. [[H1121]]

### 30
Jephthah [[H3316]] made [[H5087]] this vow [[H5088]] to the LORD: [[H3068]] “If [[H518]] indeed [[H5414]] You will deliver [[H5414]] the Ammonites [[H1121]] into my hands, [[H3027]]

### 31
then whatever [[H834]] comes out [[H3318]] of the door [[H1817]] of my house [[H1004]] to greet me [[H7125]] on my triumphant [[H7965]] return [[H7725]] from the Ammonites [[H1121]] will belong to [[H1961]] the LORD, [[H3068]] and I will offer it up [[H5927]] as a burnt offering.” [[H5930]]

### 32
So Jephthah [[H3316]] crossed over [[H5674]] to [[H413]] the Ammonites [[H1121]] to fight against them, [[H3898]] and the LORD [[H3068]] delivered them [[H5414]] into his hands. [[H3027]]

### 33
With a great [[H1419]] blow [[H4347]] he devastated [[H5221]] twenty [[H6242]] cities [[H5892]] from Aroer [[H6177]] to [[H5704]] the vicinity [[H935]] of Minnith, [[H4511]] as far as [[H5704]] Abel-keramim. [[H58]] So the Ammonites [[H1121]] were subdued [[H3665]] before [[H6440]] the Israelites. [[H1121]]

### 34
And when Jephthah [[H3316]] returned [[H935]] home [[H1004]] to Mizpah, [[H4709]] there [[H2009]] was his daughter [[H1323]] coming out [[H3318]] to meet him [[H7125]] with tambourines [[H8596]] and dancing! [[H4246]] She [[H1931]] was his only child; [[H3173]] he had  no [[H369]] son [[H1121]] or [[H176]] daughter [[H1323]] besides her. [[H4480]]

### 35
As soon as [[H1961]] [Jephthah] saw [[H7200]] her, [[H853]] he tore [[H7167]] his clothes [[H899]] and said, [[H559]] “No! [[H162]] Not my daughter! [[H1323]] You have brought me to my knees! [[H3766]] You [[H859]] have brought great misery upon me, [[H5916]] for I [[H595]] have given my word [[H6475]] to [[H413]] the LORD [[H3068]] and cannot [[H3808]] take it back.” [[H7725]]

### 36
“My father,” [[H1]] she replied, [[H559]] “you have given your word [[H6475]] to [[H413]] the LORD. [[H3068]] Do [[H6213]] to me as [[H834]] you have said, [[H3318]] for [[H310]] the LORD [[H3068]] has [[H6213]] avenged [[H5360]] you  of your enemies, [[H341]] the Ammonites.” [[H1121]]

### 37
She also said [[H559]] to [[H413]] her father, [[H1]] “Let me do [[H6213]] this [[H2088]] one thing: [[H1697]] Let me wander [[H1980]] for two [[H8147]] months [[H2320]] through [[H5921]] the mountains [[H2022]] with my friends [[H7474]] and mourn [[H1058]] my virginity.” [[H1331]]

### 38
“Go,” [[H1980]] he said. [[H559]] And he sent her away [[H7971]] for two [[H8147]] months. [[H2320]] So she [[H1931]] left [[H1980]] with her friends [[H7464]] and mourned [[H1058]] her virginity [[H1331]] upon [[H5921]] the mountains. [[H2022]]

### 39
After [[H7093]] two [[H8147]] months, [[H2320]] she returned [[H7725]] to [[H413]] her father, [[H1]] and he did [[H6213]] to her  as he had vowed. [[H5087]] And she [[H1931]] had never [[H3808]] had relations [[H3045]] with a man. [[H376]] So it has become [[H1961]] a custom [[H2706]] in Israel [[H3478]]

### 40
that each year [[H3117]] the young women [[H1323]] of Israel [[H3478]] go out [[H1980]] for four [[H702]] days [[H3117]] to lament [[H8567]] the daughter [[H1323]] of Jephthah [[H3316]] the Gileadite. [[H1569]]
