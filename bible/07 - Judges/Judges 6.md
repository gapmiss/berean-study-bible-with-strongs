###### 1
Again the Israelites [[H1121]] did [[H6213]] evil [[H7451]] in the sight [[H5869]] of the LORD; [[H3068]] so He [[H3068]] handed them over to [[H5414]] Midian [[H4080]] for seven [[H7651]] years, [[H8141]]

###### 2
and the hand [[H3027]] of Midian [[H4080]] prevailed [[H5810]] against [[H5921]] Israel. [[H3478]] Because of [[H6440]] the Midianites, [[H4080]] the Israelites [[H1121]] prepared [[H6213]] shelters [[H4492]] for themselves  in the mountains, [[H2022]] caves, [[H4631]] and strongholds. [[H4679]]

###### 3
Whenever [[H518]] the Israelites [[H3478]] would plant their crops, [[H2232]] the Midianites, [[H4080]] Amalekites, [[H6002]] and other people [[H1121]] of the East [[H6924]] would come up [[H5927]] and invade [[H5927]] them, [[H5921]]

###### 4
encamping [[H2583]] against them [[H5921]] as far as [[H5704]] Gaza [[H5804]] and destroying [[H7843]] the produce [[H2981]] of the land. [[H776]] They left [[H7604]] Israel [[H3478]] with no [[H3808]] sustenance, [[H4241]] neither sheep [[H7716]] nor oxen [[H7794]] nor donkeys. [[H2543]]

###### 5
For [[H3588]] the Midianites [[H1992]] came [[H935]] with their livestock [[H4735]] and their tents [[H168]] like a great [[H7230]] swarm [[H1767]] of locusts. [[H697]] They and their camels [[H1581]] were innumerable, [[H369]] and they entered [[H935]] the land [[H776]] to ravage it. [[H7843]]

###### 6
Israel [[H3478]] was greatly [[H3966]] impoverished [[H1809]] by [[H6440]] Midian, [[H4080]] and the Israelites [[H1121]] cried out [[H2199]] to [[H413]] the LORD. [[H3068]]

###### 7
Now [[H1961]] when [[H3588]] the Israelites [[H1121]] cried out [[H2199]] to [[H413]] the LORD [[H3068]] because of [[H5921]] Midian, [[H4080]]

###### 8
[He] [[H3068]] sent [[H7971]] them [[H1121]] a prophet [[H5030]] who said, [[H559]] “This is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] God [[H430]] of Israel [[H3478]] says: [[H559]] I [[H595]] brought [[H5927]] you up out of [[H853]] Egypt, [[H4714]] out of the house [[H1004]] of slavery. [[H5650]]

###### 9
I delivered [[H5337]] you [[H853]] out of the hands [[H3027]] of Egypt [[H4713]] [and] [[H3027]] all [[H3605]] your oppressors. [[H3905]] I drove them out [[H1644]] before you [[H6440]] and gave [[H5414]] you  their land. [[H776]]

###### 10
And I said [[H559]] to you:  ‘I [[H589]] am the LORD [[H3068]] your God. [[H430]] You must not [[H3808]] worship [[H3372]] the gods [[H430]] of the Amorites, [[H567]] in whose [[H834]] land [[H776]] you [[H859]] dwell.’ [[H3427]] But you did not [[H3808]] obey Me.” [[H8085]]

###### 11
Then the Angel [[H4397]] of the LORD [[H3068]] came [[H935]] and sat down [[H3427]] under [[H8478]] the oak [[H424]] in Ophrah [[H6084]] that [[H834]] belonged to Joash [[H3101]] the Abiezrite, [[H33]] where his son [[H1121]] Gideon [[H1439]] was threshing [[H2251]] wheat [[H2406]] in a winepress [[H1660]] to hide it [[H5127]] from [[H6440]] the Midianites. [[H4080]]

###### 12
And the Angel [[H4397]] of the LORD [[H3068]] appeared [[H7200]] to [Gideon] [[H413]] and said, [[H559]] “The LORD [[H3068]] is with you, [[H5973]] mighty [[H2428]] warrior.” [[H1368]]

###### 13
“Pardon me, [[H994]] Sir,” [[H113]] Gideon [[H1439]] replied, [[H559]] “but if the LORD [[H3068]] is [[H3426]] with us, [[H5973]] why [[H4100]] has all [[H3605]] this [[H2063]] happened to us? [[H4672]] And where [[H346]] are all [[H3605]] His wonders [[H6381]] about which [[H834]] our fathers [[H1]] told [[H5608]] us,  saying, [[H559]] Has not [[H3808]] the LORD [[H3068]] brought us up [[H5927]] out of Egypt? [[H4714]] But now [[H6258]] the LORD [[H3068]] has forsaken us [[H5203]] and delivered us [[H5414]] into the hand [[H3709]] of Midian.” [[H4080]]

###### 14
The LORD [[H3068]] turned [[H6437]] to him [[H413]] and said, [[H559]] “Go [[H1980]] in the strength you have [[H3581]] and deliver [[H3467]] Israel [[H3478]] from the hand [[H3709]] of Midian. [[H4080]] Am I not [[H3808]] sending you?” [[H7971]]

###### 15
“Please, [[H994]] Lord,” [[H136]] [Gideon] asked, [[H559]] “how [[H4100]] can I deliver [[H3467]] Israel? [[H3478]] Indeed, [[H2009]] my clan [[H504]] is the weakest [[H1800]] in Manasseh, [[H4519]] and I [[H595]] am the youngest [[H6810]] in my father’s [[H1]] house.” [[H1004]]

###### 16
“Surely [[H3588]] I will be [[H1961]] with you,” [[H5973]] the LORD [[H3068]] replied, [[H559]] “and you will strike down [[H5221]] [all] the Midianites [[H4080]] as one [[H259]] man.” [[H376]]

###### 17
Gideon answered, [[H559]] “If [[H518]] I have found [[H4672]] favor [[H2580]] in Your sight, [[H5869]] give [[H6213]] me a sign [[H226]] that [it is] You [[H859]] speaking [[H1696]] with me. [[H5973]]

###### 18
Please [[H4994]] do not [[H408]] depart [[H4185]] from this [place] [[H2088]] until [[H5704]] I return [[H935]] to You. [[H413]] Let me bring [[H3318]] my gift [[H4503]] and set [it] [[H3240]] before You.” [[H6440]] And [the LORD] said, [[H559]] “I [[H595]] will stay [[H3427]] until [[H5704]] you return.” [[H7725]]

###### 19
So Gideon [[H1439]] went in [[H935]] and prepared [[H6213]] a young goat [[H1423]] and unleavened bread [[H4682]] and an ephah [[H374]] of flour. [[H7058]] He placed [[H7760]] the meat [[H1320]] in a basket [[H5536]] and the broth [[H4839]] in a pot [[H6517]] and brought them out [[H3318]] to present [[H5066]] to Him [[H413]] under [[H8478]] the oak. [[H424]]

###### 20
And the Angel [[H4397]] of God [[H430]] said [[H559]] to him, [[H413]] “Take [[H3947]] the meat [[H1320]] and [[H853]] the unleavened bread, [[H4682]] lay [them] [[H3240]] on [[H413]] this [[H1975]] rock, [[H5553]] and [[H853]] pour out [[H8210]] the broth.” [[H4839]] And [Gideon] did [[H6213]] so. [[H3651]]

###### 21
Then the Angel [[H4397]] of the LORD [[H3068]] extended [[H7971]] the tip [[H7097]] of the staff [[H4938]] that [[H834]] was in His hand [[H3027]] and touched [[H5060]] the meat [[H1320]] and the unleavened bread. [[H4682]] And fire [[H784]] flared [[H5927]] from [[H4480]] the rock [[H6697]] and consumed [[H398]] the meat [[H1320]] and the unleavened bread. [[H4682]] Then the Angel [[H4397]] of the LORD [[H3068]] vanished [[H1980]] from his sight. [[H5869]]

###### 22
When Gideon [[H1439]] realized [[H7200]] that [[H3588]] it [was] [[H1931]] the Angel [[H4397]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] he [[H1439]] said, [[H559]] “Oh no, [[H162]] Lord [[H136]] GOD! [[H3069]] I have seen [[H7200]] the Angel [[H4397]] of the LORD [[H3068]] face [[H6440]] to [[H413]] face!” [[H6440]]

###### 23
But the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H559]] to him,  “Peace [be] [[H7965]] with you.  Do not [[H408]] be afraid, [[H3372]] for you will not [[H3808]] die.” [[H4191]]

###### 24
So Gideon [[H1439]] built [[H1129]] an altar [[H4196]] to the LORD [[H3068]] there [[H8033]] and called [[H7121]] it  The LORD [[H3068]] is Peace. [[H7965]] To [[H5704]] this [[H2088]] day [[H3117]] it stands [[H5750]] in Ophrah [[H6084]] of the Abiezrites. [[H33]]

###### 25
On that very [[H1931]] night [[H3915]] the LORD [[H3068]] said to [Gideon], [[H559]] “Take [[H3947]] your father’s [[H1]] young bull [[H6499]] and a second [[H8145]] bull [[H6499]] seven [[H7651]] years old, [[H8141]] tear down [[H2040]] your father's [[H1]] altar [[H4196]] to Baal, [[H1168]] and cut down [[H3772]] the Asherah pole [[H842]] beside it. [[H5921]]

###### 26
Then build [[H1129]] a proper [[H4634]] altar [[H4196]] to the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] on [[H5921]] the top [[H7218]] of this [[H2088]] stronghold. [[H4581]] And with the wood [[H6086]] of the Asherah pole [[H842]] you cut down, [[H3772]] take [[H3947]] the second [[H8145]] bull [[H6499]] and offer [[H5927]] it as a burnt offering.” [[H5930]]

###### 27
So Gideon [[H1439]] took [[H3947]] ten [[H6235]] of his servants [[H5650]] and did [[H6213]] as [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] had told him. [[H1696]] But because [[H834]] he was too afraid [[H3372]] of his father’s [[H1]] household [[H1004]] and [[H853]] the men [[H376]] of the city, [[H5892]] he did [it] [[H6213]] by night [[H3915]] [rather than] [[H6213]] in the daytime. [[H3119]]

###### 28
When the men [[H376]] of the city [[H5892]] got up [[H7925]] in the morning, [[H1242]] they found [[H2009]] Baal’s [[H1168]] altar [[H4196]] torn down, [[H5422]] the Asherah pole [[H842]] beside [[H5921]] it cut down, [[H3772]] and the second [[H8145]] bull [[H6499]] offered up [[H5927]] on [[H5921]] the newly built [[H1129]] altar. [[H4196]]

###### 29
“Who [[H4310]] did [[H6213]] this?” [[H2088]] they said [[H559]] to [[H413]] one [[H376]] another. [[H7453]] And after they had investigated thoroughly, [[H1875]] they were told, [[H559]] “Gideon [[H1439]] son [[H1121]] of Joash [[H3101]] did [[H6213]] it.” [[H2088]]

###### 30
Then the men [[H376]] of the city [[H5892]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Joash, [[H3101]] “Bring out [[H3318]] your son. [[H1121]] He must die, [[H4191]] because [[H3588]] he has torn down [[H5422]] Baal’s [[H1168]] altar [[H4196]] and cut down [[H3772]] the Asherah pole [[H842]] beside it.” [[H5921]]

###### 31
But Joash [[H3101]] said [[H559]] to all [[H3605]] who [[H834]] stood [[H5975]] against him, [[H5921]] “Are you [[H859]] contending [[H7378]] for Baal? [[H1168]] Are you [[H859]] trying to save him? [[H3467]] Whoever [[H834]] pleads his case [[H7378]] will be put to death [[H4191]] by [[H5704]] morning! [[H1242]] If [[H518]] [Baal] [[H1931]] is a god, [[H430]] let him contend [[H7378]] for himself  if [[H3588]] someone has torn down [[H5422]] his altar. [[H4196]]

###### 32
So on that day [[H3117]] Gideon was called [[H7121]] Jerubbaal, [[H3378]] that is to say, [[H559]] “Let Baal [[H1168]] contend [[H7378]] with him,”  because [[H3588]] he had torn down [[H5422]] his altar. [[H4196]]

###### 33
Then all [[H3605]] the Midianites, [[H4080]] Amalekites, [[H6002]] and other people [[H1121]] of the East [[H6924]] gathered [[H622]] together, [[H3162]] crossed over [the Jordan], [[H5674]] and camped [[H2583]] in the Valley [[H6010]] of Jezreel. [[H3157]]

###### 34
So the Spirit [[H7307]] of the LORD [[H3068]] came upon [[H3847]] Gideon, [[H1439]] and he blew [[H8628]] the trumpet [[H7782]] and rallied [[H2199]] the Abiezrites [[H44]] behind him. [[H310]]

###### 35
Calling [[H2199]] them to arms, [[H310]] [Gideon] sent [[H7971]] messengers [[H4397]] throughout [[H3605]] Manasseh, [[H4519]] as well as [[H1571]] Asher, [[H836]] Zebulun, [[H2074]] and Naphtali, [[H5321]] so that they came up [[H5927]] to meet him. [[H7125]]

###### 36
Then Gideon [[H1439]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] God, [[H430]] “If [[H518]] You will deliver [[H3467]] Israel [[H3478]] by my hand, [[H3027]] as [[H834]] You have said, [[H1696]]

###### 37
then behold, [[H2009]] I [[H595]] will place [[H3322]] a fleece [[H1492]] of wool [[H6785]] on the threshing floor. [[H1637]] If [[H518]] there is [[H1961]] dew [[H2919]] only [[H905]] on [[H5921]] the fleece [[H1492]] and all [[H3605]] the ground [[H776]] is dry, [[H2721]] then I will know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] You will deliver [[H3467]] Israel [[H3478]] by my hand, [[H3027]] as [[H834]] You have said. [[H1696]]

###### 38
And that is what [[H3651]] happened. [[H1961]] When [Gideon] arose [[H7925]] the next morning, [[H4283]] he squeezed [[H2115]] the fleece [[H1492]] and wrung [[H4680]] out [[H4480]] the dew— [[H2919]] a bowlful [[H5602]] of water. [[H4325]]

###### 39
Then Gideon [[H1439]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] God, [[H430]] “Do not [[H408]] be angry [[H2734]] with me;  let me speak [[H1696]] one more time. [[H389]] Please allow me [[H4994]] one more [[H6471]] test [[H5254]] with the fleece. [[H1492]] This time [[H4994]] let it be [[H1961]] dry, [[H2721]] and the ground [[H776]] be [[H1961]] covered [[H3605]] with dew.” [[H2919]]

###### 40
And that [[H1931]] night [[H3915]] God [[H430]] did [[H6213]] so. [[H3651]] Only [[H905]] the fleece [[H1492]] was [[H1961]] dry, [[H2721]] and dew [[H2919]] covered [[H1961]] the ground. [[H776]]
