### 1
After the time [[H310]] of Abimelech, [[H40]] a man [[H376]] of Issachar, [[H3485]] Tola [[H8439]] son [[H1121]] of Puah, [[H6312]] the son [[H1121]] of Dodo, [[H1734]] rose [[H6965]] to deliver [[H3467]] Israel. [[H3478]] He lived [[H3427]] in Shamir, [[H8069]] in the hill country [[H2022]] of Ephraim. [[H669]]

### 2
Tola judged [[H8199]] Israel [[H3478]] twenty-three [[H6242]] years, [[H8141]] and when he died, [[H4191]] he was buried [[H6912]] in Shamir. [[H8069]]

### 3
After [Tola] [[H310]] arose [[H6965]] Jair [[H2971]] the Gileadite, [[H1569]] who judged [[H8199]] Israel [[H3478]] twenty-two [[H6242]] years. [[H8141]]

### 4
He had [[H1961]] thirty [[H7970]] sons [[H1121]] who rode [[H7392]] on [[H5921]] thirty [[H7970]] donkeys. [[H5895]] And they had [[H1992]] thirty [[H7970]] towns [[H5895]] in the land [[H776]] of Gilead, [[H1568]] which to [[H5704]] this [[H2088]] day [[H3117]] are called [[H7121]] Havvoth-jair. [[H2334]]

### 5
When Jair [[H2971]] died, [[H4191]] he was buried [[H6912]] in Kamon. [[H7056]]

### 6
And again [[H3254]] the Israelites [[H1121]] did [[H6213]] evil [[H7451]] in the sight [[H5869]] of the LORD. [[H3068]] They served [[H5647]] the Baals, [[H1168]] the Ashtoreths, [[H6252]] the gods [[H430]] of Aram, [[H758]] Sidon, [[H6721]] and [[H853]] Moab, [[H4124]] and [[H853]] the gods [[H430]] of the Ammonites [[H1121]] and Philistines. [[H6430]] Thus they forsook [[H5800]] the LORD [[H3068]] and did not [[H3808]] serve Him. [[H5647]]

### 7
So the anger [[H639]] of the LORD [[H3068]] burned [[H2734]] against Israel, [[H3478]] and He sold them [[H4376]] into the hands [[H3027]] of the Philistines [[H6430]] and Ammonites, [[H1121]]

### 8
who that very [[H1931]] year [[H8141]] harassed [[H7492]] and oppressed [[H7533]] the Israelites, [[H1121]] and did so for eighteen [[H8083]] years [[H8141]] to all [[H3605]] the Israelites [[H1121]] on the other side [[H5676]] of the Jordan [[H3383]] in Gilead, [[H1568]] the land [[H776]] of the Amorites. [[H567]]

### 9
The Ammonites [[H1121]] also [[H1571]] crossed [[H5674]] the Jordan [[H3383]] to fight [[H3898]] against Judah, [[H3063]] Benjamin, [[H1144]] and the house [[H1004]] of Ephraim, [[H669]] and Israel [[H3478]] was in severe [[H3966]] distress. [[H3334]]

### 10
Then the Israelites [[H1121]] cried out [[H2199]] to [[H413]] the LORD, [[H3068]] saying, [[H559]] “We have sinned [[H2398]] against You,  for we have indeed [[H3588]] forsaken [[H5800]] our God [[H430]] and served [[H5647]] the Baals.” [[H1168]]

### 11
The LORD [[H3068]] replied, [[H559]] “When the Egyptians, [[H4714]] Amorites, [[H567]] Ammonites, [[H1121]] Philistines, [[H6430]]

### 12
Sidonians, [[H6722]] Amalekites, [[H6002]] and Maonites [[H4584]] oppressed you [[H3905]] and you cried out [[H6817]] to Me, [[H413]] did I not deliver [[H3467]] you [[H853]] from their hands? [[H3027]]

### 13
But you [[H859]] have forsaken [[H5800]] Me [[H853]] and served [[H5647]] other [[H312]] gods, [[H430]] so [[H3651]] I will no [[H3808]] longer [[H3254]] deliver [[H3467]] you. [[H853]]

### 14
Go [[H1980]] and cry out [[H2199]] to [[H413]] the gods [[H430]] you have chosen. [[H977]] Let them [[H1992]] deliver [[H3467]] you  in your time [[H6256]] of distress.” [[H6869]]

### 15
“We have sinned,” [[H2398]] the Israelites [[H1121]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] the LORD. [[H3068]] “Deal [[H6213]] with us  as You see [[H5869]] fit; [[H2896]] but [[H389]] please [[H4994]] deliver us today!” [[H5337]]

### 16
So they put away [[H5493]] the foreign [[H5236]] gods [[H430]] from among them [[H7130]] and served [[H5647]] the LORD, [[H3068]] and He [[H5315]] could no longer bear [[H7114]] the misery [[H5999]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

### 17
Then the Ammonites [[H1121]] were called to arms [[H6817]] and camped [[H2583]] in Gilead, [[H1568]] and the Israelites [[H1121]] assembled [[H622]] and camped [[H2583]] at Mizpah. [[H4709]]

### 18
The rulers [[H8269]] of Gilead [[H1568]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] one [[H376]] another, [[H7453]] “Whoever [[H4310]] will launch [[H2490]] the attack [[H3898]] against the Ammonites [[H1121]] will be [[H1961]] the head [[H7218]] of all [[H3605]] who live [[H3427]] in Gilead.” [[H1568]]
