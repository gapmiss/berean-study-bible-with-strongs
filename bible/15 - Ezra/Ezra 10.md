### 1
While Ezra [[H5830]] prayed [[H6419]] and confessed, [[H3034]] weeping [[H1058]] and falling facedown [[H5307]] before [[H6440]] the house [[H1004]] of God, [[H430]] a very [[H3966]] large [[H7227]] assembly [[H6951]] of Israelites— [[H3478]] men, [[H582]] women, [[H802]] and children— [[H3206]] gathered [[H6908]] around him, [[H413]] and the people [[H5971]] wept bitterly [[H1058]] as well. [[H3588]]

### 2
Then Shecaniah [[H7935]] son [[H1121]] of Jehiel, [[H3171]] an Elamite, [[H1121]] said [[H6030]] to Ezra: [[H5830]] “We [[H587]] have been unfaithful [[H4603]] to our God [[H430]] by marrying [[H3427]] foreign [[H5237]] women [[H802]] from the people [[H5971]] of the land, [[H776]] yet [[H6258]] in spite of [[H5921]] this, [[H2063]] there is [[H3426]] hope [[H4723]] for Israel. [[H3478]]

### 3
So now [[H6258]] let us make [[H3772]] a covenant [[H1285]] before our God [[H430]] to send away [[H3318]] all [[H3605]] the foreign wives [[H802]] and their children, [[H3205]] according to the counsel [[H6098]] of my lord [[H113]] and of those who tremble [[H2730]] at the command [[H4687]] of our God. [[H430]] Let it be done [[H6213]] according to the Law. [[H8451]]

### 4
Get up, [[H6965]] for [[H3588]] [this] matter [is] [[H1697]] your [responsibility], [[H5921]] and we [[H587]] will support you. [[H5973]] Be strong [[H2388]] and take action!” [[H6213]]

### 5
So Ezra [[H5830]] got up [[H6965]] and made the leading [[H8269]] priests, [[H3548]] Levites, [[H3881]] and all [[H3605]] Israel [[H3478]] take an oath [[H7650]] to do what had been said. [[H6213]] And they took the oath. [[H7650]]

### 6
Then Ezra [[H5830]] withdrew [[H6965]] from before [[H6440]] the house [[H1004]] of God [[H430]] and walked [[H1980]] to [[H413]] the chamber [[H3957]] of Jehohanan [[H3076]] son [[H1121]] of Eliashib. [[H475]] And while he stayed [[H1980]] there, [[H8033]] he ate [[H398]] no [[H3808]] food [[H3899]] and drank [[H8354]] no [[H3808]] water, [[H4325]] because [[H3588]] he was mourning [[H56]] over [[H5921]] the unfaithfulness [[H4604]] of the exiles. [[H1473]]

### 7
And a proclamation [[H6963]] was issued [[H5674]] throughout Judah [[H3063]] and Jerusalem [[H3389]] that all [[H3605]] the exiles [[H1121]] should gather [[H6908]] at Jerusalem. [[H3389]]

### 8
Whoever [[H3605]] failed [[H3808]] to appear [[H935]] within three [[H7969]] days [[H3117]] would forfeit [[H2763]] all [[H3605]] his property, [[H7399]] according to the counsel [[H6098]] of the leaders [[H8269]] and elders, [[H2205]] and would himself be expelled [[H914]] from the assembly [[H6951]] of the exiles. [[H1473]]

### 9
So within the three [[H7969]] days, [[H3117]] all [[H3605]] the men [[H376]] of Judah [[H3063]] and Benjamin [[H1144]] assembled [[H6908]] in Jerusalem, [[H3389]] and on the twentieth day [[H6242]] of the ninth [[H8671]] month, [[H2320]] all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] sat [[H3427]] in the square [[H7339]] at the house [[H1004]] of God, [[H430]] trembling [[H7460]] regarding [[H5921]] this matter [[H1697]] and because of the heavy rain. [[H1653]]

### 10
Then Ezra [[H5830]] the priest [[H3548]] stood up [[H6965]] and said [[H559]] to them, [[H413]] “You [[H859]] have been unfaithful [[H4603]] by marrying [[H3427]] foreign [[H5237]] women, [[H802]] adding [[H3254]] to [[H5921]] the guilt [[H819]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

### 11
Now, therefore, [[H6258]] make [[H5414]] a confession [[H8426]] to the LORD, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of your fathers, [[H1]] and do [[H6213]] His will. [[H7522]] Separate [[H914]] yourselves [[H4480]] from the people [[H5971]] of the land [[H776]] and from your foreign [[H5237]] wives.” [[H802]]

### 12
And the whole [[H3605]] assembly [[H6951]] responded [[H6030]] in a loud [[H1419]] voice: [[H6963]] “Truly [[H3651]] we will do [[H6213]] as you say! [[H1697]]

### 13
But [[H61]] there are many [[H7227]] people here, [[H5971]] and it is the rainy [[H1653]] season. [[H6256]] We are not [[H369]] able [[H3581]] to stay [[H5975]] out in the open. [[H2351]] Nor [is this] [[H3808]] the work [[H4399]] of one [[H259]] or [[H3808]] two [[H8147]] days, [[H3117]] for [[H3588]] we have transgressed [[H6586]] greatly [[H7235]] in this [[H2088]] matter. [[H1697]]

### 14
Let our leaders [[H8269]] represent [[H5975]] the whole [[H3605]] assembly. [[H6951]] Then let everyone [[H3605]] in our towns [[H5892]] who has married [[H3427]] a foreign [[H5237]] woman [[H802]] come [[H935]] at an appointed [[H2163]] time, [[H6256]] together with [[H5973]] the elders [[H2205]] and judges [[H8199]] of each town, [[H5892]] until the fierce anger [[H2740]] of our God [[H430]] in this [[H2088]] matter [[H1697]] is turned away [[H7725]] from us. [[H4480]]

### 15
(Only [[H389]] Jonathan [[H3129]] son [[H1121]] of Asahel [[H6214]] and Jahzeiah [[H3167]] son [[H1121]] of Tikvah, [[H8616]] supported [[H5826]] by Meshullam [[H4918]] and Shabbethai [[H7678]] the Levite, [[H3881]] opposed [[H5975]] this [plan].) [[H2063]]

### 16
So the exiles [[H1121]] did [[H6213]] as proposed. [[H3651]] Ezra [[H5830]] the priest [[H3548]] selected [[H914]] men [[H376]] who were family [[H1]] heads, [[H7218]] each of them [[H3605]] identified by name, [[H8034]] to represent their families. [[H1]] On the first [[H259]] day [[H3117]] of the tenth [[H6224]] month [[H2320]] they convened [[H1875]] the investigation, [[H1697]]

### 17
and by [[H5704]] the first [[H259]] day [[H3117]] of the first [[H7223]] month [[H2320]] they had dealt [[H3615]] with all [[H3605]] the men [[H376]] who had married [[H3427]] foreign [[H5237]] women. [[H802]]

### 18

[[H1436]]

### 19
They pledged [[H5414]] to send their wives [[H802]] away, [[H3318]] and for their guilt [[H818]] [they presented] a ram [[H352]] from the flock [[H6629]] as [[H5921]] a guilt offering. [[H819]]
