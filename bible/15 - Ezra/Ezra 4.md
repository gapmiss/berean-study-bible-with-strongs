###### 1
When the enemies [[H6862]] of Judah [[H3063]] and Benjamin [[H1144]] heard [[H8085]] that [[H3588]] the exiles [[H1121]] were building [[H1129]] a temple [[H1964]] for the LORD, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]]

###### 2
they approached [[H5066]] Zerubbabel [[H2216]] and the heads [[H7218]] of the families, [[H1]] saying, [[H559]] “Let us build [[H1129]] with you [[H5973]] because, [[H3588]] like you,  we seek [[H1875]] your God [[H430]] and have been sacrificing [[H2076]] to Him since [[H3808]] the time [[H3117]] of  King [[H4428]] Esar-haddon [[H634]] of Assyria, [[H804]] who brought [[H5927]] us [[H853]] here. [[H6311]]

###### 3
But Zerubbabel, [[H2216]] Jeshua, [[H3442]] and the other [[H7605]] heads [[H7218]] of the families [[H1]] of Israel [[H3478]] replied, [[H559]] “You have no [[H3808]] part with us  in building [[H1129]] a house [[H1004]] for our God, [[H430]] since [[H3588]] we [[H587]] alone [[H3162]] must build [[H1129]] it for the LORD, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] as [[H834]] Cyrus [[H3566]] the king [[H4428]] of Persia [[H6539]] has commanded us. [[H6680]]

###### 4
Then [[H1961]] the people [[H5971]] of the land [[H776]] set out to discourage [[H7503]] the people [[H5971]] of Judah [[H3063]] and make them afraid [[H1086]] to build. [[H1129]]

###### 5
They hired [[H7936]] counselors [[H3289]] against them [[H5921]] to frustrate [[H6565]] their plans [[H6098]] throughout [[H3605]] the reign [[H3117]] of Cyrus [[H3566]] king [[H4428]] of Persia [[H6539]] and down to [[H5704]] the reign [[H4438]] of Darius [[H1867]] king [[H4428]] of Persia. [[H6539]]

###### 6
At the beginning [[H8462]] of the reign [[H4438]] of Xerxes, [[H325]] an accusation [[H7855]] was lodged [[H3789]] against [[H5921]] the people [[H3427]] of Judah [[H3063]] and Jerusalem. [[H3389]]

###### 7
And in the days [[H3117]] of Artaxerxes king [[H783]] of Persia, [[H6539]] Bishlam, [[H1312]] Mithredath, [[H4990]] Tabeel, [[H2870]] and the rest [[H7605]] of  his associates [[H3674]] wrote [a letter] [[H3789]] to [[H5921]] Artaxerxes. [[H783]] [It] [[H5406]] was written [[H3789]] in Aramaic [[H762]] and translated [for the king]. [[H8638]] The Aramaic script [read as follows]: [[H762]]

###### 8
Rehum [[H7348]] the commander [[H1169]] and Shimshai [[H8124]] the scribe [[H5613]] wrote [[H3790]] a [[H2298]] letter [[H104]] against [[H5922]] Jerusalem [[H3390]] to King [[H4430]] Artaxerxes [[H783]] as follows: [[H3660]]

###### 9
From Rehum [[H7348]] the commander, [[H1169]] Shimshai [[H8124]] the scribe, [[H5613]] and the rest [[H7606]] of their associates— [[H3675]] the judges [[H1784]] and officials [[H671]] over Tripolis, [[H2967]] Persia, [[H670]] Erech [[H756]] and Babylon, [[H896]] the Elamites [[H5962]] of Susa, [[H7801]]

###### 10
and the rest [[H7606]] of the peoples [[H524]] whom [[H1768]] the great [[H7229]] and honorable [[H3358]] Ashurbanipal [[H620]] relocated [[H1541]] and settled [[H3488]] in the cities [[H7149]] of [[H1768]] Samaria [[H8115]] and [[H7606]] elsewhere west [[H5675]] of the Euphrates. [[H5103]]

###### 11
(This [[H1836]] is the text [[H6573]] of the letter [[H104]] they sent [[H7972]] to him.) [[H5922]] To [[H5922]] King [[H4430]] Artaxerxes, [[H783]] From your servants, [[H5649]] the men [[H606]] west [[H5675]] of the Euphrates: [[H5103]]

###### 12
Let it be [[H1934]] known [[H3046]] to the king [[H4430]] that [[H1768]] the Jews [[H3062]] who [[H1768]] came [[H5559]] from [[H4481]] you [[H3890]] have returned [[H858]] to us [[H5922]] at Jerusalem. [[H3390]] And they are rebuilding [[H1124]] that rebellious [[H4779]] and wicked [[H873]] city, [[H7149]] restoring [[H3635]] its walls, [[H7792]] and repairing [[H2338]] its foundations. [[H787]]

###### 13
Let it now [[H3705]] be [[H1934]] known [[H3046]] to the king [[H4430]] that [[H1768]] if [[H2006]] that [[H1791]] city [[H7149]] is rebuilt [[H1124]] and its walls [[H7792]] are restored, [[H3635]] they will not [[H3809]] pay [[H5415]] tribute, [[H4061]] duty, [[H1093]] or toll, [[H1983]] and the royal [[H4430]] treasury [[H674]] will suffer. [[H5142]]

###### 14
Now [[H3705]] because [[H3606]] we are in the service [[H4415]] of the palace [[H1965]] and it is not fitting [[H749]] for us  to allow [[H2370]] the king [[H4430]] to be dishonored, [[H6173]] we have sent [[H7972]] to inform [[H3046]] the king [[H4430]]

###### 15
that [[H1768]] a search should be made [[H1240]] of the record [[H1799]] books [[H5609]] of [[H1768]] your fathers. [[H2]] [In these] [[H1799]] books [[H5609]] you will discover [[H7912]] and verify [[H3046]] that [[H1768]] the city [[H7149]] is a rebellious [[H4779]] city, [[H7149]] harmful [[H5142]] to kings [[H4430]] and provinces, [[H4083]] inciting [[H5648]] sedition [[H849]] from [[H4481]] ancient [[H5957]] times. [[H3118]] That is why [[H5922]] this [[H1791]] city [[H7149]] was destroyed. [[H2718]]

###### 16
We [[H586]] advise [[H3046]] the king [[H4430]] that [[H1768]] if [[H2006]] this [[H1791]] city [[H7149]] is rebuilt [[H1124]] and its walls [[H7792]] are restored, [[H3635]] you will have [[H383]] no [[H3809]] dominion [[H2508]] west [[H5675]] of the Euphrates. [[H5103]]

###### 17
[Then] the king [[H4430]] sent [[H7972]] this reply: [[H6600]] To [[H5922]] Rehum [[H7348]] the commander, [[H1169]] Shimshai [[H8124]] the scribe, [[H5613]] and the rest [[H7606]] of your associates [[H3675]] living [[H3488]] in Samaria [[H8115]] and elsewhere [[H7606]] in the region west [[H5675]] of the Euphrates: [[H5103]] Greetings. [[H8001]]

###### 18
The letter [[H5407]] you sent [[H7972]] us [[H5922]] has been translated [[H6568]] and read [[H7123]] in my presence. [[H6925]]

###### 19
I issued [[H7761]] a decree, [[H2942]] and a search was conducted. [[H1240]] It was discovered [[H7912]] that [[H1768]] this [[H1791]] city [[H7149]] has revolted [[H5376]] against [[H5922]] kings [[H4430]] from ancient [[H5957]] times, [[H3118]] engaging in rebellion [[H4776]] and sedition. [[H849]]

###### 20
And mighty [[H8624]] kings [[H4430]] have ruled over [[H5922]] Jerusalem [[H3390]] and exercised authority [[H7990]] over the whole [[H3606]] region west [[H5675]] of the Euphrates, [[H5103]] and tribute, [[H4061]] duty, [[H1093]] and toll [[H1983]] were paid [[H3052]] to them. 

###### 21
Now, therefore, [[H3705]] issue [[H7761]] an order [[H2942]] for these [[H479]] men [[H1400]] to stop, [[H989]] so that this [[H1791]] city [[H7149]] will not [[H3809]] be rebuilt [[H1124]] until [[H5705]] I [[H4481]] so order. [[H2941]]

###### 22
See that you [[H2095]] do not neglect [[H7960]] this matter. [[H1836]] Why [[H4101]] allow this threat [[H2257]] to increase [[H7680]] and the royal [[H4430]] interests to suffer? [[H5142]]

###### 23
When [[H116]] the text [[H6573]] of the letter [[H5407]] from King [[H4430]] Artaxerxes [[H783]] was read [[H7123]] to [[H6925]] Rehum, [[H7348]] Shimshai [[H8124]] the scribe, [[H5613]] and their associates, [[H3675]] they went [[H236]] immediately [[H924]] to [[H5922]] the Jews [[H3062]] in Jerusalem [[H3390]] and forcibly [[H153]] stopped [[H989]] them. [[H1994]]

###### 24
Thus [[H116]] the construction [[H5673]] of the house [[H1005]] of God [[H426]] in Jerusalem [[H3390]] ceased, [[H989]] and it remained [[H1934]] at a standstill [[H989]] until [[H5705]] the second [[H8648]] year [[H8140]] of the reign [[H4437]] of King [[H4430]] Darius [[H1868]] of Persia.
