### 1
By the seventh [[H7637]] month, [[H2320]] the Israelites [[H1121]] had settled [[H5060]] in their towns, [[H5892]] and the people [[H5971]] assembled [[H622]] as one [[H259]] man [[H376]] in [[H413]] Jerusalem. [[H3389]]

### 2
Then Jeshua [[H3442]] son [[H1121]] of Jozadak [[H3136]] and his fellow [[H251]] priests, [[H3548]] along with Zerubbabel [[H2216]] son [[H1121]] of Shealtiel [[H7597]] and his associates, [[H251]] began [[H6965]] to build [[H1129]] the altar [[H4196]] of the God [[H430]] of Israel [[H3478]] to sacrifice [[H5927]] burnt offerings [[H5930]] on it, [[H5921]] as it is written [[H3789]] in the law [[H8451]] of Moses, [[H4872]] the man [[H376]] of God. [[H430]]

### 3
They set up [[H3559]] the altar [[H4196]] on [[H5921]] its foundation [[H4350]] and sacrificed [[H5927]] burnt offerings [[H5930]] upon it [[H5921]] to the LORD— [[H3068]] [both] the morning [[H1242]] and evening [[H6153]] burnt offerings— [[H5930]] even though [[H3588]] they feared [[H367]] the people [[H5971]] of the land. [[H776]]

### 4
They also celebrated [[H6213]] the Feast [[H2282]] of Tabernacles, [[H5521]] as [it is] written, [[H3789]] and offered burnt offerings [[H5930]] daily, [[H3117]] based on the number [[H4557]] prescribed [[H4941]] for each day. [[H3117]]

### 5
After that, [[H310]] they presented the regular [[H8548]] burnt offerings [[H5930]] and [those] for New Moons [[H2320]] and for all [[H3605]] the appointed [[H4150]] sacred feasts [[H6942]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] as well as all [[H3605]] the freewill offerings [[H5071]] brought [[H5068]] to the LORD. [[H3068]]

### 6
On the first [[H259]] day [[H3117]] of the seventh [[H7637]] month, [[H2320]] [the Israelites] began [[H2490]] to offer [[H5927]] burnt offerings [[H5930]] to the LORD, [[H3069]] {although the foundation} of the temple [[H1964]] of the LORD [[H3069]] had not been laid. [[H3245]]

### 7
They gave [[H5414]] money [[H3701]] to the masons [[H2672]] and carpenters, [[H2796]] and food [[H3978]] and drink [[H4960]] and oil [[H8081]] to the people of Sidon [[H6722]] and Tyre [[H6876]] to bring [[H935]] cedar [[H730]] logs [[H6086]] from [[H4480]] Lebanon [[H3844]] to [[H413]] Joppa [[H3305]] by sea, [[H3220]] as authorized [[H7558]] by King [[H4428]] Cyrus [[H3566]] of Persia. [[H6539]]

### 8
In the second [[H8145]] month [[H2320]] of the second [[H8145]] year [[H8141]] after they had arrived [[H935]] at [[H413]] the house [[H1004]] of God [[H430]] in Jerusalem, [[H3389]] Zerubbabel [[H2216]] son [[H1121]] of Shealtiel, [[H7597]] Jeshua [[H3442]] son [[H1121]] of Jozadak, [[H3136]] and the rest [[H7605]] of their associates [[H251]] including the priests, [[H3548]] the Levites, [[H3881]] and all [[H3605]] who had returned [[H935]] to Jerusalem [[H3389]] from the captivity, [[H7628]] began [the work]. [[H2490]] They appointed [[H5975]] Levites [[H3881]] twenty [[H6242]] years of age [[H1121]] or older [[H4605]] to supervise [[H5329]] the construction [[H4399]] of the house [[H1004]] of the LORD. [[H3068]]

### 9
Jeshua [[H3442]] and his sons [[H1121]] and brothers [[H251]] joined [[H5975]] together [[H259]] with Kadmiel [[H6934]] and his sons, [[H1121]] the descendants [[H1121]] of Yehudah, [[H3063]] [and with] the sons [[H1121]] of Henadad [[H2582]] and their sons [[H1121]] and brothers— [[H251]] all Levites— [[H3881]] to supervise [[H5329]] those working [[H6213]] on the house [[H1004]] of God. [[H430]]

### 10
When the builders [[H1129]] had laid the foundation [[H3245]] of the temple [[H1964]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] the priests [[H3548]] in their apparel [[H3847]] with trumpets, [[H2689]] and the Levites [[H3881]] (the sons [[H1121]] of Asaph) [[H623]] with cymbals, [[H4700]] took their positions [[H5975]] to praise [[H1984]] the LORD, [[H3068]] as [[H5921]] King [[H4428]] David [[H1732]] of Israel [[H3478]] had prescribed. [[H3027]]

### 11
And they sang responsively [[H6030]] with praise [[H1984]] and thanksgiving [[H3034]] to the LORD: [[H3068]] “For [[H3588]] He is good; [[H2896]] for [[H3588]] His loving devotion [[H2617]] upon [[H5921]] Israel [[H3478]] endures forever.” [[H5769]] Then all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] gave a great [[H1419]] shout [[H7321]] of praise [[H1984]] to the LORD, [[H3068]] because {the foundation} [[H5921]] of the house [[H1004]] of the LORD [[H3068]] had been laid. [[H3245]]

### 12
But many [[H7227]] of the older [[H2205]] priests, [[H3548]] Levites, [[H3881]] and family [[H1]] heads [[H7218]] who [[H834]] had seen [[H7200]] the first [[H7223]] temple [[H1004]] wept [[H1058]] loudly [[H6963]] when they saw [[H5869]] the foundation [[H3245]] of this [[H2088]] temple. [[H1004]] Still, many [[H7227]] others shouted [[H8643]] joyfully. [[H6963]]

### 13
The people [[H5971]] could not [[H369]] distinguish [[H5234]] the shouts [[H8643]] of joy [[H8057]] from the sound [[H6963]] of weeping, [[H1065]] because [[H3588]] the people [[H5971]] were making so much noise. [[H7321]] And the sound [[H6963]] was heard [[H8085]] from [[H5704]] afar. [[H7350]]
