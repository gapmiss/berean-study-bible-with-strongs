In the first [[H259]] year [[H8141]] of Cyrus [[H3566]] king [[H4428]] of Persia, [[H6539]] to fulfill [[H3615]] the word [[H1697]] of the LORD [[H3068]] spoken [[H6310]] through Jeremiah, [[H3414]] the LORD [[H3068]] stirred [[H5782]] the spirit [[H7307]] of Cyrus [[H3566]] king [[H4428]] of Persia [[H6539]] to send [[H5674]] a proclamation [[H6963]] throughout [[H3605]] his kingdom [[H4438]] and to put it in writing [[H4385]] as follows: [[H559]]

###### 2
“This is what [[H3541]] Cyrus [[H3566]] king [[H4428]] of Persia [[H6539]] says: [[H559]] ‘The LORD, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of heaven, [[H8064]] who [[H1931]] has given [[H5414]] me  all [[H3605]] the kingdoms [[H4467]] of the earth, [[H776]] has appointed [[H6485]] me [[H5921]] to build [[H1129]] a house [[H1004]] for Him  at Jerusalem [[H3389]] in Judah. [[H3063]]

###### 3
Whoever [[H4310]] among you  belongs to [[H3605]] His people, [[H5971]] may his God [[H430]] be [[H1961]] with him, [[H5973]] and may he go [[H5927]] to Jerusalem [[H3389]] in Judah [[H3063]] and build [[H1129]] the house [[H1004]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of Israel; [[H3478]] He [is] [[H1931]] the God [[H430]] who [[H834]] is in Jerusalem. [[H3389]]

###### 4
And let every [[H3605]] survivor, [[H7604]] wherever [[H3605]] he [[H1931]] lives, [[H1481]] be assisted [[H5375]] by the men [[H376]] of that region [[H4725]] with silver, [[H3701]] gold, [[H2091]] goods, [[H7399]] and livestock, [[H929]] along with [[H5973]] a freewill offering [[H5071]] for the house [[H1004]] of God [[H430]] in Jerusalem.’” [[H3389]]

###### 5
So the family [[H1]] heads [[H7218]] of Judah [[H3063]] and Benjamin, [[H1144]] along with the priests [[H3548]] and Levites— [[H3881]] everyone [[H3605]] whose spirit [[H7307]] God [[H430]] had stirred— [[H5782]] prepared [[H6965]] to go up [[H5927]] and rebuild [[H1129]] the house [[H1004]] of the LORD [[H3068]] in Jerusalem. [[H3389]]

###### 6
And all [[H3605]] their neighbors [[H5439]] supported [[H2388]] them [[H3027]] with articles [[H3627]] of silver [[H3701]] and gold, [[H2091]] with goods [[H7399]] and livestock, [[H929]] and with valuables, [[H4030]] in addition [[H905]] to [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] their freewill offerings. [[H5068]]

###### 7
King [[H4428]] Cyrus [[H3566]] also brought out [[H3318]] the articles [[H3627]] belonging to the house [[H1004]] of the LORD [[H3069]] that [[H834]] Nebuchadnezzar [[H5019]] had carried away [[H3318]] from Jerusalem [[H3389]] and placed [[H5414]] in the temple [[H1004]] of his gods. [[H430]]

###### 8
Cyrus [[H3566]] king [[H4428]] of Persia [[H6539]] had them brought out [[H3318]] by [[H5921]] the hand [[H3027]] of Mithredath [[H4990]] the treasurer, [[H1489]] who counted them out [[H5608]] to Sheshbazzar [[H8339]] the prince [[H5387]] of Judah. [[H3063]]
