### 10
from the descendants [of Bani], [[H1121]] Shelomith [[H8019]] son [[H1121]] of Josiphiah, [[H3131]] and with him [[H5973]] 160 [[H3967]] men; [[H2145]]

### 11
from the descendants [[H1121]] of Bebai, [[H893]] Zechariah [[H2148]] son [[H1121]] of Bebai, [[H893]] and with him [[H5973]] 28 [[H6242]] men; [[H2145]]

### 12
from the descendants [[H1121]] of Azgad, [[H5803]] Johanan [[H3110]] son [[H1121]] of Hakkatan, [[H6997]] and with him [[H5973]] 110 [[H3967]] men; [[H2145]]

### 13
from the later [[H314]] descendants [[H1121]] of Adonikam, [[H140]] these [[H428]] [were] their names: [[H8034]] Eliphelet, [[H467]] Jeiel, [[H3273]] and Shemaiah, [[H8098]] and with them [[H5973]] 60 [[H8346]] men; [[H2145]]

### 14
and from the descendants [[H1121]] of Bigvai, [[H902]] Uthai, [[H5793]] and Zaccur, [[H2072]] and with them [[H5973]] 70 [[H7657]] men. [[H2145]]

### 15
Now I assembled [these exiles] [[H6908]] at [[H413]] the canal [[H5104]] that flows [[H935]] to [[H413]] Ahava, [[H163]] and we camped [[H2583]] there [[H8033]] three [[H7969]] days. [[H3117]] And when I searched [[H995]] among the people [[H5971]] and priests, [[H3548]] I found [[H4672]] no [[H3808]] Levites [[H1121]] there. [[H8033]]

### 16
Then I summoned [[H7971]] the leaders: [[H7218]] Eliezer, [[H461]] Ariel, [[H740]] Shemaiah, [[H8098]] Elnathan, [[H494]] Jarib, [[H3402]] Elnathan, [[H494]] Nathan, [[H5416]] Zechariah, [[H2148]] and Meshullam, [[H4918]] as well as the teachers [[H995]] Joiarib [[H3114]] and Elnathan. [[H494]]

### 17
And  I sent [[H3318]] them [[H853]] to [[H5921]] Iddo, [[H112]] the leader [[H7218]] at Casiphia, [[H3703]] with a message [[H1697]] for [[H413]] him [[H112]] and his kinsmen, [[H251]] the temple servants [[H5411]] at Casiphia, [[H3703]] that they should bring [[H935]] to us  ministers [[H8334]] for the house [[H1004]] of our God. [[H430]]

### 18
And since the gracious [[H2896]] hand [[H3027]] of our God [[H430]] was upon us, [[H5921]] they brought [[H935]] us  Sherebiah— [[H8274]] a man [[H376]] of insight [[H7922]] from the descendants [[H1121]] of Mahli [[H4249]] son [[H1121]] of Levi, [[H3878]] the son [[H1121]] of Israel— [[H3478]] along with his sons [[H1121]] and brothers, [[H251]] 18 [[H8083]] men; [[H6240]]

### 19
also [[H853]] Hashabiah, [[H2811]] together with [[H854]] Jeshaiah, [[H3470]] from the descendants [[H1121]] of Merari, [[H4847]] and his brothers [[H251]] and their sons, [[H1121]] 20 men. [[H6242]]

### 20
[They also brought] 220 [[H3967]] of [[H4480]] the temple servants. [[H5411]] (David [[H1732]] and the officials [[H8269]] had appointed [[H5414]] the temple servants [[H5411]] to assist [[H5656]] the Levites.) [[H3881]] All of them [[H3605]] were designated [[H5344]] by name. [[H8034]]

### 21
And there by [[H5921]] the Ahava [[H163]] Canal, [[H5104]] I proclaimed [[H7121]] a fast, [[H6685]] so that we might humble [[H6031]] ourselves before [[H6440]] our God [[H430]] and ask Him for [[H1245]] a safe [[H3477]] journey for us [[H1870]] and our children, [[H2945]] with all [[H3605]] our possessions. [[H7399]]

### 22
For [[H3588]] I was ashamed [[H954]] to ask the king [[H4428]] for [[H7592]] an [escort of] soldiers [[H2428]] and horsemen [[H6571]] to protect [[H5826]] us from [[H4480]] our enemies [[H341]] on the road, [[H1870]] since [[H3588]] we had told him, [[H559]] “The hand [[H3027]] of our God [[H430]] is gracious [[H2896]] to [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] who seek Him, [[H1245]] but His great [[H5797]] anger [[H639]] is against [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] who forsake Him. [[H5800]]

### 23
So we fasted [[H6684]] and petitioned [[H1245]] our God [[H430]] about [[H5921]] this, [[H2063]] and He granted our request. [[H6279]]

### 24
Then I set apart [[H914]] twelve [[H8147]] of the leading [[H8269]] priests, [[H3548]] together with Sherebiah, [[H8274]] Hashabiah, [[H2811]] and [[H5973]] ten [[H6235]] of their brothers, [[H251]]

### 25
and  I weighed out [[H8254]] to them [[H1992]] the contribution [[H8641]] of silver [[H3701]] and [[H853]] gold [[H2091]] and [[H853]] the articles [[H3627]] that the king, [[H4428]] his counselors, [[H3289]] his leaders, [[H8269]] and all [[H3605]] the Israelites [[H3478]] there [[H4672]] had offered [[H7311]] for the house [[H1004]] of our God. [[H430]]

### 26
I weighed out [[H8254]] into [[H5921]] their hands [[H3027]] 650 [[H8337]] talents [[H3603]] of silver, [[H3701]] silver [[H3701]] articles [[H3627]] [weighing] 100 [[H3967]] talents, [[H3603]] 100 [[H3967]] talents [[H3603]] of gold, [[H2091]]

### 27
20 [[H6242]] gold [[H2091]] bowls [[H3713]] worth 1,000 [[H505]] darics, [[H150]] and two [[H8147]] articles [[H3627]] of fine [[H2896]] polished [[H6668]] bronze, [[H5178]] as precious as gold. [[H2091]]

### 28
Then I told [[H559]] them, [[H413]] “You [[H859]] are holy [[H6944]] to the LORD, [[H3068]] and these articles [are] [[H3627]] holy. [[H6944]] The silver [[H3701]] and gold [[H2091]] are a freewill offering [[H5071]] to the LORD, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of your fathers. [[H1]]

### 29
Guard [[H8245]] them carefully [[H8104]] until [[H5704]] you weigh them out [[H8254]] in the chambers [[H3957]] of the house [[H1004]] of the LORD [[H3068]] in Jerusalem [[H3389]] before [[H6440]] the leading [[H8269]] priests, [[H3548]] Levites, [[H3881]] and heads [[H8269]] of the Israelite [[H3478]] families.” [[H1]]

### 30
So the priests [[H3548]] and Levites [[H3881]] took charge of [[H6901]] the silver [[H3701]] and gold [[H2091]] and sacred articles [[H3627]] that had been weighed out [[H4948]] to be taken [[H935]] to the house [[H1004]] of our God [[H430]] in Jerusalem. [[H3389]]

### 31
On the twelfth [[H8147]] day of the first [[H7223]] month, [[H2320]] we set out [[H5265]] from the Ahava [[H163]] Canal [[H5104]] to go [[H1980]] to Jerusalem, [[H3389]] and the hand [[H3027]] of our God [[H430]] was [[H1961]] upon us [[H5921]] to protect us [[H5337]] from the hands [[H3709]] of the enemies [[H341]] and bandits [[H693]] along [[H5921]] the way. [[H1870]]

### 32
So we arrived [[H935]] at Jerusalem [[H3389]] and rested [[H3427]] there [[H8033]] for three [[H7969]] days. [[H3117]]

### 33
On the fourth [[H7243]] day, [[H3117]] in the house [[H1004]] of our God, [[H430]] we weighed out [[H8254]] the silver [[H3701]] and gold [[H2091]] and sacred articles [[H3627]] into [[H5921]] the hand [[H3027]] of Meremoth [[H4822]] son [[H1121]] of Uriah, [[H223]] the priest. [[H3548]] Eleazar [[H499]] son [[H1121]] of Phinehas [[H6372]] was with him, [[H5973]] along with [[H5973]] the Levites [[H3881]] Jozabad [[H3107]] son [[H1121]] of Jeshua [[H3442]] and Noadiah [[H5129]] son [[H1121]] of Binnui. [[H1131]]

### 34
Everything [[H3605]] was verified by number [[H4557]] and weight, [[H4948]] and the total [[H3605]] weight [[H4948]] was recorded [[H3789]] at that [[H1931]] time. [[H6256]]

### 35
Then the exiles [[H1121]] who had returned [[H935]] from captivity [[H7628]] sacrificed [[H7126]] burnt offerings [[H5930]] to the God [[H430]] of Israel: [[H3478]] 12 [[H8147]] bulls [[H6499]] for [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] Israel, [[H3478]] 96 [[H8673]] rams, [[H352]] 77 [[H7657]] lambs, [[H3532]] and a sin offering [[H2403]] of 12 [[H8147]] male goats. [[H6842]] All [this was] [[H3605]] a burnt offering [[H5930]] to the LORD. [[H3068]]

### 36
They also delivered [[H5414]] the king’s [[H4428]] edicts [[H1881]] to the royal [[H4428]] satraps [[H323]] and governors [[H6346]] of the region west [[H5676]] of the Euphrates, [[H5104]] who proceeded to assist [[H5375]] the people [[H5971]] and the house [[H1004]] of God. [[H430]]
