### 1
Now [[G1161]] faith [[G4102]] is [[G1510]] [the] assurance [[G5287]] of what [we] hope for [[G1679]] [and the] certainty [[G1650]] of what [[G4229]] we do not see. [[G991]]

### 2
This is why [[G3778]] the [[G3588]] ancients [[G4245]] were commended. [[G3140]]

### 3
By faith [[G4102]] we understand that [[G3539]] the [[G3588]] universe [[G165]] was formed [[G2675]] by God’s command, [[G4487]] so that [[G1519]] what [[G3588]] is seen [[G991]] was not made [[G1096]] out of [[G1537]] what [[G3588]] was visible. [[G5316]]

### 4
By faith [[G4102]] Abel [[G6]] offered [[G4374]] God [[G2316]] a better [[G4119]] sacrifice [[G2378]] than [[G3844]] Cain [did]. [[G2535]] By [[G1223]] [faith] [[G3739]] he was commended [[G3140]] as [[G1510]] righteous [[G1342]] [when] God [[G2316]] gave approval [[G3140]] to [[G1909]] his [[G846]] gifts. [[G1435]] And [[G2532]] by [[G1223]] [faith] [[G846]] he still speaks, [[G2980]] [even though] he is dead. [[G599]]

### 5
By faith [[G4102]] Enoch [[G1802]] was taken up [[G3346]] [so that] [[G3588]] he did not see [[G3708]] death. [[G2288]] He could not be found, [[G2147]] because [[G1360]] God [[G2316]] had taken him away. [[G3346]] For [[G1063]] before [[G4253]] he was taken, [[G3331]] he was commended as [[G3140]] one who pleased [[G2100]] God. [[G2316]]

### 6
And [[G1161]] without [[G5565]] faith [[G4102]] [it is] impossible [[G102]] to please [God], [[G2100]] because [[G1063]] anyone who [[G3588]] approaches [[G4334]] [Him] [[G2316]] must [[G1163]] believe [[G4100]] that [[G3754]] He exists [[G1510]] and [that] [[G2532]] He rewards [[G3406]] those who [[G3588]] earnestly seek [[G1567]] Him. [[G846]]

### 7
By faith [[G4102]] Noah, [[G3575]] when warned [[G5537]] about [[G4012]] things [[G3588]] not yet [[G3369]] seen, [[G991]] in godly fear [[G2125]] built [[G2680]] an ark [[G2787]] to [[G1519]] save [[G4991]] his [[G846]] family. [[G3624]] By [[G1223]] [faith] [[G3739]] he condemned [[G2632]] the [[G3588]] world [[G2889]] and [[G2532]] became [[G1096]] heir [[G2818]] of the [[G3588]] righteousness [that] [[G1343]] comes by [[G2596]] faith. [[G4102]]

### 8
By faith [[G4102]] Abraham, [[G11]] when called [[G2564]] to go [[G1831]] to [[G1519]] a place [[G5117]] he would later [[G3195]] receive [[G2983]] as [[G1519]] [his] inheritance, [[G2817]] obeyed [[G5219]] and [[G2532]] went, [[G1831]] without [[G3361]] knowing [[G1987]] where [[G4226]] he was going. [[G2064]]

### 9
By faith [[G4102]] he dwelt [[G3939]] in [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] promised [[G1860]] land [[G1093]] as {a stranger} [[G5613]] in a foreign [country]. [[G245]] He lived [[G2730]] in [[G1722]] tents, [[G4633]] as did [[G3326]] Isaac [[G2464]] and [[G2532]] Jacob, [[G2384]] who [were] [[G3588]] heirs with him [[G4789]] of the [[G3588]] same [[G846]] promise. [[G1860]]

### 10
For [[G1063]] he was looking forward to [[G1551]] the [[G3588]] city [[G4172]] with [[G2192]] foundations, [[G2310]] whose [[G3739]] architect [[G5079]] and [[G2532]] builder [is] [[G1217]] God. [[G2316]]

### 11
By faith [[G4102]] Sarah, [[G4564]] even though [[G2532]] she [[G846]] was barren [[G4723]] and [[G2532]] beyond [[G3844]] the opportune [[G2540]] age, [[G2244]] was enabled [[G2983]] to [[G1519]] conceive [[G2602]] a child, [[G4690]] because [[G1893]] she considered [[G2233]] Him [[G3588]] faithful [[G4103]] who had promised. [[G1861]]

### 12
And [[G2532]] so [[G1352]] from [[G575]] one man, [[G1520]] and [[G2532]] he [[G3778]] as good as dead, [[G3499]] came descendants [[G1080]] as [[G2531]] numerous [[G4128]] as the [[G3588]] stars [[G798]] in the [[G3588]] sky [[G3772]] and [[G2532]] as countless [[G382]] as [[G5613]] the [[G3588]] sand [[G285]] on [[G3844]] the [[G3588]] seashore. [[G5491]]

### 13
All [[G3956]] these [people] [[G3778]] died [[G599]] in [[G2596]] faith, [[G4102]] without [[G3361]] having received [[G2983]] the things [[G3588]] they were promised. [[G1860]] However, [[G235]] they saw [them] [[G3708]] and [[G2532]] welcomed [[G782]] them [[G846]] from afar. [[G4207]] And [[G2532]] they acknowledged [[G3670]] that [[G3754]] they were [[G1510]] strangers [[G3581]] and [[G2532]] exiles [[G3927]] on [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] earth. [[G1093]]

### 14
Now [[G1063]] those who [[G3588]] say [[G3004]] such things [[G5108]] show [[G1718]] that [[G3754]] they are seeking [[G1934]] a country of their own. [[G3968]]

### 15
If [[G1487]] they had been thinking of [[G3421]] [the country] [[G3739]] they had left, [[G1545]] they would have had [[G2192]] opportunity [[G2540]] to return. [[G344]]

### 16
Instead, [[G1161]] they were longing for [[G3713]] a better [country], [[G2909]] a heavenly [one]. [[G2032]] Therefore [[G1352]] God [[G2316]] is not ashamed [[G1870]] to be called [[G1941]] their [[G846]] God, [[G2316]] for [[G1063]] He has prepared [[G2090]] a city [[G4172]] for them. [[G846]]

### 17
By faith [[G4102]] Abraham, [[G11]] when he was tested, [[G3985]] offered up [[G4374]] Isaac [ on the altar ]. [[G2464]] He who [[G3588]] had received [[G324]] the [[G3588]] promises [[G1860]] was ready to offer [[G4374]] [his] [[G3588]] one and only son, [[G3439]]

### 18
even though [[G4314]] [God] had said [[G2980]] to him, [[G3739]] “Through [[G1722]] Isaac [[G2464]] your [[G4771]] offspring [[G4690]] will be reckoned.” [[G2564]]

### 19
[Abraham] reasoned [[G3049]] that [[G3754]] God [[G2316]] could [[G1415]] raise [[G1453]] [the] dead, [[G3498]] [and] in [[G1722]] a sense, [[G3850]] he did receive [[G2865]] [Isaac] [[G846]] back [[G2532]] from [death]. [[G3606]]

### 20
By faith [[G4102]] Isaac [[G2464]] blessed [[G2127]] Jacob [[G2384]] and [[G2532]] Esau [[G2269]] concerning [[G4012]] the future. [[G3195]]

### 21
By faith [[G4102]] Jacob, [[G2384]] when he was dying, [[G599]] blessed [[G2127]] each [[G1538]] of [[G3588]] Joseph’s [[G2501]] sons [[G5207]] and [[G2532]] worshiped [[G4352]] [as he leaned] on [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] top [[G206]] of [[G3588]] his [[G846]] staff. [[G4464]]

### 22
By faith [[G4102]] Joseph, [[G2501]] when his end was near, [[G5053]] spoke about [[G3421]] the [[G3588]] exodus [[G1841]] of the [[G3588]] Israelites [[G2474]] and [[G2532]] gave instructions [[G1781]] about [[G4012]] his [[G846]] bones. [[G3747]]

### 23
By faith [[G4102]] [Moses’] [[G846]] parents [[G3962]] hid him [[G2928]] for three months [[G5150]] after his birth, [[G1080]] because [[G1360]] they saw [[G3708]] [he was] [[G3588]] a beautiful [[G791]] child, [[G3813]] and [[G2532]] they were unafraid [[G5399]] of the [[G3588]] king’s [[G935]] edict. [[G1297]]

### 24
By faith [[G4102]] Moses, [[G3475]] when he was [[G1096]] grown, [[G3173]] refused [[G720]] to be called [[G3004]] [the] son [[G5207]] of Pharaoh’s [[G5328]] daughter. [[G2364]]

### 25
He chose [[G138]] to suffer oppression with [[G4778]] God’s [[G2316]] people [[G2992]] rather [[G3123]] than [[G2228]] to experience [[G2192]] [the] fleeting [[G4340]] enjoyment [[G619]] of sin. [[G266]]

### 26
He valued [[G2233]] disgrace [[G3680]] for Christ [[G5547]] {above} the [[G3588]] treasures [[G2344]] of Egypt, [[G125]] for [[G1063]] he was looking [[G578]] ahead [[G1519]] to [his] [[G3588]] reward. [[G3405]]

### 27
By faith [[G4102]] [Moses] left [[G2641]] Egypt, [[G125]] not [[G3361]] fearing [[G5399]] the [[G3588]] king’s [[G935]] anger; [[G2372]] he persevered [[G2594]] because [[G5613]] he saw [[G3708]] [Him who is] [[G3588]] invisible. [[G517]]

### 28
By faith [[G4102]] he kept [[G4160]] the [[G3588]] Passover [[G3957]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] sprinkling [[G4378]] of blood, [[G129]] so that [[G2443]] the [[G3588]] destroyer [[G3645]] [of] the [[G3588]] firstborn [[G4416]] would not touch [[G2345]] [Israel’s own] [ firstborn ]. [[G846]]

### 29
By faith [[G4102]] [the people] passed through [[G1224]] the [[G3588]] Red [[G2063]] Sea [[G2281]] as [[G5613]] on [[G1223]] dry [[G3584]] land; [[G1093]] [but when] the [[G3588]] Egyptians [[G124]] tried [to follow], [[G3984]] they were drowned. [[G2666]]

### 30
By faith [[G4102]] the [[G3588]] walls [[G5038]] of Jericho [[G2410]] fell, [[G4098]] after [the people] had marched around them [[G2944]] for [[G1909]] seven [[G2033]] days. [[G2250]]

### 31
By faith [[G4102]] the [[G3588]] prostitute [[G4204]] Rahab, [[G4460]] because she welcomed [[G1209]] the [[G3588]] spies [[G2685]] in [[G3326]] peace, [[G1515]] did not perish with [[G4881]] those who [[G3588]] were disobedient. [[G544]]

### 32
And [[G2532]] what [[G5101]] more [[G2089]] shall I say? [[G3004]] Time [[G5550]] will not allow [[G1952]] me [[G1473]] to tell [[G1334]] of [[G4012]] Gideon, [[G1066]] Barak, [[G913]] Samson, [[G4546]] Jephthah, [[G2422]] David, [[G1138]] Samuel, [[G4545]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] prophets, [[G4396]]

### 33
who [[G3739]] through [[G1223]] faith [[G4102]] conquered [[G2610]] kingdoms, [[G932]] administered [[G2038]] justice, [[G1343]] [and] obtained [[G2013]] what was promised; [[G1860]] [who] shut [[G5420]] [the] mouths [[G4750]] of lions, [[G3023]]

### 34
quenched [[G4570]] [the] raging [[G1411]] fire, [[G4442]] [and] escaped [[G5343]] [the] edge [[G4750]] of [the] sword; [[G3162]] [who] gained strength [[G1412]] from [[G575]] weakness, [[G769]] became [[G1096]] mighty [[G2478]] in [[G1722]] battle, [[G4171]] [and] put [[G2827]] foreign [[G245]] armies [to flight]. [[G3925]]

### 35
Women [[G1135]] received back [[G2983]] their [[G846]] dead, [[G3498]] raised to life again. [[G386]] Others [[G243]] were tortured [[G5178]] [and] refused [[G4327]] [their] [[G3588]] release, [[G629]] so that [[G2443]] they might gain [[G5177]] a better [[G2909]] resurrection. [[G386]]

### 36
[Still] [[G1161]] others [[G2087]] endured [[G2983]] mocking [[G1701]] and [[G2532]] flogging, [[G3148]] and [[G1161]] even [[G2089]] chains [[G1199]] and [[G2532]] imprisonment. [[G5438]]

### 37
They were stoned, [[G3034]] they were sawed in two, [[G4249]] they were put to death [[G599]] by [[G1722]] [the] sword. [[G3162]] They went around [[G4022]] in [[G1722]] sheepskins [[G3374]] [and] [[G1722]] goatskins, [[G122]] destitute, [[G5302]] oppressed, [[G2346]] [and] mistreated. [[G2558]]

### 38
The [[G3588]] world [[G2889]] was [[G1510]] not [[G3756]] worthy [[G514]] of [them]. [[G3739]] They wandered [[G4105]] in [[G1909]] deserts [[G2047]] and [[G2532]] mountains, [[G3735]] and [ hid in ] [[G2532]] caves [[G4693]] and [[G2532]] holes [[G3692]] in the [[G3588]] ground. [[G1093]]

### 39
These [[G3778]] {were} all [[G3956]] commended [[G3140]] for [[G1223]] [their] [[G3588]] faith, [[G4102]] [yet] they did not receive [[G2865]] what [was] [[G3588]] promised. [[G1860]]

### 40
God [[G2316]] had planned [[G4265]] something [[G5100]] better [[G2909]] for [[G4012]] us, [[G1473]] so that [[G2443]] together with [[G5565]] us [[G1473]] they would be made perfect. [[G5048]]
