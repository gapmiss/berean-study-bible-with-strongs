###### 1
Now [[G3767]] the [[G3588]] first [ covenant ] [[G4413]] had [[G2192]] regulations [[G1345]] for worship [[G2999]] and [[G5037]] an earthly [[G2886]] sanctuary. [[G40]]

###### 2
A tabernacle [[G4633]] was prepared. [[G2680]] In [[G1722]] [its] [[G3588]] first [room] [[G4413]] [were] [[G5037]] the [[G3588]] lampstand, [[G3087]] the [[G3588]] table, [[G5132]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] consecrated [[G4286]] bread. [[G740]] This [[G3748]] was called [[G3004]] [the] Holy [Place]. [[G40]]

###### 3
Behind [[G3326]] the [[G3588]] second [[G1208]] curtain [[G2665]] [was] a room [[G4633]] called [[G3004]] [the] Most Holy Place, [[G40]]

###### 4
containing [[G2192]] [the] golden [[G5552]] altar of incense [[G2369]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] gold-covered [[G5553]] ark [[G2787]] of the [[G3588]] covenant. [[G1242]] Inside [[G1722]] [the ark] [[G3739]] [were the] gold [[G5552]] jar [[G4713]] of [[G2192]] manna, [[G3131]] Aaron’s [[G2]] staff [[G4464]] that [[G3588]] had budded, [[G985]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] stone tablets [[G4109]] of the [[G3588]] covenant. [[G1242]]

###### 5
Above [[G5231]] [the ark] [[G846]] [were the] cherubim [[G5502]] of glory, [[G1391]] overshadowing [[G2683]] the [[G3588]] mercy seat. [[G2435]] [But] we cannot discuss [[G3004]] [these things] [[G3739]] in [[G2596]] detail [[G3313]] now. [[G3568]]

###### 6
[When] [[G1161]] everything [[G3778]] had been prepared [[G2680]] in this way, [[G3779]] the [[G3588]] priests [[G2409]] entered [[G1524]] regularly [[G1223]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] outer [[G4413]] room [[G4633]] to perform [[G2005]] [their] [[G3588]] sacred duties. [[G2999]]

###### 7
But [[G1161]] only [[G3441]] the [[G3588]] high priest [[G749]] [entered] [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] [inner room], [[G1208]] [and then] only once [[G530]] a year, [[G1763]] [and] never [[G3756]] without [[G5565]] blood, [[G129]] which [[G3739]] he offered [[G4374]] for [[G5228]] himself [[G1438]] and [[G2532]] for the [[G3588]] sins the people had committed in ignorance. [[G51]]

###### 8
By this [arrangement] [[G3778]] the [[G3588]] Holy [[G40]] Spirit [[G4151]] was showing [[G1213]] [that] the [[G3588]] way [[G3598]] into the [[G3588]] Most Holy Place [[G40]] {had} not yet [[G3380]] been disclosed [[G5319]] {as long as} the [[G3588]] first [[G4413]] tabernacle [[G4633]] was [[G2192]] still [[G2089]] standing. [[G4714]]

###### 9
[It is] [[G3748]] an illustration [[G3850]] for [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] present [[G1764]] time, [[G2540]] because [[G2596]] [the] gifts [[G1435]] and [[G2532]] sacrifices [[G2378]] being offered [[G4374]] were unable [[G1410]] to cleanse [[G5048]] [the] conscience [[G4893]] of the [[G3588]] worshiper. [[G3000]]

###### 10
[ They consist ] only [[G3440]] in [[G1909]] food [[G1033]] and [[G2532]] drink [[G4188]] and [[G2532]] special [[G1313]] washings— [[G909]] external [[G4561]] regulations [[G1345]] imposed [[G1945]] until [[G3360]] [the] time [[G2540]] of reform. [[G1357]]

###### 11
But [[G1161]] [when] Christ [[G5547]] came as [[G3854]] high priest [[G749]] of the [[G3588]] good things [[G18]] that have come, [[G1096]] [He entered] [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] greater [[G3173]] and [[G2532]] more perfect [[G5046]] tabernacle [[G4633]] not [[G3756]] made by hands [[G5499]] (that [[G3778]] is, [[G1510]] not [[G3756]] of this [[G3778]] creation). [[G2937]]

###### 12
[He did not enter] [[G3761]] by [[G1223]] [the] blood [[G129]] of goats [[G5131]] and [[G2532]] calves, [[G3448]] but [[G1161]] He entered [[G1525]] the [[G3588]] Most Holy Place [[G40]] once for all [[G2178]] by [[G1223]] [His] [[G3588]] own [[G2398]] blood, [[G129]] thus securing [[G2147]] eternal [[G166]] redemption. [[G3085]]

###### 13
For [[G1063]] if [[G1487]] the [[G3588]] blood [[G129]] of goats [[G5131]] and [[G2532]] bulls [[G5022]] and [[G2532]] [the] ashes [[G4700]] of a heifer [[G1151]] sprinkled [[G4472]] on those who are [[G3588]] ceremonially unclean [[G2840]] sanctify [them] [[G37]] so that [[G4314]] [their] [[G3588]] bodies [[G4561]] are clean, [[G2514]]

###### 14
how much [[G4214]] more [[G3123]] {will} the [[G3588]] blood [[G129]] of Christ, [[G5547]] who [[G3739]] through [[G1223]] [the] eternal [[G166]] Spirit [[G4151]] offered [[G4374]] Himself [[G1438]] unblemished [[G299]] to God, [[G2316]] purify [[G2511]] our [[G1473]] consciences [[G4893]] from [[G575]] works [[G2041]] of death, [[G3498]] so that [[G1519]] we may serve [[G3000]] [the] living [[G2198]] God! [[G2316]]

###### 15
Therefore [[G1223]] [Christ] is [[G1510]] [the] mediator [[G3316]] of a new [[G2537]] covenant, [[G1242]] so that [[G3704]] those who [[G3588]] are called [[G2564]] may receive [[G2983]] the [[G3588]] promised [[G1860]] eternal [[G166]] inheritance, [[G2817]] now that He has died [[G2288]] to [[G1519]] redeem [them] [[G629]] from the [[G3588]] transgressions [committed] [[G3847]] under [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] first [[G4413]] covenant. [[G1242]]

###### 16
In the case of [[G3699]] [a] will, [[G1242]] [it is] necessary [[G318]] to establish [[G5342]] [the] death [[G2288]] of the [one who] [[G3588]] made [it], [[G1303]]

###### 17
because [[G1063]] a will [[G1242]] [does not] take effect [[G949]] until [[G1909]] the [one who] [[G3588]] made [it] [[G1303]] has died; [[G3498]] it cannot be executed [[G2480]] while [[G3753]] he is still alive. [[G2198]]

###### 18
That is why [[G3606]] {even} the [[G3588]] first [covenant] [[G4413]] was not put into effect [[G1457]] without [[G5565]] blood. [[G129]]

###### 19
For [when] [[G1063]] Moses [[G3475]] had proclaimed [[G2980]] every [[G3956]] commandment [[G1785]] of [[G2596]] the [[G3588]] Law [[G3551]] to all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] people, [[G2992]] he took [[G2983]] the [[G3588]] blood [[G129]] of calves [[G3448]] and [[G2532]] goats, [[G5131]] along with [[G3326]] water, [[G5204]] scarlet [[G2847]] wool, [[G2053]] and [[G2532]] hyssop, [[G5301]] [and] sprinkled [[G4472]] the [[G3588]] scroll [[G975]] and [[G2532]] all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] people, [[G2992]]

###### 20
saying, [[G3004]] “This [is] [[G3778]] the [[G3588]] blood [[G129]] of the [[G3588]] covenant, [[G1242]] which [[G3739]] God [[G2316]] has commanded [[G1781]] you [to keep].” [[G4771]]

###### 21
In the same way, [[G3668]] he sprinkled [[G4472]] with [[G3588]] blood [[G129]] the [[G3588]] tabernacle [[G4633]] and [[G2532]] all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] vessels [[G4632]] used in [[G3588]] worship. [[G3009]]

###### 22
According to [[G2596]] the [[G3588]] Law, [[G3551]] in fact, [[G2532]] nearly [[G4975]] everything [[G3956]] must be purified [[G2511]] with [[G1722]] blood, [[G129]] and [[G2532]] without [[G5565]] the shedding of blood [[G130]] there is [[G1096]] no [[G3756]] forgiveness. [[G859]]

###### 23
So [[G3767]] [it was] necessary [[G318]] [for] the [[G3588]] copies [[G5262]] [of] the heavenly [[G3772]] things [[G3588]] to be purified [[G2511]] with these [sacrifices], [[G3778]] but [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] heavenly things [[G2032]] themselves [[G846]] with better [[G2909]] sacrifices [[G2378]] than [[G3844]] these. [[G3778]]

###### 24
For [[G1063]] Christ [[G5547]] did not enter [[G1525]] a man-made [[G5499]] copy [[G499]] of the [[G3588]] TRUE [[G228]] sanctuary, [[G40]] but [[G235]] [He entered] [[G1519]] heaven [[G3772]] itself, [[G846]] now [[G3568]] to appear [[G1718]] on our behalf [[G5228]] in the [[G3588]] presence [[G4383]] of God. [[G2316]]

###### 25
Nor [did He enter heaven] [[G3761]] to [[G2443]] offer [[G4374]] Himself [[G1438]] again and again, [[G4178]] as [[G5618]] the [[G3588]] high priest [[G749]] enters [[G1525]] the [[G3588]] Most Holy Place [[G40]] every [[G2596]] year [[G1763]] with [[G1722]] blood [[G129]] that is not his own. [[G245]]

###### 26
Otherwise, [[G1893]] He [[G846]] would have had [[G1163]] to suffer [[G3958]] repeatedly [[G4178]] since [[G575]] [the] foundation [[G2602]] of [the] world. [[G2889]] But [[G1161]] now [[G3570]] He has appeared [[G5319]] once [for all] [[G530]] at [[G1909]] [the] end [[G4930]] of the [[G3588]] ages [[G165]] to [[G1519]] do away with [[G115]] sin [[G266]] by [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] sacrifice [[G2378]] of Himself. [[G846]]

###### 27
Just [[G2596]] as [[G3745]] man [[G444]] is appointed [[G606]] to die [[G599]] once, [[G530]] and [[G1161]] after [[G3326]] that [[G3778]] [to face] judgment, [[G2920]]

###### 28
so [[G3779]] also [[G2532]] Christ [[G5547]] was offered [[G4374]] once [[G530]] to [[G1519]] bear [[G399]] [the] sins [[G266]] of many; [[G4183]] [and] He will appear [[G3708]] a second time, [[G1208]] not to bear [[G5565]] sin, [[G266]] [but] to [bring] [[G1519]] salvation [[G4991]] to those who [[G3588]] eagerly await [[G553]] Him. [[G846]]
