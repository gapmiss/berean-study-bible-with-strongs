### 1
The [[G3588]] Law [[G3551]] is [[G2192]] only a shadow [[G4639]] of the [[G3588]] good things [[G18]] to come, [[G3195]] not [[G3756]] the [[G3588]] realities [[G1504]] themselves. [[G846]] It can [[G1410]] never, [[G3763]] by the [[G3588]] same [[G846]] sacrifices [[G2378]] offered [[G4374]] year after year, [[G1763]] make perfect [[G5048]] those who [[G3588]] draw near [ to worship ]. [[G4334]]

### 2
[If it could], [[G1893]] would not the offerings have ceased? [[G3973]] For [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] worshipers [[G3000]] would have been cleansed [[G2511]] once [for all], [[G530]] [and] would [[G2192]] no [[G3367]] longer [[G2089]] have felt the guilt [[G4893]] of [their] sins. [[G266]]

### 3
Instead, [[G235]] those [sacrifices] [[G846]] [are] an annual [[G2596]] reminder [[G364]] of sins, [[G266]]

### 4
because [[G1063]] [it is] impossible [[G102]] [for the] blood [[G129]] of bulls [[G5022]] and [[G2532]] of goats [[G5131]] to take away [[G851]] sins. [[G266]]

### 5
Therefore, [[G1352]] when [Christ] came [[G1525]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] world, [[G2889]] He said: [[G3004]] “Sacrifice [[G2378]] and [[G2532]] offering [[G4376]] You did not desire, [[G2309]] but [[G1161]] a body [[G4983]] You prepared [[G2675]] for me. [[G1473]]

### 6
In burnt offerings [[G3646]] and [[G2532]] sin [offerings] [[G266]] You took no delight. [[G2106]]

### 7
Then [[G5119]] I said, [[G2036]] ‘Here I am, [[G2400]] it is written [[G1125]] about [[G4012]] Me [[G1473]] in [[G1722]] [the] scroll: [[G975]] I have come [[G2240]] to do [[G4160]] Your [[G4771]] will, [[G2307]] O God.’” [[G2316]]

### 8
[In the passage ] above [[G511]] He says, [[G3004]] “Sacrifices [[G2378]] and [[G2532]] offerings, [[G4376]] burnt offerings [[G3646]] and [[G2532]] sin [offerings] [[G266]] You did not desire, [[G2309]] nor [[G3761]] did You delight in [them]” [[G2106]] ([although] [[G3748]] [they are] [[G4374]] required by [[G2596]] [the] Law). [[G3551]]

### 9
Then [[G5119]] He adds, [[G2046]] “Here I am, [[G2400]] I have come [[G2240]] to do [[G4160]] Your [[G4771]] will.” [[G2307]] He takes away [[G337]] the [[G3588]] first [[G4413]] to [[G2443]] establish [[G2476]] the [[G3588]] second. [[G1208]]

### 10
[And] by [[G1722]] that [[G3739]] will, [[G2307]] we [[G1510]] have been sanctified [[G37]] through [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] sacrifice [[G4376]] of the [[G3588]] body [[G4983]] of Jesus [[G2424]] Christ [[G5547]] once for all. [[G2178]]

### 11
Day after day [[G2250]] every [[G3956]] priest [[G2409]] stands [[G2476]] to minister [[G3008]] and [[G2532]] to offer [[G4374]] again and again [[G4178]] the [[G3588]] same [[G846]] sacrifices, [[G2378]] which [[G3748]] can [[G1410]] never [[G3763]] take away [[G4014]] sins. [[G266]]

### 12
But [when] [[G1161]] this [Priest] [[G3778]] had offered [[G4374]] for all time [[G1336]] one [[G1520]] sacrifice [[G2378]] for [[G5228]] sins, [[G266]] He sat down [[G2523]] at [[G1722]] [the] right hand [[G1188]] of God. [[G2316]]

### 13
Since that time, [[G3063]] He waits [[G1551]] for [[G2193]] His [[G846]] enemies [[G2190]] to be made [[G5087]] a footstool [[G5286]] for [[G3588]] His [[G846]] feet, [[G4228]]

### 14
because [[G1063]] by a single [[G1520]] offering [[G4376]] He has made perfect [[G5048]] for [[G1519]] all time [[G1336]] those who [[G3588]] are sanctified. [[G37]]

### 15
The [[G3588]] Holy [[G40]] Spirit [[G4151]] also [[G2532]] testifies [[G3140]] to us {about this}. [[G1473]] [First] [[G3326]] He says: [[G2046]]

### 16
“This [is] [[G3778]] the [[G3588]] covenant [[G1242]] I will make [[G1303]] with [[G4314]] them [[G846]] after [[G3326]] those [[G1565]] days, [[G2250]] declares [[G3004]] [the] Lord. [[G2962]] I will put [[G1325]] My [[G1473]] Laws [[G3551]] in [[G1909]] their [[G846]] hearts [[G2588]] and [[G2532]] inscribe [[G1924]] them [[G846]] on [[G1909]] their [[G846]] minds. [[G1271]]

### 17
[Then He adds]: [[G2532]] “Their [[G846]] sins [[G266]] and [[G2532]] lawless acts [[G458]] I will remember [[G3403]] no [[G3756]] more.” [[G2089]]

### 18
And [[G1161]] where [[G3699]] these [[G3778]] have been forgiven, [[G859]] an offering [[G4376]] for [[G4012]] sin [[G266]] [is] no longer [ needed ]. [[G3765]]

### 19
Therefore, [[G3767]] brothers, [[G80]] [since] we have [[G2192]] confidence [[G3954]] to [[G1519]] enter [[G1529]] the [[G3588]] Most Holy Place [[G40]] by [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] blood [[G129]] of Jesus, [[G2424]]

### 20
by [the] new [[G4372]] and [[G2532]] living [[G2198]] way [[G3598]] opened [[G1457]] for us [[G1473]] through [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] curtain [[G2665]] of His [[G846]] body, [[G4561]]

### 21
and [since we have] [[G2532]] a great [[G3173]] High Priest [[G2409]] over [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] house [[G3624]] of God, [[G2316]]

### 22
let us draw near [[G4334]] with [[G3326]] a sincere [[G228]] heart [[G2588]] in [[G1722]] full assurance [[G4136]] of faith, [[G4102]] {having} our [[G3588]] hearts [[G2588]] sprinkled to cleanse us [[G4472]] from [[G575]] a guilty [[G4190]] conscience [[G4893]] and [[G2532]] [our] [[G3588]] bodies [[G4983]] washed [[G3068]] with pure [[G2513]] water. [[G5204]]

### 23
Let us hold [[G2722]] resolutely [[G186]] to the [[G3588]] hope [[G1680]] we profess, [[G3671]] for [[G1063]] He who [[G3588]] promised [[G1861]] [is] faithful. [[G4103]]

### 24
And [[G2532]] let us consider [[G2657]] how [[G1519]] to spur [[G3948]] one another {on} [[G240]] to love [[G26]] and [[G2532]] good [[G2570]] deeds. [[G2041]]

### 25
Let us not neglect [[G1459]] meeting together, [[G1997]] as [[G2531]] some [[G5100]] [have made a] habit, [[G1485]] but [[G235]] let us encourage [one another], [[G3870]] and [[G2532]] all [[G5118]] [the] more [[G3123]] as [[G3745]] you see [[G991]] the [[G3588]] Day [[G2250]] approaching. [[G1448]]

### 26
[If] we [[G1473]] deliberately [[G1596]] go on sinning [[G264]] after [[G3326]] we have received [[G2983]] the [[G3588]] knowledge [[G1922]] of the [[G3588]] truth, [[G225]] no further [[G3765]] sacrifice [[G2378]] for [[G4012]] sins [[G266]] remains, [[G620]]

### 27
but only [[G1161]] a [[G5100]] fearful [[G5398]] expectation [[G1561]] of judgment [[G2920]] and [[G2532]] raging [[G2205]] fire [[G4442]] that will [[G3195]] consume [[G2068]] [all] [[G3588]] adversaries. [[G5227]]

### 28
Anyone who [[G5100]] rejected [[G114]] [the] Law [[G3551]] of Moses [[G3475]] died [[G599]] without [[G5565]] mercy [[G3628]] on [the testimony of] [[G1909]] two [[G1417]] or [[G2228]] three [[G5140]] witnesses. [[G3144]]

### 29
How much [[G4214]] more severely [[G5501]] do you think [[G1380]] one [[G3588]] deserves [[G515]] to be punished [[G5098]] [who] has trampled on [[G2662]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of God, [[G2316]] profaned [[G2839]] the [[G3588]] blood [[G129]] of the [[G3588]] covenant [[G1242]] that [[G3739]] sanctified him, [[G37]] and [[G2532]] insulted [[G1796]] the [[G3588]] Spirit [[G4151]] of grace? [[G5485]]

### 30
For [[G1063]] we know [[G1492]] Him who [[G3588]] said, [[G2036]] “Vengeance [is] [[G1557]] Mine; [[G1473]] I [[G1473]] will repay,” [[G467]] and [[G2532]] again, [[G3825]] “[The] Lord [[G2962]] will judge [[G2919]] His [[G846]] people.” [[G2992]]

### 31
[It is] a fearful thing [[G5398]] to fall [[G1706]] into [[G1519]] [the] hands [[G5495]] of [the] living [[G2198]] God. [[G2316]]

### 32
Remember [[G363]] the [[G3588]] early [[G4386]] days [[G2250]] that you were in the light, [[G5461]] when [[G3739]] you endured [[G5278]] a great [[G4183]] conflict [[G119]] in the face of suffering. [[G3804]]

### 33
Sometimes [[G3778]] you were publicly exposed [[G2301]] to ridicule [[G3680]] and [[G2532]] persecution; [[G2347]] at other times [[G3778]] you were [[G1096]] partners [[G2844]] with those who [were] [[G3588]] so [[G3779]] treated. [[G390]]

### 34
You sympathized [[G4834]] with those [[G3588]] in prison [[G1198]] and [[G2532]] joyfully [[G5479]] accepted [[G4327]] the [[G3588]] confiscation [[G724]] of [[G3588]] your [[G4771]] property, [[G5225]] knowing that [[G1097]] you yourselves [[G1438]] had [[G2192]] a better [[G2909]] and [[G2532]] permanent [[G3306]] possession. [[G5223]]

### 35
So [[G3767]] {do} not [[G3361]] throw away [[G577]] your [[G4771]] confidence; [[G3954]] [it] [[G3748]] holds [[G2192]] a great [[G3173]] reward. [[G3405]]

### 36
You [[G2192]] need [[G5532]] to persevere, [[G5281]] so that [[G2443]] after you have done [[G4160]] God’s [[G2316]] will, [[G2307]] you will receive [[G2865]] what [[G3588]] He has promised. [[G1860]]

### 37
For, [[G1063]] “In just a [[G3745]] little [[G3398]] while, [[G3745]] He who [[G3588]] is coming [[G2064]] will come [[G2240]] and [[G2532]] will not delay. [[G5549]]

### 38
But [[G1161]] My [[G1473]] righteous [[G1342]] one [[G3588]] will live [[G2198]] by [[G1537]] faith; [[G4102]] and [[G2532]] if [[G1437]] he shrinks back, [[G5288]] I [[G1473]] {will take} no [[G3756]] pleasure [[G2106]] in [[G1722]] him.” [[G846]]

### 39
But [[G1161]] we [[G1473]] are [[G1510]] not [[G3756]] of [those who] shrink back [[G5289]] [and] [[G1519]] are destroyed, [[G684]] but [[G235]] of [those who have] faith [[G4102]] [and] [[G1519]] preserve [[G4047]] [their] souls. [[G5590]]
