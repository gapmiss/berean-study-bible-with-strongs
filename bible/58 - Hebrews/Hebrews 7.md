###### 1
This [[G3778]] Melchizedek [[G3198]] [was] king [[G935]] of Salem [[G4532]] [and] priest [[G2409]] of God [[G2316]] Most High. [[G5310]] He met [[G4876]] Abraham [[G11]] returning [[G5290]] from [[G575]] the [[G3588]] slaughter [[G2871]] of the [[G3588]] kings [[G935]] and [[G2532]] blessed [[G2127]] him, [[G846]]

###### 2
and [[G2532]] Abraham [[G11]] apportioned [[G3307]] to [him] [[G3739]] a tenth [[G1181]] of [[G575]] everything. [[G3956]] First, [[G4412]] [his name] [[G3303]] means [[G2059]] “king [[G935]] of righteousness.” [[G1343]] Then [[G1899]] also, [[G2532]] “king [[G935]] of Salem” [[G4532]] means [[G1510]] “king [[G935]] of peace.” [[G1515]]

###### 3
Without father [[G540]] [or] mother [[G282]] [or] genealogy, [[G35]] without [[G2192]] beginning [[G746]] of days [[G2250]] [or] [[G3383]] end [[G5056]] of life, [[G2222]] like [[G871]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of God, [[G2316]] he remains [[G3306]] a priest [[G2409]] for [[G1519]] all time. [[G1336]]

###### 4
Consider [[G2334]] how great [[G4080]] [Melchizedek was]: [[G3778]] Even [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] patriarch [[G3966]] Abraham [[G11]] gave [[G1325]] [him] [[G3739]] a tenth [[G1181]] of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] spoils. [[G205]]

###### 5
Now [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] Law [[G3551]] commands [[G1785]] the [[G3588]] sons [[G5207]] of Levi [[G3017]] who become [[G2983]] priests [[G2405]] to collect a tenth [[G586]] from the [[G3588]] people [[G2992]] (that [[G3778]] is, [[G1510]] their [[G846]] brothers), [[G80]] even though [[G2539]] they are descended [[G1831]] from [[G1537]] Abraham. [[G11]]

###### 6
But [[G1161]] [Melchizedek], [[G3588]] who did not trace his descent [[G1075]] from [[G1537]] [Levi], [[G846]] collected a tenth [[G1183]] from Abraham [[G11]] and [[G2532]] blessed [[G2127]] him who [[G3588]] had [[G2192]] the [[G3588]] promises. [[G1860]]

###### 7
And [[G1161]] indisputably, [[G485]] the [[G3588]] lesser [[G1640]] is blessed [[G2127]] by [[G5259]] the [[G3588]] greater. [[G2909]]

###### 8
In the case [of the Levites], [[G5602]] mortal [[G599]] men [[G444]] collect [[G2983]] the tenth; [[G1181]] but [[G1161]] in the case [of Melchizedek], [[G1563]] it is affirmed [[G3140]] that [[G3754]] he lives on. [[G2198]]

###### 9
And [[G2532]] so [[G5613]] to speak, [[G2036]] Levi, [[G3017]] who [[G3588]] collects [[G2983]] [the] tenth, [[G1181]] paid [the] tenth [[G1183]] through [[G1223]] Abraham. [[G11]]

###### 10
For [[G1063]] when [[G3753]] Melchizedek [[G3198]] met [[G4876]] Abraham, [[G846]] [Levi] was [[G1510]] still [[G2089]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] loin [[G3751]] of [his] [[G3588]] ancestor. [[G3962]]

###### 11
Now [[G3767]] if [[G1487]] perfection [[G5050]] could have been attained [[G1510]] through [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] Levitical [[G3020]] priesthood [[G2420]] ( [[G1063]] upon [[G1909]] [which] basis [[G846]] the [[G3588]] people [[G2992]] received [the] Law), [[G3549]] why [[G5101]] [was there] still [[G2089]] need [[G5532]] [for] another [[G2087]] priest [[G2409]] to appear— [[G450]] [one] [[G3004]] in [[G2596]] the [[G3588]] order [[G5010]] of Melchizedek [[G3198]] and [[G2532]] not [[G3756]] in [[G2596]] the [[G3588]] order [[G5010]] of Aaron? [[G2]]

###### 12
For [when] [[G1063]] the [[G3588]] priesthood [[G2420]] is changed, [[G3346]] [the] Law [[G3551]] must [[G318]] be changed [[G3331]] as well. [[G2532]]

###### 13
[He] of [[G1909]] whom [[G3739]] these things [[G3778]] are said [[G3004]] belonged to [[G3348]] a different [[G2087]] tribe, [[G5443]] from [[G575]] which [[G3739]] no one [[G3762]] has ever served [[G4337]] at the [[G3588]] altar. [[G2379]]

###### 14
For [[G1063]] [it is] clear [[G4271]] that [[G3754]] our [[G1473]] Lord [[G2962]] descended [[G393]] from [[G1537]] Judah, [[G2448]] a tribe [[G5443]] as to [[G1519]] which [[G3739]] Moses [[G3475]] said [[G2980]] nothing [[G3762]] about [[G4012]] priests. [[G2409]]

###### 15
And [[G2532]] [ this point ] is [[G1510]] even [[G2089]] more [[G4053]] clear [[G2612]] if [[G1487]] another [[G2087]] priest [[G2409]] like [[G3665]] Melchizedek [[G3198]] appears, [[G450]]

###### 16
one who [[G3739]] has become [a priest] [[G1096]] not [[G3756]] by [[G2596]] a law [[G3551]] of succession, [[G1785]] but [[G235]] by [[G2596]] [the] power [[G1411]] of an indestructible [[G179]] life. [[G2222]]

###### 17
For [[G1063]] it is testified: [[G3140]] “You [are] [[G4771]] a priest [[G2409]] forever [[G165]] in [[G2596]] the [[G3588]] order [[G5010]] of Melchizedek.” [[G3198]]

###### 18
So [[G3303]] the former [[G4254]] commandment [[G1785]] is [[G1096]] set aside [[G115]] because [[G1223]] it [was] [[G846]] weak [[G772]] and [[G2532]] useless [[G512]]

###### 19
(for [[G1063]] the [[G3588]] Law [[G3551]] made nothing perfect [[G5048]] ), [[G3762]] and [[G1161]] a better [[G2909]] hope [[G1680]] [is] introduced, [[G1898]] by [[G1223]] which [[G3739]] we draw near [[G1448]] to God. [[G2316]]

###### 20
And [[G2532]] none [[G3756]] of this [[G3745]] [happened] without [[G5565]] an oath. [[G3728]] For [[G1063]] [others] [[G3588]] became [[G1096]] priests [[G2409]] without [[G5565]] an oath, [[G3728]]

###### 21
but [[G1161]] [Jesus became a priest] [[G3588]] with [[G3326]] an oath [[G3728]] by [[G1223]] the [One who] [[G3588]] said [[G3004]] to [[G4314]] Him: [[G846]] “[The] Lord [[G2962]] has sworn [[G3660]] and [[G2532]] will not change His mind: [[G3338]] ‘You [are] [[G4771]] a priest [[G2409]] forever.’” [[G165]]

###### 22
Because of [[G2596]] this [[G5118]] [oath], [[G2532]] Jesus [[G2424]] has become [[G1096]] [the] guarantee [[G1450]] of a better [[G2909]] covenant. [[G1242]]

###### 23
Now [[G2532]] there [[G1510]] have been [[G1096]] many [[G4119]] [other] [[G3588]] priests, [[G2409]] since [[G1223]] death [[G2288]] prevented them from [[G2967]] continuing [in office]. [[G3887]]

###### 24
But [[G1161]] because [[G1223]] [Jesus] [[G846]] lives [[G3306]] forever, [[G165]] He has [[G2192]] a permanent [[G531]] priesthood. [[G2420]]

###### 25
Therefore [[G3606]] He is able [[G1410]] to save [[G4982]] completely [[G3838]] those who [[G3588]] draw near [[G4334]] to God [[G2316]] through [[G1223]] Him, [[G846]] [since He] always [[G3842]] lives [[G2198]] to intercede [[G1793]] for [[G5228]] them. [[G846]]

###### 26
Such [[G5108]] a high priest [[G749]] truly [[G1063]] befits [[G4241]] us— [[G1473]] [One who is] holy, [[G3741]] innocent, [[G172]] undefiled, [[G283]] set apart [[G5563]] from [[G575]] sinners, [[G268]] and [[G2532]] exalted [[G1096]] above [[G5308]] the [[G3588]] heavens. [[G3772]]

###### 27
[Unlike] [[G5618]] the [other] [[G3588]] high priests, [[G749]] [He] [[G3739]] does [[G2192]] not [[G3756]] need [[G318]] to offer [[G399]] daily [[G2250]] sacrifices, [[G2378]] first [[G4386]] for [[G5228]] [His] [[G3588]] own [[G2398]] sins [[G266]] and then [[G1899]] for [the sins] [[G3588]] of the [[G3588]] people; [[G2992]] He [sacrificed for sin] [[G4160]] once for all [[G2178]] when He offered up [[G399]] Himself. [[G1438]]

###### 28
For [[G1063]] the [[G3588]] Law [[G3551]] appoints [[G2525]] as high priests [[G749]] men [[G444]] who are [[G2192]] weak; [[G769]] but [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] oath, [[G3728]] which [came] [[G3588]] after [[G3326]] the [[G3588]] Law, [[G3551]] [appointed] [[G3056]] [the] Son, [[G5207]] who has been made perfect [[G5048]] forever. [[G165]]
