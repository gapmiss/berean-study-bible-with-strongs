[[Hebrews 4|←]] • [[Hebrews 6|→]]

### 1
Every [[G3956]] high priest [[G749]] is appointed [[G2525]] from among [[G1537]] men [[G444]] to represent [[G5228]] [them] [[G444]] in matters [[G3588]] relating to [[G4314]] God, [[G2316]] to [[G2443]] offer [[G4374]] gifts [[G1435]] and [[G2532]] sacrifices [[G2378]] for [[G5228]] sins. [[G266]]

### 2
He is able [[G1410]] to deal gently [[G3356]] with those who [[G3588]] are ignorant [[G50]] and [[G2532]] misguided, [[G4105]] since [[G1893]] he himself [[G846]] is beset by [[G4029]] weakness. [[G769]]

### 3
That is why [[G1223]] he is obligated [[G3784]] to offer sacrifices [[G4374]] for [[G4012]] his own [[G846]] sins, [[G266]] as well as [[G2531]] for [the sins of] [[G4012]] the [[G3588]] people. [[G2992]]

### 4
No [[G3756]] one [[G5100]] takes [[G2983]] [this] [[G3588]] honor [[G5092]] upon himself; [[G1438]] he must be called [[G2564]] by [[G5259]] God, [[G2316]] just as [[G2531]] Aaron [[G2]] [was]. [[G2532]]

### 5
So [[G3779]] also [[G2532]] Christ [[G5547]] did not take upon Himself the glory [[G1392]] of becoming [[G1096]] a high priest, [[G749]] but [He was called] [[G235]] by the [One who] [[G3588]] said [[G2980]] to [[G4314]] Him: [[G846]] “You [[G4771]] are [[G1510]] My [[G1473]] Son; [[G5207]] today [[G4594]] I [[G1473]] have become Your Father.” [[G1080]]

### 6
And [[G2532]] in [[G1722]] another [passage] [[G2087]] [God] says: [[G3004]] “You [are] [[G4771]] a priest [[G2409]] forever [[G165]] in [[G2596]] the [[G3588]] order [[G5010]] of Melchizedek.” [[G3198]]

### 7
During [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] days [[G2250]] of [[G3588]] [Jesus’] [[G846]] earthly [life], [[G4561]] He offered up [[G4374]] prayers [[G1162]] and [[G2532]] petitions [[G2428]] with [[G3326]] loud [[G2478]] cries [[G2906]] and [[G2532]] tears [[G1144]] to [[G4314]] the [One who] [[G3588]] could [[G1410]] save [[G4982]] Him [[G846]] from [[G1537]] death, [[G2288]] and [[G2532]] He was heard [[G1522]] because of [[G575]] [His] [[G3588]] reverence. [[G2124]]

### 8
Although [[G2539]] He was [[G1510]] a Son, [[G5207]] He learned [[G3129]] obedience [[G5218]] from [[G575]] what [[G3739]] He suffered. [[G3958]]

### 9
And [[G2532]] having been made perfect, [[G5048]] He became [[G1096]] [the] source [[G159]] of eternal [[G166]] salvation [[G4991]] to all [[G3956]] who [[G3588]] obey [[G5219]] Him [[G846]]

### 10
[and] was designated [[G4316]] by [[G5259]] God [as] [[G2316]] high priest [[G749]] in [[G2596]] the [[G3588]] order [[G5010]] of Melchizedek. [[G3198]]

### 11
We [have] [[G1473]] much [[G4183]] to say [[G3056]] about [[G4012]] [this], [[G3739]] [but it is] [[G2532]] hard to explain, [[G1421]] because [[G1893]] you are [[G1096]] dull [[G3576]] of [[G3588]] hearing. [[G189]]

### 12
Although [[G2532]] by [[G1223]] [this] [[G3588]] time [[G5550]] you ought [[G3784]] to be [[G1510]] teachers, [[G1320]] you [[G2192]] need [[G5532]] [someone] [[G3588]] to reteach [[G1321]] you [[G4771]] the [[G3588]] basic [[G746]] principles [[G4747]] of God’s [[G2316]] word. [[G3051]] You need [[G5532]] milk, [[G1051]] not [[G3756]] solid [[G4731]] food! [[G5160]]

### 13
Everyone [[G3956]] who [[G3588]] lives on [[G3348]] milk [[G1051]] is [still] [[G1510]] an infant, [[G3516]] inexperienced [[G552]] in [the] message [[G3056]] of righteousness. [[G1343]]

### 14
But [[G1161]] solid [[G4731]] food [[G5160]] is [[G1510]] [for the] mature, [[G5046]] who [[G3588]] by [[G1223]] constant use [[G1838]] have [[G2192]] trained [[G1128]] [their] [[G3588]] sensibilities [[G145]] to [[G4314]] distinguish [[G1253]] good [[G2570]] [from] [[G2532]] evil. [[G2556]]
