###### 1
Now when the queen [[H4436]] of Sheba [[H7614]] heard [[H8085]] about the fame [[H8088]] of Solomon [[H8010]] concerning the name [[H8034]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] she came [[H935]] to test him [[H5254]] with difficult questions. [[H2420]]

###### 2
She arrived [[H935]] in Jerusalem [[H3389]] with a very [[H3966]] large [[H3515]] caravan, [[H2428]] with camels [[H1581]] bearing [[H5375]] spices, [[H1314]] gold [[H2091]] in great [[H3966]] abundance, [[H7227]] and precious [[H3368]] stones. [[H68]] So she came [[H935]] to [[H413]] Solomon [[H8010]] and spoke [[H1696]] to him [[H413]] all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] was [[H1961]] on [[H5973]] her mind. [[H3824]]

###### 3
And Solomon [[H8010]] answered [[H5046]] all [[H3605]] her questions; [[H1697]] nothing [[H3808]] was [[H1961]] too difficult [[H5956]] for [[H4480]] the king [[H4428]] to explain. [[H5046]]

###### 4
When the queen [[H4436]] of Sheba [[H7614]] saw [[H7200]] all [[H3605]] the wisdom [[H2451]] of Solomon, [[H8010]] the palace [[H1004]] he had built, [[H1129]]

###### 5
the food [[H3978]] at his table, [[H7979]] the seating [[H4186]] of his servants, [[H5650]] the service [[H4612]] and attire [[H4403]] of his attendants [[H8334]] and cupbearers, [[H4945]] and the burnt offerings [[H5930]] he presented [[H5927]] at the house [[H1004]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] it took her breath [[H7307]] away. [[H3808]]

###### 6
She said [[H559]] to [[H413]] the king, [[H4428]] “The report [[H1697]] I heard [[H8085]] in my own country [[H776]] about [[H5921]] your words [[H1697]] [and] [[H5921]] wisdom [[H2451]] is [[H1961]] true. [[H571]]

###### 7
But I did not [[H3808]] believe [[H539]] these things [[H1697]] until [[H5704]] I came [[H935]] and saw [[H7200]] with my own eyes. [[H5869]] Indeed, [[H2009]] not even [[H3808]] half [[H2677]] was told [[H5046]] to me.  Your wisdom [[H2451]] and prosperity [[H2896]] have far [[H413]] exceeded [[H3254]] the report [[H8052]] I heard. [[H8085]]

###### 8
How blessed [[H835]] are your men! [[H376]] How blessed [[H835]] are these [[H428]] servants of yours [[H5650]] who stand [[H5975]] continually [[H8548]] before you [[H6440]] [and] hear [[H8085]] your wisdom! [[H2451]]

###### 9
Blessed [[H1288]] be [[H1961]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God, [[H430]] who [[H834]] has delighted [[H2654]] in you  to set [[H5414]] you on [[H5921]] the throne [[H3678]] of Israel. [[H3478]] Because of the LORD’s [[H3068]] eternal [[H5769]] love [[H160]] for Israel, [[H3478]] He has made you [[H7760]] king [[H4428]] to carry out [[H6213]] justice [[H4941]] and righteousness. [[H6666]]

###### 10
Then she gave [[H5414]] the king [[H4428]] 120 [[H3967]] talents [[H3603]] of gold, [[H2091]] a great quantity of [[H7235]] spices, [[H1314]] and precious [[H3368]] stones. [[H68]] Never [[H3808]] again [[H5750]] was such [[H1931]] an abundance [[H7230]] of spices [[H1314]] brought in [[H935]] as those [[H834]] the queen [[H4436]] of Sheba [[H7614]] gave [[H5414]] to King [[H4428]] Solomon. [[H8010]]

###### 11
(The fleet [[H590]] of Hiram, [[H2438]] which [[H834]] brought [[H5375]] gold [[H2091]] from Ophir, [[H211]] also [[H1571]] brought [[H935]] from Ophir [[H211]] a great cargo [[H7235]] of almug [[H484]] wood [[H6086]] and precious [[H3368]] stones. [[H68]]

###### 12
The king [[H4428]] made [[H6213]] the almug [[H484]] wood [[H6086]] into steps [[H4552]] for the house [[H1004]] of the LORD [[H3069]] and for the king’s [[H4428]] palace, [[H1004]] and into lyres [[H3658]] and harps [[H5035]] for the singers. [[H7891]] Never [[H3808]] before had such [[H3651]] almug [[H484]] wood [[H6086]] been brought in, [[H935]] nor has such [[H3808]] been seen [[H7200]] to [[H5704]] this [[H2088]] day.) [[H3117]]

###### 13
King [[H4428]] Solomon [[H8010]] gave [[H5414]] the queen [[H4436]] of Sheba [[H7614]] all [[H3605]] she desired— [[H2656]] whatever [[H834]] she asked— [[H7592]] besides [[H905]] what [[H834]] he had given [[H5414]] her  out of [his] [[H8010]] royal [[H4428]] bounty. [[H3027]] Then she [[H1931]] left [[H6437]] and returned [[H1980]] to her own country, [[H776]] along with her servants. [[H5650]]

###### 14
The weight [[H4948]] of gold [[H2091]] that [[H834]] came [[H935]] to Solomon [[H8010]] each year [[H8141]] was [[H1961]] 666 [[H8337]] talents, [[H3603]]

###### 15
not including [[H905]] the revenue [[H4536]] from the merchants, [[H376]] traders, [[H7402]] and all [[H3605]] the Arabian [[H6152]] kings [[H4428]] and governors [[H6346]] of the land. [[H776]]

###### 16
King [[H4428]] Solomon [[H8010]] made [[H6213]] two hundred [[H3967]] large shields [[H6793]] [of] hammered [[H7820]] gold; [[H2091]] six [[H8337]] hundred [shekels] [[H3967]] of gold [[H2091]] went [[H5927]] into [[H5921]] each [[H259]] shield. [[H6793]]

###### 17
[He also made] three [[H7969]] hundred [[H3967]] small shields [[H4043]] of hammered [[H7820]] gold; [[H2091]] three [[H7969]] minas [[H4488]] of gold [[H2091]] went [[H5927]] into [[H5921]] each [[H259]] shield. [[H4043]] And the king [[H4428]] put them [[H5414]] in the House [[H1004]] of the Forest [[H3293]] of Lebanon. [[H3844]]

###### 18
Additionally, the king [[H4428]] made [[H6213]] a great [[H1419]] throne [[H3678]] of ivory [[H8127]] and overlaid it [[H6823]] with pure [[H6338]] gold. [[H2091]]

###### 19
The throne [[H3678]] had six [[H8337]] steps [[H4609]] and a rounded [[H5696]] top [[H7218]] at the back [[H310]] of the throne. [[H3678]] There were armrests [[H3027]] on both sides [[H2088]] of [[H413]] the seat, [[H4725]] with [a] [[H8147]] lion [[H738]] standing [[H5975]] beside [[H681]] each armrest. [[H3027]]

###### 20
Twelve [[H8147]] lions [[H738]] stood [[H5975]] on [[H5921]] the six [[H8337]] steps, [[H4609]] one at either end [[H2088]] of each [step]. [[H2088]] Nothing [[H3808]] like [this] [[H3651]] had ever been made [[H6213]] for any [[H3605]] kingdom. [[H4467]]

###### 21
All [[H3605]] of King [[H4428]] Solomon’s [[H8010]] drinking [[H4945]] cups [[H3627]] were gold, [[H2091]] and all [[H3605]] the utensils [[H3627]] of the House [[H1004]] of the Forest [[H3293]] of Lebanon [[H3844]] were pure [[H5462]] gold. [[H2091]] There was no [[H369]] silver, [[H3701]] because it was accounted [[H2803]] as nothing [[H3808]] in the days [[H3117]] of Solomon. [[H8010]]

###### 22
For [[H3588]] the king had [[H4428]] the ships [[H590]] of Tarshish [[H8659]] at sea [[H3220]] with [[H5973]] Hiram’s [[H2438]] fleet, [[H590]] and once [[H259]] every three years [[H7969]] the ships [[H590]] of Tarshish [[H8659]] would arrive [[H935]] bearing [[H5375]] gold, [[H2091]] silver, [[H3701]] ivory, [[H8143]] apes, [[H6971]] and peacocks. [[H8500]]

###### 23
So King [[H4428]] Solomon [[H8010]] surpassed [[H1431]] all [[H3605]] the kings [[H4428]] of the earth [[H776]] in riches [[H6239]] and in wisdom. [[H2451]]

###### 24
The whole [[H3605]] world [[H776]] sought [[H1245]] an audience [[H6440]] with Solomon [[H8010]] to hear [[H8085]] the wisdom [[H2451]] that [[H834]] God [[H430]] had put [[H5414]] in his heart. [[H3820]]

###### 25
Year [[H8141]] after year, [[H8141]] [each] visitor [[H376]] would bring [[H935]] his tribute: [[H4503]] articles [[H3627]] of silver [[H3701]] and gold, [[H2091]] clothing, [[H8008]] weapons, [[H5402]] spices, [[H1314]] horses, [[H5483]] and mules. [[H6505]]

###### 26
Solomon [[H8010]] accumulated [[H622]] 1,400 {} [[H505]] chariots [[H7393]] and 12,000 [[H8147]] horses, [[H6571]] which he stationed [[H5148]] in the chariot [[H7393]] cities [[H5892]] and also with [[H5973]] [him] [[H4428]] in Jerusalem. [[H3389]]

###### 27
The king [[H4428]] made [[H5414]] silver [[H3701]] as common in Jerusalem [[H3389]] as stones, [[H68]] and [[H5414]] cedar [[H730]] as abundant [[H7230]] as sycamore [[H8256]] in the foothills. [[H8219]]

###### 28
Solomon’s [[H834]] horses [[H5483]] were imported [[H4161]] from Egypt [[H4714]] and Kue; [[H4723]] the royal [[H4428]] merchants [[H5503]] purchased them [[H3947]] in Kue. [[H4723]]

###### 29
A chariot [[H4818]] could be imported [[H5927]] from Egypt [[H4714]] for six [[H8337]] hundred [shekels] [[H3967]] of silver, [[H3701]] and a horse [[H5483]] for a hundred [[H3967]] and fifty. [[H2572]] Likewise, [[H3651]] [they] [[H3027]] exported them [[H3318]] to all [[H3605]] the kings [[H4428]] of the Hittites [[H2850]] and to the kings [[H4428]] of Aram. [[H758]]
