### 1
Then three [[H7969]] years [[H8141]] passed [[H3427]] without [[H369]] war [[H4421]] between [[H996]] Aram [[H758]] and Israel. [[H3478]]

### 2
However, [[H1961]] in the third [[H7992]] year, [[H8141]] Jehoshaphat [[H3092]] king [[H4428]] of Judah [[H3063]] went down [[H3381]] to [[H413]] [visit] the king [[H4428]] of Israel, [[H3478]]

### 3
[who] [[H4428]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] his servants, [[H5650]] “Do you not know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] Ramoth-gilead [[H7433]] is ours,  but we [[H587]] have failed [[H2814]] to take [[H3947]] it [[H853]] from the hand [[H3027]] of the king [[H4428]] of Aram?” [[H758]]

### 4
So he asked [[H559]] Jehoshaphat, [[H3092]] “Will you go [[H1980]] with me [[H854]] to fight [[H4421]] against Ramoth-gilead?” [[H7433]] Jehoshaphat [[H3092]] answered [[H559]] the king [[H4428]] of Israel, [[H3478]] “I [am] [[H3644]] as you [are], [[H3644]] my people [[H5971]] as your people, [[H5971]] [and] my horses [[H5483]] as your horses.” [[H5483]]

### 5
But Jehoshaphat [[H3092]] also said [[H559]] to [[H413]] the king [[H4428]] of Israel, [[H3478]] “Please [[H4994]] inquire [[H1875]] first [[H3117]] for the word [[H1697]] of the LORD.” [[H3068]]

### 6
So the king [[H4428]] of Israel [[H3478]] assembled [[H6908]] the prophets, [[H5030]] about four [[H702]] hundred [[H3967]] men, [[H376]] and asked them, [[H559]] “Should I go [[H1980]] to war [[H4421]] against [[H5921]] Ramoth-gilead, [[H7433]] or [[H518]] should I refrain?” [[H2308]] “Go up,” [[H5927]] they replied, [[H559]] “and the Lord [[H136]] will deliver [it] [[H5414]] into the hand [[H3027]] of the king.” [[H4428]]

### 7
But Jehoshaphat [[H3092]] asked, [[H559]] “Is [there] not [[H369]] still [[H5750]] a prophet [[H5030]] of the LORD [[H3068]] here [[H6311]] of whom we can inquire?” [[H1875]]

### 8
The king [[H4428]] of Israel [[H3478]] answered, [[H559]] “There is still [[H5750]] one [[H259]] man [[H376]] who can ask [[H1875]] the LORD, [[H3068]] but I [[H589]] hate him [[H8130]] because [[H3588]] he never [[H3808]] prophesies [[H5012]] anything good [[H2896]] for me, [[H5921]] but only [[H3588]] bad. [[H7451]] He is Micaiah [[H4321]] son [[H1121]] of Imlah.” [[H3229]] “The king [[H4428]] should not [[H408]] say [[H559]] that!” [[H3651]] Jehoshaphat [[H3092]] replied. [[H559]]

### 9
So the king [[H4428]] of Israel [[H3478]] called [[H7121]] one [[H259]] of his officials [[H5631]] and said, [[H559]] “Bring [[H4116]] Micaiah [[H4321]] the son [[H1121]] of Imlah {at once}.” [[H3229]]

### 10
Dressed [[H3847]] in royal attire, [[H899]] the king [[H4428]] of Israel [[H3478]] and Jehoshaphat [[H3092]] king [[H4428]] of Judah [[H3063]] were sitting [[H3427]] on [[H5921]] their thrones [[H3678]] at the threshing floor [[H1637]] by the entrance [[H6607]] of the gate [[H8179]] of Samaria, [[H8111]] with all [[H3605]] the prophets [[H5030]] prophesying [[H5012]] before them. [[H6440]]

### 11
Now Zedekiah [[H6667]] son [[H1121]] of Chenaanah [[H3668]] had made [[H6213]] for himself  iron [[H1270]] horns [[H7161]] and declared, [[H559]] “This is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] says: [[H559]] ‘With these [[H428]] you shall gore [[H5055]] the Arameans [[H758]] until [[H5704]] they are finished off.’” [[H3615]]

### 12
And all [[H3605]] the prophets [[H5030]] were prophesying [[H5012]] the same, [[H3651]] saying, [[H559]] “Go up [[H5927]] to Ramoth-gilead [[H7433]] and prosper, [[H6743]] for the LORD [[H3068]] will deliver [it] [[H5414]] into the hand [[H3027]] of the king.” [[H4428]]

### 13
Then the messenger [[H4397]] who [[H834]] had gone [[H1980]] to call [[H7121]] Micaiah [[H4321]] instructed him, [[H1696]] “Behold [[H2009]] now, [[H4994]] with one [[H259]] accord [[H6310]] the words [[H1697]] of the prophets [[H5030]] are favorable [[H2896]] to the king. [[H4428]] So please [[H4994]] let your words [[H1697]] be [[H1961]] like theirs, [[H1697]] and speak [[H1696]] favorably.” [[H2896]]

### 14
But Micaiah [[H4321]] said, [[H559]] “As surely as the LORD [[H3068]] lives, [[H2416]] I will speak [[H1696]] whatever [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] tells [[H559]] me.” [[H413]]

### 15
When Micaiah arrived, [[H935]] the king [[H4428]] asked [[H559]] him, [[H413]] “Micaiah, [[H4321]] should we go [[H1980]] to war [[H4421]] against [[H413]] Ramoth-gilead, [[H7433]] or [[H518]] should we refrain?” [[H2308]] “Go up [[H5927]] and triumph,” [[H6743]] Micaiah replied, [[H559]] “for the LORD [[H3068]] will give [it] [[H5414]] into the hand [[H3027]] of the king.” [[H4428]]

### 16
But the king [[H4428]] said [[H559]] to him, [[H413]] “How many [[H5704]] times [[H6471]] must I [[H589]] make you swear [[H7650]] not [[H3808]] to tell [[H1696]] me anything but [[H7535]] the truth [[H571]] in the name [[H8034]] of the LORD?” [[H3068]]

### 17
So Micaiah declared: [[H559]] “I saw [[H7200]] all [[H3605]] Israel [[H3478]] scattered [[H6327]] on [[H413]] the hills [[H2022]] like sheep [[H6629]] without [[H369]] a shepherd. [[H7462]] And the LORD [[H3068]] said, [[H559]] ‘These [people] [[H428]] have no [[H3808]] master; [[H113]] let each one [[H376]] return [[H7725]] home [[H1004]] in peace.’” [[H7965]]

### 18
Then the king [[H4428]] of Israel [[H3478]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Jehoshaphat, [[H3092]] “Did I not [[H3808]] tell [[H559]] you [[H413]] that he never [[H3808]] prophesies [[H5012]] good [[H2896]] for me, [[H5921]] but only [[H3588]] bad?” [[H7451]]

### 19
Micaiah continued, [[H559]] “Therefore [[H3651]] hear [[H8085]] the word [[H1697]] of the LORD: [[H3068]] I saw [[H7200]] the LORD [[H3068]] sitting [[H3427]] on [[H5921]] His throne, [[H3678]] and all [[H3605]] the host [[H6635]] of heaven [[H8064]] standing [[H5975]] on His right hand [[H3225]] and on His left. [[H8040]]

### 20
And the LORD [[H3068]] said, [[H559]] ‘Who [[H4310]] will entice [[H6601]] Ahab [[H256]] to march up [[H5927]] and fall [[H5307]] at Ramoth-gilead?’ [[H7433]] And one [[H2088]] suggested [[H559]] this, [[H3541]] and another [[H2088]] that. [[H3541]]

### 21
Then a spirit [[H7307]] came forward, [[H3318]] stood [[H5975]] before [[H6440]] the LORD, [[H3068]] and said, [[H559]] ‘I [[H589]] will entice him.’ [[H6601]] ‘By what means?’ [[H3964]] asked [[H413]] the LORD. [[H3068]]

### 22
And he replied, [[H559]] ‘I will go out [[H3318]] and be [[H1961]] a lying [[H8267]] spirit [[H7307]] in the mouth [[H6310]] of all [[H3605]] his prophets.’ [[H5030]] ‘You will surely [[H1571]] entice him [[H6601]] and prevail,’ [[H3201]] said [the LORD]. [[H559]] ‘Go [[H3318]] and do [[H6213]] it.’ [[H3651]]

### 23
So [[H6258]] you see, [[H2009]] the LORD [[H3068]] has put [[H5414]] a lying [[H8267]] spirit [[H7307]] in the mouths [[H6310]] of all [[H3605]] these [[H428]] prophets of yours, [[H5030]] and the LORD [[H3068]] has pronounced [[H1696]] disaster [[H7451]] against you.” [[H5921]]

### 24
Then Zedekiah [[H6667]] son [[H1121]] of Chenaanah [[H3668]] went up, [[H5066]] struck [[H5221]] Micaiah [[H4321]] in [[H5921]] the face, [[H3895]] and demanded, [[H559]] “Which way [[H335]] did the Spirit [[H7307]] of the LORD [go] [[H3068]] when He departed [[H5674]] from me [[H853]] to speak [[H1696]] to you?” [[H854]]

### 25
Micaiah [[H4321]] replied, [[H559]] “You will soon see, [[H7200]] on that [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] when [[H834]] you go [[H935]] [and] hide [[H2247]] in an inner [[H2315]] room.” [[H2315]]

### 26
And the king [[H4428]] of Israel [[H3478]] declared, [[H559]] “Take [[H3947]] Micaiah [[H4321]] and return [[H7725]] him to [[H413]] Amon [[H526]] the governor [[H8269]] of the city [[H5892]] and to [[H413]] Joash [[H3101]] the king’s [[H4428]] son, [[H1121]]

### 27
and tell them [[H559]] that this is what [[H3541]] the king [[H4428]] says: [[H559]] ‘Put [[H7760]] this [man] [[H2088]] in prison [[H1004]] and feed him [[H398]] only bread [[H3899]] and water [[H4325]] until [[H5704]] I return [[H935]] safely.’” [[H7965]]

### 28
But Micaiah [[H4321]] replied, [[H559]] “If [[H518]] you ever return [[H7725]] safely, [[H7965]] the LORD [[H3068]] has not [[H3808]] spoken through me.” [[H1696]] Then he added, [[H559]] “Take heed, [[H8085]] all [[H3605]] you people!” [[H5971]]

### 29
So the king [[H4428]] of Israel [[H3478]] and Jehoshaphat [[H3092]] king [[H4428]] of Judah [[H3063]] went up [[H5927]] to Ramoth-gilead. [[H7433]]

### 30
And the king [[H4428]] of Israel [[H3478]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Jehoshaphat, [[H3092]] “I will disguise [[H2664]] myself and go [[H935]] into battle, [[H4421]] but you [[H859]] wear [[H3847]] your royal robes.” [[H899]] So the king [[H4428]] of Israel [[H3478]] disguised himself [[H2664]] and went [[H935]] into battle. [[H4421]]

### 31
Now the king [[H4428]] of Aram [[H758]] had ordered [[H6680]] his thirty-two [[H7970]] chariot [[H7393]] commanders, [[H8269]] “Do not [[H3808]] fight [[H3898]] with anyone, [[H854]] small [[H6996]] or great, [[H1419]] except [[H3588]] the king [[H4428]] of Israel.” [[H3478]]

### 32
When the chariot [[H7393]] commanders [[H8269]] saw [[H7200]] Jehoshaphat, [[H3092]] they [[H1992]] said, [[H559]] “Surely [[H389]] this [[H1931]] is the king [[H4428]] of Israel!” [[H3478]] So they turned [[H5493]] to fight [[H3898]] against him, [[H5921]] but Jehoshaphat [[H3092]] cried out. [[H2199]]

### 33
And [[H1961]] when the chariot [[H7393]] commanders [[H8269]] saw [[H7200]] that [[H3588]] he [[H1931]] was not [[H3808]] the king [[H4428]] of Israel, [[H3478]] they turned back [[H7725]] from pursuing him. [[H310]]

### 34
However, a [certain] man [[H376]] drew [[H4900]] his bow [[H7198]] without taking special aim, [[H8537]] and he struck [[H5221]] the king [[H4428]] of Israel [[H3478]] between [[H996]] the joints [[H1694]] of his armor. [[H8302]] So [the king] said [[H559]] to his charioteer, [[H7395]] “Turn around [[H2015]] and take me out [[H3318]] of [[H4480]] the battle, [[H4264]] for [[H3588]] I am badly wounded!” [[H2470]]

### 35
The battle [[H4421]] raged [[H5927]] throughout that [[H1931]] day, [[H3117]] and the king [[H4428]] was [[H1961]] propped up [[H5975]] in his chariot [[H4818]] facing [[H5227]] the Arameans. [[H758]] And the blood [[H1818]] from his wound [[H4347]] ran out [[H3332]] onto [[H413]] the floor [[H2436]] of the chariot, [[H7393]] and that evening [[H6153]] he died. [[H4191]]

### 36
As the sun [[H8121]] was setting, [[H935]] the cry [[H7440]] rang out [[H5674]] in the army: [[H4264]] “Every man [[H376]] to [[H413]] his own city, [[H5892]] and every man [[H376]] to [[H413]] his own land!” [[H776]]

### 37
So the king [[H4428]] died [[H4191]] and was brought [[H935]] to Samaria, [[H8111]] where they buried [[H6912]] [him]. [[H4428]]

### 38
And [someone] washed [[H7857]] the chariot [[H7393]] at [[H5921]] the pool [[H1295]] of Samaria [[H8111]] where the prostitutes [[H2185]] bathed, [[H7364]] and the dogs [[H3611]] licked up [[H3952]] [Ahab's] blood, [[H1818]] according to the word [[H1697]] that the LORD [[H3068]] had spoken. [[H1696]]

### 39
As for the rest [[H3499]] of the acts [[H1697]] of Ahab, [[H256]] along with all [[H3605]] his accomplishments [[H834]] and the ivory [[H8127]] palace [[H1004]] and all [[H3605]] the cities [[H5892]] he built, [[H1129]] [are] they [[H1992]] not [[H3808]] written [[H3789]] in [[H5921]] the Book [[H5612]] of the Chronicles [[H1697]] of the Kings [[H4428]] of Israel? [[H3478]]

### 40
And Ahab [[H256]] rested [[H7901]] with [[H5973]] his fathers, [[H1]] and his son [[H1121]] Ahaziah [[H274]] reigned [[H4427]] in his place. [[H8478]]

### 41
In the fourth [[H702]] year [[H8141]] of Ahab's [[H256]] reign [[H4428]] over Israel, [[H3478]] Jehoshaphat [[H3092]] son [[H1121]] of Asa [[H609]] became king [[H4427]] of [[H5921]] Judah. [[H3063]]

### 42
Jehoshaphat [[H3092]] was thirty-five [[H7970]] years [[H8141]] old [[H1121]] when he became king, [[H4427]] and he reigned [[H4427]] in Jerusalem [[H3389]] twenty-five [[H6242]] years. [[H8141]] His mother’s [[H517]] name [[H8034]] was Azubah [[H5806]] daughter [[H1323]] of Shilhi. [[H7977]]

### 43
And [Jehoshaphat] walked [[H1980]] in all [[H3605]] the ways [[H1870]] of his father [[H1]] Asa; [[H609]] he did not [[H3808]] turn away [[H5493]] from them, [[H4480]] but did [[H6213]] what was right [[H3477]] in the eyes [[H5869]] of the LORD. [[H3068]] The high places, [[H1116]] however, [[H389]] were not [[H3808]] removed; [[H5493]] the people [[H5971]] still [[H5750]] sacrificed [[H2076]] and burned incense [[H6999]] on the high places. [[H1116]]

### 44
Jehoshaphat [[H3092]] also made peace [[H7999]] with [[H5973]] the king [[H4428]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

### 45
As for the rest [[H3499]] of the acts [[H1697]] of Jehoshaphat, [[H3092]] along with the might [[H1369]] he exercised [[H6213]] and how [[H834]] he waged war, [[H3898]] [are] they [[H1992]] not [[H3808]] written [[H3789]] in [[H5921]] the Book [[H5612]] of the Chronicles [[H1697]] of the Kings [[H4428]] of Judah? [[H3063]]

### 46
He banished [[H1197]] from [[H4480]] the land [[H776]] [any] [[H3499]] male cult prostitutes [[H6945]] who [[H834]] had remained [[H7604]] from the days [[H3117]] of his father [[H1]] Asa. [[H609]]

### 47
And there was no [[H369]] king [[H4428]] in Edom; [[H123]] a deputy [[H5324]] served as king. [[H4428]]

### 48
Jehoshaphat [[H3092]] built [[H6240]] ships [[H591]] of Tarshish [[H8659]] to go [[H1980]] to Ophir [[H211]] for gold, [[H2091]] but they never [[H3808]] set sail, [[H1980]] because [[H3588]] [they] [[H591]] were wrecked [[H7665]] at Ezion-geber. [[H6100]]

### 49
At that time [[H227]] Ahaziah [[H274]] son [[H1121]] of Ahab [[H256]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Jehoshaphat, [[H3092]] “Let my servants [[H5650]] sail [[H1980]] with [[H5973]] your servants,” [[H5650]] but Jehoshaphat [[H3092]] refused. [[H3808]]

### 50
And Jehoshaphat [[H3092]] rested [[H7901]] with [[H5973]] his fathers [[H1]] and was buried [[H6912]] with [[H5973]] them [[H1]] in the city [[H5892]] of his father [[H1]] David, [[H1732]] and his son [[H1121]] Jehoram [[H3088]] reigned [[H4427]] in his place. [[H8478]]

### 51
In the seventeenth [[H7651]] year [[H8141]] of Jehoshaphat's [[H3092]] reign [[H4428]] over Judah, [[H3063]] Ahaziah [[H274]] son [[H1121]] of Ahab [[H256]] became king [[H4427]] of [[H5921]] Israel, [[H3478]] and he reigned [[H4427]] in Samaria [[H8111]] two years. [[H8141]]

### 52
And he did [[H6213]] evil [[H7451]] in the sight [[H5869]] of the LORD [[H3068]] and walked [[H1980]] in the ways [[H1870]] of his father [[H1]] [and] [[H1870]] mother, [[H517]] [and] [[H1870]] of Jeroboam [[H3379]] son [[H1121]] of Nebat, [[H5028]] who [[H834]] had caused Israel [[H3478]] to sin. [[H2398]]

### 53
[Ahaziah] served [[H5647]] and worshiped [[H7812]] Baal, [[H1168]] provoking [[H3707]] the LORD, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of Israel, {to anger}, [[H3478]] just as [[H3605]] his father [[H1]] had done. [[H6213]]
