###### 1
Now  Ben-hadad [[H1130]] king [[H4428]] of Aram [[H758]] assembled [[H6908]] his entire [[H3605]] army. [[H2426]] Accompanied by [[H854]] thirty-two [[H7970]] kings [[H4428]] with their horses [[H5483]] and chariots, [[H7393]] he marched up, [[H5927]] besieged [[H6696]] Samaria, [[H8111]] and waged war [[H3898]] against it. 

###### 2
Then he sent [[H7971]] messengers [[H4397]] into the city [[H5892]] to [[H413]] Ahab [[H256]] king [[H4428]] of Israel, [[H3478]]

###### 3
saying, [[H559]] “This is what  Ben-hadad [[H1130]] says: [[H559]] ‘Your silver [[H3701]] and gold [[H2091]] are [[H1931]] mine,  and your best [[H2896]] wives [[H802]] and children [[H1121]] are [[H1992]] mine!’” 

###### 4
And the king [[H4428]] of Israel [[H3478]] replied, [[H6030]] “Just as you say, [[H1697]] my lord [[H113]] the king: [[H4428]] I am yours, [[H589]] along with all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] I have.” 

###### 5
The messengers [[H4397]] came back [[H7725]] and said, [[H559]] “This is what [[H3541]] Ben-hadad [[H1130]] says: [[H559]] ‘I have sent [[H7971]] to you [[H413]] to demand [[H559]] your silver, [[H3701]] your gold, [[H2091]] your wives, [[H802]] and your children. [[H1121]]

###### 6
But [[H3588]] about [[H518]] this time [[H6256]] tomorrow [[H4279]] I will send [[H7971]] my servants [[H5650]] to search [[H2664]] your palace [[H1004]] and [[H853]] the houses [[H1004]] of your servants. [[H5650]] They will seize [[H7760]] and take away [[H3947]] all that [[H3605]] is [[H1961]] precious [[H4261]] to you.’” [[H5869]]

###### 7
Then the king [[H4428]] of Israel [[H3478]] summoned [[H7121]] all [[H3605]] the elders [[H2205]] of the land [[H776]] and said, [[H559]] “Please [[H4994]] take note, [[H3045]] and you will see [[H7200]] that [[H3588]] this [man] [[H2088]] is looking for [[H1245]] trouble, [[H7451]] for [[H3588]] when he demanded [[H7971]] my wives, [[H802]] my children, [[H1121]] my silver, [[H3701]] and my gold, [[H2091]] I did not [[H3808]] deny [[H4513]] him. [[H4480]]

###### 8
And the elders [[H2205]] and [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] all [[H3605]] said, [[H559]] “Do not [[H408]] listen [[H8085]] or [[H3808]] consent to his terms.” [[H14]]

###### 9
So [Ahab] answered [[H559]] the messengers [[H4397]] of Ben-hadad, [[H1130]] “Tell [[H559]] my lord [[H113]] the king, [[H4428]] ‘All [[H3605]] that [[H834]] you demanded [[H7971]] of [[H413]] your servant [[H5650]] the first time [[H7223]] I will do, [[H6213]] but this [[H2088]] thing [[H1697]] I cannot [[H3808]] do.’” [[H6213]] So the messengers [[H4397]] departed [[H1980]] and relayed the message to [Ben-hadad]. [[H1697]]

###### 10
Then Ben-hadad [[H1130]] sent [[H7971]] another message [[H559]] to [Ahab]: [[H413]] “May the gods [[H430]] deal [[H3541]] with me,  and ever so [[H3541]] severely, [[H3254]] if [[H518]] [enough] dust [[H6083]] remains [[H5606]] of Samaria [[H8111]] for each [[H3605]] of my men [[H5971]] [to have] a handful.” [[H8168]]

###### 11
And the king [[H4428]] of Israel [[H3478]] replied, [[H6030]] “Tell him: [[H1696]] ‘The one putting on [his armor] [[H2296]] should not [[H408]] boast [[H1984]] like one taking [it off].’” [[H6605]]

###### 12
Ben-hadad received [[H8085]] this [[H2088]] message [[H1697]] while he [[H1931]] and the kings [[H4428]] were drinking [[H8354]] in their tents, [[H5521]] and he said [[H559]] to [[H413]] his servants, [[H5650]] “Take your positions.” [[H7760]] So they stationed themselves [[H7760]] against [[H5921]] the city. [[H5892]]

###### 13
Meanwhile [[H2009]] a [[H259]] prophet [[H5030]] approached [[H5066]] Ahab [[H256]] king [[H4428]] of Israel [[H3478]] and declared, [[H559]] “This is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] says: [[H559]] ‘Do you see [[H7200]] this [[H2088]] entire [[H3605]] great [[H1419]] army? [[H1995]] Behold, [[H2005]] I will deliver it [[H5414]] into your hand [[H3027]] this very day, [[H3117]] and you will know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I [[H589]] am the LORD. [[H3068]]

###### 14
“By whom?” [[H4310]] Ahab [[H256]] asked. [[H559]] And the prophet replied, [[H559]] “This is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] says: [[H559]] ‘By the young officers [[H5288]] of the district [[H4082]] governors.’” [[H8269]] “Who [[H4310]] will start [[H631]] the battle?” [[H4421]] asked [Ahab]. [[H559]] “You [will],” [[H859]] answered the prophet. [[H559]]

###### 15
So Ahab assembled [[H6485]] the young officers [[H5288]] of the district [[H4082]] governors, [[H8269]] and there were [[H1961]] 232 men. [[H3967]] And after them, [[H310]] he assembled [[H6485]] [the rest of] [[H3605]] the Israelite [[H1121]] troops, [[H5971]] 7,000 [[H7651]] in all. [[H3605]]

###### 16
They marched out [[H3318]] at noon [[H6672]] while Ben-hadad [[H1130]] and the 32 [[H7970]] kings [[H4428]] allied [[H5826]] with him [[H853]] were in their tents [[H5521]] getting [[H8354]] drunk. [[H7910]]

###### 17
And the young officers [[H5288]] of the district [[H4082]] governors [[H8269]] marched out first. [[H3318]] Now Ben-hadad [[H1130]] had sent out scouts, [[H7971]] who reported [[H5046]] to him,  “Men [[H582]] are marching out [[H3318]] of Samaria.” [[H8111]]

###### 18
“If [[H518]] they have marched out [[H3318]] in peace,” [[H7965]] he said, [[H559]] “take [[H8610]] them alive. [[H2416]] Or if [[H518]] they have marched out [[H3318]] for war, [[H4421]] take [[H8610]] them alive.” [[H2416]]

###### 19
Meanwhile, these [[H428]] young officers [[H5288]] of the district [[H4082]] governors [[H8269]] marched out [[H3318]] of [[H4480]] the city, [[H5892]] with the army [[H2428]] behind them, [[H310]]

###### 20
and each [[H376]] one struck down [[H5221]] his opponent. [[H376]] So the Arameans [[H758]] fled, [[H5127]] with the Israelites [[H3478]] in pursuit. [[H7291]] But Ben-hadad [[H1130]] king [[H4428]] of Aram [[H758]] escaped [[H4422]] on [[H5921]] horseback [[H5483]] with the cavalry. [[H6571]]

###### 21
Then the king [[H4428]] of Israel [[H3478]] marched out [[H3318]] and attacked [[H5221]] the horses [[H5483]] and chariots, [[H7393]] inflicting [[H5221]] a great [[H1419]] slaughter [[H4347]] on the Arameans. [[H758]]

###### 22
Afterward, the prophet [[H5030]] approached [[H5066]] the king [[H4428]] of Israel [[H3478]] and said, [[H559]] “Go [[H1980]] and strengthen [your position], [[H2388]] and take note [[H3045]] what [[H834]] you must do, [[H6213]] for [[H3588]] in the spring [[H8666]] the king [[H4428]] of Aram [[H758]] will march [[H5927]] against you.” [[H5921]]

###### 23
Meanwhile, the servants [[H5650]] of the king [[H4428]] of Aram [[H758]] said [[H559]] to him, [[H413]] “Their gods [are] [[H430]] gods [[H430]] of the hills. [[H2022]] That is why [[H5921]] they prevailed [[H2388]] over us. [[H4480]] Instead, [[H199]] we should fight [[H3898]] them [[H854]] on the plains; [[H4334]] surely then [[H518]] we will prevail. [[H2388]]

###### 24
So [[H853]] do [[H6213]] this: [[H2088]] Dismiss [[H5493]] all [[H376]] the kings [[H4428]] from their positions [[H4725]] and replace them [[H7760]] with other officers. [[H6346]]

###### 25
And you [[H859]] must raise [[H4487]] an army [[H2428]] like the [one] [[H2428]] you have lost— [[H5307]] horse [[H5483]] for horse [[H5483]] and chariot [[H7393]] for chariot— [[H7393]] so we can fight [[H3898]] [the Israelites] [[H853]] on the plain, [[H4334]] where we will surely [[H518]] prevail. [[H2388]] And [the king] approved [[H8085]] their plan [[H6963]] and acted [[H6213]] accordingly. [[H3651]]

###### 26
In the spring, [[H8666]] Ben-hadad [[H1130]] mobilized [[H6485]] the Arameans [[H758]] and went up [[H5927]] to Aphek [[H663]] to fight [[H4421]] against [[H5973]] Israel. [[H3478]]

###### 27
The Israelites [[H1121]] also mobilized, [[H6485]] gathered supplies, [[H3557]] and marched out [[H1980]] to meet them. [[H7125]] The Israelites [[H1121]] camped [[H2583]] before them [[H5048]] like two [[H8147]] small flocks [[H2835]] of goats, [[H5795]] while the Arameans [[H758]] covered [[H4390]] the countryside. [[H776]]

###### 28
Then the man [[H376]] of God [[H430]] approached [[H5066]] the king [[H4428]] of Israel [[H3478]] and said, [[H559]] “This is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] says: [[H559]] ‘Because [[H3282]] the Arameans [[H758]] think [[H559]] the LORD [[H3068]] is a god [[H430]] of the hills [[H2022]] and not [[H3808]] of the valleys, [[H6010]] I will deliver [[H5414]] all [[H3605]] this [[H2088]] great [[H1419]] army [[H1995]] into your hand. [[H3027]] Then you will know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I [[H589]] am the LORD. [[H3068]]

###### 29
For seven [[H7651]] days [[H3117]] [the armies] camped [[H2583]] opposite each other, [[H428]] and [[H1961]] on the seventh [[H7637]] day [[H3117]] the battle [[H4421]] ensued, [[H7126]] and the Israelites [[H1121]] struck down [[H5221]] the Arameans— [[H758]] a hundred [[H3967]] thousand [[H505]] foot soldiers [[H7273]] in one [[H259]] day. [[H3117]]

###### 30
The rest of them [[H3498]] fled [[H5127]] into [[H413]] the city [[H5892]] of Aphek, [[H663]] where the wall [[H2346]] fell [[H5307]] on [[H5921]] twenty-seven [[H6242]] thousand [[H505]] of the remaining [[H3498]] men. [[H376]] Ben-hadad [[H1130]] also fled [[H5127]] to the city [[H5892]] and hid [[H935]] in [[H413]] an inner room. [[H2315]]

###### 31
Then the servants of [Ben-hadad] [[H5650]] said [[H559]] to him, [[H413]] “Look [[H2009]] now, [[H4994]] we have heard [[H8085]] that [[H3588]] the kings [[H4428]] of the house [[H1004]] of Israel [[H3478]] are merciful. [[H2617]] Let us go out [[H3318]] to [[H413]] the king [[H4428]] of Israel [[H3478]] [with] [[H7760]] sackcloth [[H8242]] around our waists [[H4975]] and ropes [[H2256]] around our heads. [[H7218]] Perhaps [[H194]] he will spare [[H2421]] your life. [[H5315]]

###### 32
So [with] [[H2296]] sackcloth [[H8242]] around their waists [[H4975]] and ropes [[H2256]] around their heads, [[H7218]] they went [[H935]] to [[H413]] the king [[H4428]] of Israel [[H3478]] and said, [[H559]] “Your servant [[H5650]] Ben-hadad [[H1130]] says, [[H559]] ‘Please [[H4994]] spare [[H2421]] my life.’” [[H5315]] And [the king] answered, [[H559]] “Is he still [[H5750]] alive? [[H2416]] He [[H1931]] is my brother.” [[H251]]

###### 33
Now the men [[H376]] were looking for a sign of hope, [[H5172]] and they quickly [[H4116]] grasped [at this word] [[H2480]] and replied, [[H559]] “Yes, your brother [[H251]] Ben-hadad.” [[H1130]] “Go [[H935]] and get him!” [[H3947]] said [the king]. [[H559]] Then Ben-hadad [[H1130]] came out, [[H3318]] and Ahab had him come up [[H5927]] into [[H5921]] his chariot. [[H4818]]

###### 34
Ben-hadad said [[H559]] to him, [[H413]] “I will restore [[H7725]] the cities [[H5892]] my father [[H1]] took [[H3947]] from [[H853]] your father; [[H1]] you may set up [[H7760]] your own  marketplaces [[H2351]] in Damascus, [[H1834]] as [[H834]] my father [[H1]] [did] [[H7760]] in Samaria.” [[H8111]] “By this covenant [[H1285]] I [[H589]] release you,” [Ahab replied]. [[H7971]] So he made [[H3772]] a treaty [[H1285]] with him  and sent him away. [[H7971]]

###### 35
Meanwhile, by the word [[H1697]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] one [[H259]] of the sons [[H1121]] of the prophets [[H5030]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] his companion, [[H7453]] “Strike me, [[H5221]] please!” [[H4994]] But [the man] refused [[H3985]] to strike him. [[H5221]]

###### 36
Then [the prophet] said [[H559]] to him,  “Because [[H3282]] you have not [[H3808]] obeyed [[H8085]] the voice [[H6963]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] as soon as [[H2005]] you depart [[H1980]] from me [[H853]] a lion [[H738]] will kill you.” [[H5221]] And when he left, [[H1980]] a lion [[H738]] found him [[H4672]] and killed him. [[H5221]]

###### 37
Then the prophet found [[H4672]] another [[H312]] man [[H376]] and said, [[H559]] “Strike me, [[H5221]] please!” [[H4994]] So the man [[H376]] struck him [[H5221]] and wounded him, [[H5221]]

###### 38
and the prophet [[H5030]] went [[H1980]] and waited [[H5975]] on [[H5921]] the road [[H1870]] for the king, [[H4428]] disguising himself [[H2664]] with a bandage [[H666]] over [[H5921]] his eyes. [[H5869]]

###### 39
As the king [[H4428]] passed by, [[H5674]] he [[H1931]] cried out [[H6817]] to [[H413]] the king: [[H4428]] “Your servant [[H5650]] had marched out [[H3318]] into the middle [[H7130]] of the battle, [[H4421]] when suddenly [[H2009]] a man [[H376]] came over [[H5493]] with [[H935]] a captive [[H376]] and told [[H559]] me, [[H413]] ‘Guard [[H8104]] this [[H2088]] man! [[H376]] If [[H518]] he goes missing [[H6485]] for any reason, [[H6485]] your life [[H5315]] will be exchanged [[H1961]] for [[H8478]] his life, [[H5315]] or [[H176]] you will weigh out [[H8254]] a talent [[H3603]] of silver. [[H3701]]

###### 40
But while your servant [[H5650]] was [[H1961]] busy [[H6213]] here [[H2008]] and there, [[H2008]] [the man] [[H1931]] disappeared.” [[H369]] And the king [[H4428]] of Israel [[H3478]] said [[H559]] to him, [[H413]] “So [[H3651]] [shall] your judgment [be]; [[H4941]] you have pronounced it [[H2782]] on yourself.” [[H859]]

###### 41
Then [the prophet] quickly [[H4116]] removed [[H5493]] the bandage [[H666]] from [[H5921]] his eyes, [[H5869]] and the king [[H4428]] of Israel [[H3478]] recognized [[H5234]] him [[H853]] as [[H3588]] one of the prophets. [[H5030]]

###### 42
And [the prophet] said [[H559]] to [the king], [[H413]] “This is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] says: [[H559]] ‘Because [[H3282]] you have let slip [[H7971]] from your hand [[H3027]] the man [[H376]] I had set apart for destruction, [[H2764]] your life [[H5315]] will be exchanged [[H1961]] for [[H8478]] his life, [[H5315]] and your people [[H5971]] for [[H8478]] his people.’” [[H5971]]

###### 43
Sullen [[H5620]] and angry, [[H2198]] the king [[H4428]] of Israel [[H3478]] went [[H1980]] home [[H1004]] to Samaria. [[H8111]]
