### 1
In the four [[H702]] hundred [[H3967]] and eightieth [[H8084]] year [[H8141]] after the Israelites [[H1121]] had come [[H3318]] out of the land [[H776]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] in the month [[H2320]] of Ziv, [[H2099]] the second [[H8145]] month [[H2320]] of the fourth [[H7243]] year [[H8141]] of [Solomon's] reign [[H4427]] over [[H5921]] Israel, [[H3478]] [he] [[H8010]] began to build [[H1129]] the house [[H1004]] of the LORD. [[H3068]]

### 2
The house [[H1004]] that [[H834]] King [[H4428]] Solomon [[H8010]] built [[H1129]] for the LORD [[H3068]] [was] sixty [[H8346]] cubits [[H520]] long, [[H753]] twenty [cubits] [[H6242]] wide, [[H7341]] and thirty [[H7970]] cubits [[H520]] high. [[H6967]]

### 3
The portico [[H197]] at [[H5921]] the front [[H6440]] of the main hall [[H1964]] of the temple [[H1004]] [was] twenty [[H6242]] cubits [[H520]] long, [[H753]] extending across [[H5921]] the width [[H7341]] of the temple [[H1004]] and projecting out [[H7341]] ten [[H6235]] cubits [[H520]] in [[H5921]] front [[H6440]] of the temple. [[H1004]]

### 4
He also had [[H6213]] narrow [[H331]] windows [[H2474]] framed high [[H8261]] in the temple. [[H1004]]

### 5
Against [[H5921]] the walls [[H7023]] of the temple [[H1004]] and the inner sanctuary, [[H1687]] [Solomon] built [[H1129]] a chambered structure [[H3326]] all around [[H5439]] the temple, [[H1004]] in which [[H5439]] he constructed [[H6213]] the side rooms. [[H6763]]

### 6
The bottom [[H8481]] floor [was] [[H3326]] five [[H2568]] cubits [[H520]] wide, [[H7341]] the middle floor [[H8484]] six [[H8337]] cubits, [[H520]] and the third [floor] [[H7992]] seven [[H7651]] cubits. [[H520]] He also placed [[H5414]] offset ledges [[H4052]] all around [[H5439]] the outside [[H2351]] of the temple, [[H1004]] so that nothing [[H1115]] would be inserted [[H270]] into [its] [[H1004]] walls. [[H7023]]

### 7
The temple [[H1004]] was constructed [[H1129]] using [[H1129]] finished [[H8003]] stones [[H68]] cut at the quarry, [[H4551]] so that no [[H3808]] hammer, [[H4717]] chisel, [[H1631]] or any [[H3605]] iron [[H1270]] tool [[H3627]] was heard [[H8085]] in the temple [[H1004]] while it was being built. [[H1129]]

### 8
The entrance [[H6607]] to the bottom [[H8484]] floor [[H6763]] was on [[H413]] the south [[H3233]] side [[H3802]] of the temple. [[H1004]] A stairway [[H3883]] led up [[H5927]] to [[H5921]] the middle level, [[H8484]] and from [[H4480]] [there] [[H8484]] to [[H413]] the third floor. [[H7992]]

### 9
So [Solomon] built [[H1129]] the temple [[H1004]] and finished it, [[H3615]] roofing [[H5603]] it [[H1004]] with beams [[H1356]] and planks [[H7713]] of cedar. [[H729]]

### 10
He built [[H1129]] chambers [[H3326]] all along [[H5921]] the temple, [[H1004]] [each] five [[H2568]] cubits [[H520]] high [[H6967]] and attached [[H270]] to the temple [[H1004]] with beams [[H6086]] of cedar. [[H730]]

### 11
Then the word [[H1697]] of the LORD [[H3069]] came [[H1961]] to [[H413]] Solomon, [[H8010]] saying: [[H559]]

### 12
“As for this [[H2088]] temple [[H1004]] you [[H859]] are building, [[H1129]] if [[H518]] you walk [[H1980]] in  My statutes, [[H2708]] carry out [[H6213]] My ordinances, [[H4941]] and keep [[H8104]] all [[H3605]] My commandments [[H4687]] by walking in them, [[H1980]] I will fulfill [[H6965]] through you [[H854]] the promise [[H1697]] I made [[H1696]] to [[H413]] your father [[H1]] David. [[H1732]]

### 13
And I will dwell [[H7931]] among [[H8432]] the Israelites [[H1121]] and will not [[H3808]] abandon [[H5800]] My people [[H5971]] Israel.” [[H3478]]

### 14
So Solomon [[H8010]] built [[H1129]] the temple [[H1004]] and finished [[H3615]] it. [[H853]]

### 15
He lined [[H1129]] the interior [[H1004]] walls [[H7023]] with cedar [[H730]] paneling [[H6763]] from the floor [[H7172]] of the temple [[H1004]] to [[H7023]] the ceiling, [[H5604]] and he covered [[H6823]] the floor [[H7172]] with cypress [[H1265]] boards. [[H6763]]

### 16
He partitioned off [[H1129]] the twenty [[H6242]] cubits [[H520]] at [[H4480]] the rear [[H3411]] of the temple [[H1004]] with cedar [[H730]] boards [[H6763]] from floor [[H7172]] to [[H5704]] ceiling [[H7023]] to form [[H1129]] within [the temple] [[H1004]] and inner sanctuary, [[H1687]] the Most Holy Place. [[H6944]]

### 17
And the main hall [[H1964]] in front of [this room] [[H6440]] was [[H1961]] forty [[H705]] cubits [long]. [[H520]]

### 18
The cedar [[H730]] paneling inside [[H6441]] the temple [[H1004]] was carved [[H4734]] with gourds [[H6497]] and open [[H6358]] flowers. [[H6731]] Everything [[H3605]] was cedar; [[H730]] not [[H369]] a stone [[H68]] could be seen. [[H7200]]

### 19
[Solomon] also prepared [[H3559]] the inner sanctuary [[H1687]] within [[H8432]] the temple [[H1004]] to set [[H5414]] the ark [[H727]] of the covenant [[H1285]] of the LORD [[H3068]] there. [[H8033]]

### 20
The inner [[H6440]] sanctuary [[H1687]] [was] twenty [[H6242]] cubits [[H520]] long, [[H753]] twenty [[H6242]] cubits [[H520]] wide, [[H7341]] and twenty [[H6242]] cubits [[H520]] high. [[H6967]] He overlaid [the inside] [[H6823]] with pure [[H5462]] gold, [[H2091]] and he also overlaid [[H6823]] the altar [[H4196]] of cedar. [[H730]]

### 21
So Solomon [[H8010]] overlaid [[H6823]] the inside [[H6441]] of the temple [[H1004]] with pure [[H5462]] gold, [[H2091]] and he extended [[H5674]] gold [[H2091]] chains [[H7572]] across the front [[H6440]] of the inner sanctuary, [[H1687]] which was overlaid [[H6823]] with gold. [[H2091]]

### 22
So he overlaid [[H6823]] with gold [[H2091]] the whole interior [[H3605]] of the temple, [[H1004]] until [[H5704]] everything [[H3605]] was completely finished. [[H8552]] He also overlaid [[H6823]] with gold [[H2091]] the entire [[H3605]] altar [[H4196]] that belonged to [[H834]] the inner sanctuary. [[H1687]]

### 23
In the inner sanctuary [[H1687]] he made [[H6213]] two [[H8147]] cherubim, [[H3742]] [each] ten [[H6235]] cubits [[H520]] high, [[H6967]] out of olive [[H8081]] wood. [[H6086]]

### 24
One wing [[H3671]] of the first [[H259]] cherub [[H3742]] [was] five [[H2568]] cubits long, [[H520]] and the other [[H8145]] wing [[H3671]] five [[H2568]] cubits [as well]. [[H520]] So the full [[H7098]] wingspan [[H3671]] [was] ten [[H6235]] cubits. [[H520]]

### 25
The second [[H8145]] cherub [[H3742]] [also measured] ten [[H6235]] cubits; [[H520]] both [[H8147]] cherubim [[H3742]] had the same [[H259]] size [[H4060]] and shape, [[H7095]]

### 26
and the height [[H6967]] of each [[H259]] cherub [[H3742]] [was] ten [[H6235]] cubits. [[H520]]

### 27
And he placed [[H5414]] the cherubim [[H3742]] inside [[H8432]] the innermost room [[H6442]] of the temple. [[H1004]] Since their [[H3742]] wings [[H3671]] were spread out, [[H6566]] the wing [[H3671]] of the first [cherub] [[H259]] touched [[H5060]] one wall, [[H7023]] while the wing [[H3671]] of the second [[H8145]] cherub [[H3742]] touched [[H5060]] the other [[H8145]] wall, [[H7023]] and in [[H413]] the middle [[H8432]] of the room [[H1004]] their wingtips [[H3671]] touched. [[H5060]]

### 28
He also overlaid [[H6823]] the cherubim [[H3742]] with gold. [[H2091]]

### 29
Then he carved [[H7049]] the walls [[H7023]] all [[H3605]] around [[H4524]] the temple, [[H1004]] in both the inner [[H6440]] and outer sanctuaries, [[H2435]] with carved [[H4734]] engravings [[H6603]] of cherubim, [[H3742]] palm trees, [[H8561]] and open [[H6358]] flowers. [[H6731]]

### 30
And [[H853]] he overlaid [[H6823]] the temple [[H1004]] floor [[H7172]] with gold [[H2091]] in both the inner [[H6441]] and outer sanctuaries. [[H2435]]

### 31
For the entrance [[H6607]] of the inner sanctuary, [[H1687]] [Solomon] constructed [[H6213]] doors [[H1817]] of olive [[H8081]] wood [[H6086]] with five-sided [[H2549]] doorposts. [[H4201]]

### 32
The double [[H8147]] doors [[H1817]] were made of olive [[H8081]] wood, [[H6086]] and he carved [[H7049]] into them [[H5921]] cherubim, [[H3742]] palm trees, [[H8561]] and open [[H6358]] flowers [[H6731]] and overlaid [[H6823]] the cherubim [[H3742]] and palm trees [[H8561]] with hammered gold. [[H2091]]

### 33
In the same way, [[H3651]] he made [[H6213]] four-sided [[H7243]] doorposts [[H4201]] of olive [[H8081]] wood [[H6086]] for the sanctuary [[H1964]] entrance. [[H6607]]

### 34
The two [[H8147]] doors [[H1817]] were made of cypress [[H1265]] wood, [[H6086]] [and] each had [[H259]] two [[H8147]] folding [[H1550]] panels. [[H6763]]

### 35
And he carved [into them] [[H7049]] cherubim, [[H3742]] palm trees, [[H8561]] and open [[H6358]] flowers [[H6731]] and overlaid them [[H6823]] with gold [[H2091]] hammered evenly [[H3474]] over [[H5921]] the carvings. [[H2707]]

### 36
[Solomon] built [[H1129]] the inner [[H6442]] courtyard [[H2691]] with three [[H7969]] rows [[H2905]] of dressed stone [[H1496]] and one row [[H2905]] of trimmed cedar [[H730]] beams. [[H3773]]

### 37
The foundation of the house [[H1004]] of the LORD [[H3068]] was laid [[H3245]] in the fourth [[H7243]] year [of Solomon's reign], [[H8141]] in the month [[H3391]] of Ziv. [[H2099]]

### 38
In his eleventh [[H259]] year [[H8141]] and eighth [[H8066]] month, [[H2320]] the month [[H3391]] of Bul, [[H945]] the temple [[H1004]] was finished [[H3615]] in every [[H3605]] detail [[H1697]] and according to every [[H3605]] specification. [[H4941]] So he built [the temple] [[H1129]] in seven [[H7651]] years. [[H8141]]
