### 1
Suddenly, [[H2009]] as Jeroboam [[H3379]] was standing [[H5975]] beside [[H5921]] the altar [[H4196]] to burn incense, [[H6999]] there came [[H935]] a man [[H376]] of God [[H430]] from Judah [[H3063]] to [[H413]] Bethel [[H1008]] by the word [[H1697]] of the LORD. [[H3068]]

### 2
And he cried out [[H7121]] against [[H5921]] the altar [[H4196]] by the word [[H1697]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] “O altar, [[H4196]] O altar, [[H4196]] this is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] says: [[H559]] ‘A son [[H1121]] named [[H8034]] Josiah [[H2977]] will be born [[H3205]] to the house [[H1004]] of David, [[H1732]] and upon you [[H5921]] he will sacrifice [[H2076]] the priests [[H3548]] of the high places [[H1116]] who burn incense [[H6999]] on you, [[H5921]] and human [[H120]] bones [[H6106]] will be burned [[H8313]] on you. [[H5921]]

### 3
That [[H1931]] day [[H3117]] [the man of God] gave [[H5414]] a sign, [[H4159]] saying, [[H559]] “This [[H2088]] is the sign [[H4159]] that [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] has spoken: [[H1696]] ‘Surely [[H2009]] the altar [[H4196]] will be split apart, [[H7167]] and the ashes [[H1880]] upon it [[H5921]] will be poured out.’” [[H8210]]

### 4
Now when [[H1961]] King [[H4428]] Jeroboam, [[H3379]] who was at [[H5921]] the altar [[H4196]] in  Bethel, [[H1008]] heard [[H8085]] the word [[H1697]] that [[H834]] the man [[H376]] of God [[H430]] had cried out [[H7121]] against [[H5921]] [it], [[H4196]] he stretched out [[H7971]] his hand [[H3027]] and said, [[H559]] “Seize him!” [[H8610]] But the hand [[H3027]] he stretched out [[H7971]] toward him [[H5921]] withered, [[H3001]] so that he could [[H3201]] not [[H3808]] pull it back. [[H7725]]

### 5
And the altar [[H4196]] was split apart, [[H7167]] and the ashes [[H1880]] poured out, [[H8210]] according to the sign [[H4159]] that [[H834]] the man [[H376]] of God [[H430]] had given [[H5414]] by the word [[H1697]] of the LORD. [[H3068]]

### 6
Then the king [[H4428]] responded [[H6030]] to [[H413]] the man [[H376]] of God, [[H430]] “Intercede [[H2470]] with [[H6440]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] and pray [[H6419]] that my [[H1157]] hand [[H3027]] may be restored.” [[H7725]] So the man [[H376]] of God [[H430]] interceded [[H2470]] with [[H6440]] the LORD, [[H3068]] and the king’s [[H4428]] hand [[H3027]] was restored [[H7725]] to him [[H413]] as [it was] [[H1961]] before. [[H7223]]

### 7
Then the king [[H4428]] said [[H1696]] to [[H413]] the man [[H376]] of God, [[H430]] “Come [[H935]] home [[H1004]] with me [[H854]] and refresh yourself, [[H5582]] and I will give [[H5414]] you  a reward.” [[H4991]]

### 8
But the man [[H376]] of God [[H430]] replied, [[H559]] “If [[H518]] you were to give [[H5414]] me half [[H2677]] your possessions, [[H1004]] I still would not [[H3808]] go [[H935]] with you, [[H5973]] nor [[H3808]] would I eat [[H398]] bread [[H3899]] or drink [[H8354]] water [[H4325]] in this [[H2088]] place. [[H4725]]

### 9
For [[H3588]] this is what [[H3651]] I was commanded [[H6680]] by the word [[H1697]] of the LORD: [[H3069]] ‘You must not [[H3808]] eat [[H398]] bread [[H3899]] or drink [[H8354]] water [[H4325]] or return [[H7725]] by the way [[H1870]] you came.’” [[H1980]]

### 10
So [the man of God] went [[H1980]] another [[H312]] way [[H1870]] and did not [[H3808]] return [[H7725]] by the way [[H1870]] he had come [[H935]] to [[H413]] Bethel. [[H1008]]

### 11
Now a certain [[H259]] old [[H2205]] prophet [[H5030]] was living [[H3427]] in Bethel, [[H1008]] and his sons [[H1121]] came [[H935]] and told [[H5608]] him all [[H3605]] the deeds [[H4639]] that [[H834]] the man [[H376]] of God [[H430]] had done [[H6213]] that day [[H3117]] in Bethel. [[H1008]] They also told [[H5608]] their father [[H1]] the words [[H1697]] that [[H834]] [the man] had spoken [[H1696]] to [[H413]] the king. [[H4428]]

### 12
“Which [[H335]] way [[H1870]] did he go?” [[H1980]] their father [[H1]] asked. [[H1696]] And his sons [[H1121]] had seen [[H7200]] the way [[H1870]] taken [[H1980]] by the man [[H376]] of God, [[H430]] who [[H834]] had come [[H935]] from Judah. [[H3063]]

### 13
So [the prophet] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] his sons, [[H1121]] “Saddle [[H2280]] the donkey [[H2543]] for me.”  Then they saddled [[H2280]] the donkey [[H2543]] for him,  and he mounted [[H7392]] it [[H5921]]

### 14
and went [[H1980]] after [[H310]] the man [[H376]] of God. [[H430]] He found him [[H4672]] sitting [[H3427]] under [[H8478]] an oak tree [[H424]] and asked, [[H559]] “Are you [[H859]] the man [[H376]] of God [[H430]] who [[H834]] came [[H935]] from Judah?” [[H3063]] “I [am],” [[H589]] he replied. [[H559]]

### 15
Then [the prophet] said [[H559]] to [the man of God], [[H413]] “Come [[H1980]] home [[H1004]] with me [[H854]] and eat [[H398]] some bread.” [[H3899]]

### 16
But [the man] replied, [[H559]] “I cannot [[H3808]] return [[H7725]] with you [[H854]] or eat [[H398]] bread [[H3899]] or drink [[H8354]] water [[H4325]] with you [[H854]] in this [[H2088]] place. [[H4725]]

### 17
For [[H3588]] I [[H413]] have been told [[H1697]] by the word [[H1697]] of the LORD: [[H3069]] ‘You must not [[H3808]] eat [[H398]] bread [[H3899]] or drink [[H8354]] water [[H4325]] there [[H8033]] or return [[H7725]] by the way [[H1870]] you came.’” [[H1980]]

### 18
Then [the prophet] replied, [[H559]] “I [[H589]] too [am] [[H1571]] a prophet [[H5030]] like you, [[H3644]] and an angel [[H4397]] spoke [[H1696]] to [[H413]] me by the word [[H1697]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] saying, [[H559]] ‘Bring him back [[H7725]] with you [[H854]] to [[H413]] your house, [[H1004]] so that he may eat [[H398]] bread [[H3899]] and drink [[H8354]] water.’” [[H4325]] The old prophet was lying [[H3584]] to him, 

### 19
but the man of God went back [[H7725]] with him, [[H854]] ate [[H398]] bread [[H3899]] in his house, [[H1004]] and drank [[H8354]] water. [[H4325]]

### 20
While they [[H1992]] were sitting [[H3427]] at [[H413]] the table, [[H7979]] the word [[H1697]] of the LORD [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] to [[H413]] the prophet [[H5030]] who [[H834]] had brought him back, [[H7725]]

### 21
and the prophet cried out [[H7121]] to [[H413]] the man [[H376]] of God [[H430]] who [[H834]] had come [[H935]] from Judah, [[H3063]] “This is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] says: [[H559]] ‘Because [[H3282]] you have defied [[H4784]] the word [[H6310]] of the LORD [[H3068]] and have not [[H3808]] kept [[H8104]] the commandment [[H4687]] that [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] gave you, [[H6680]]

### 22
but you went back [[H7725]] and ate [[H398]] bread [[H3899]] and drank [[H8354]] water [[H4325]] in the place [[H4725]] where [[H834]] He told [[H1696]] you [[H413]] not [[H408]] to do so, [[H398]] your body [[H5038]] shall never [[H3808]] reach [[H935]] the tomb [[H6913]] of your fathers.’” [[H1]]

### 23
And [[H1961]] after [[H310]] [the man of God] had finished eating [[H398]] and [[H310]] drinking, [[H8354]] the old prophet [[H5030]] who [[H834]] had brought him back [[H7725]] saddled [[H2280]] the donkey [[H2543]] for him. 

### 24
As he went on his way, [[H1980]] a lion [[H738]] met him [[H4672]] on the road [[H1870]] and killed him, [[H4191]] and his body [[H5038]] was [[H1961]] left lying [[H7993]] in the road, [[H1870]] with the donkey [[H2543]] and the lion [[H738]] standing [[H5975]] beside [[H681]] [it]. [[H5038]]

### 25
And there were [[H2009]] men [[H376]] passing by [[H5674]] who saw [[H7200]] the body [[H5038]] lying [[H7993]] in the road [[H1870]] with [[H853]] the lion [[H738]] standing [[H5975]] beside [[H681]] it, [[H5038]] and they went [[H935]] and reported this [[H1696]] in the city [[H5892]] where [[H834]] the old [[H2205]] prophet [[H5030]] lived. [[H3427]]

### 26
When the prophet [[H5030]] who [[H834]] had brought him back [[H7725]] from [[H4480]] his journey [[H1870]] heard this, [[H8085]] he said, [[H559]] “It [is] [[H1931]] the man [[H376]] of God [[H430]] who [[H834]] disobeyed [[H4784]] the command [[H6310]] of the LORD. [[H3068]] Therefore the LORD [[H3068]] has delivered him [[H5414]] to the lion, [[H738]] and it has mauled him [[H7665]] and killed him, [[H4191]] according to the word [[H1697]] that the LORD [[H3068]] had spoken [[H1696]] to him. 

### 27
Then the old prophet instructed [[H1696]] his sons, [[H1121]] “Saddle [[H2280]] the donkey for me.” [[H2543]] So they saddled [it], [[H2280]]

### 28
and he went [[H1980]] and found [[H4672]] the body [[H5038]] lying [[H7993]] in the road, [[H1870]] with the donkey [[H2543]] and the lion [[H738]] standing [[H5975]] beside [[H681]] [it]. [[H5038]] The lion [[H738]] had not [[H3808]] eaten [[H398]] the body [[H5038]] or mauled [[H7665]] the donkey. [[H2543]]

### 29
So the old prophet [[H5030]] lifted up [[H5375]] the body [[H5038]] of the man [[H376]] of God, [[H430]] laid [[H3240]] it on [[H413]] the donkey, [[H2543]] and brought it back [[H7725]] to his own [[H2205]] city [[H5892]] to mourn for him [[H5594]] and bury him. [[H6912]]

### 30
Then he laid [[H3240]] the body [[H5038]] in his own tomb, [[H6913]] and they lamented [[H5594]] over him, [[H5921]] “Oh, [[H1945]] my brother!” [[H251]]

### 31
After [[H310]] he had buried him, [[H6912]] [the prophet] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] his sons, [[H1121]] “When I die, [[H4191]] you must bury [[H6912]] me [[H853]] in the tomb [[H6913]] where [[H834]] the man [[H376]] of God [[H430]] is buried. [[H6912]] Lay [[H3240]] my bones [[H6106]] beside [[H681]] his bones, [[H6106]]

### 32
for [[H3588]] the message [[H1697]] that [[H834]] he cried out [[H7121]] by the word [[H1697]] of the LORD [[H3068]] against [[H5921]] the altar [[H4196]] in Bethel [[H1008]] and against [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] the shrines [[H1004]] on the high places [[H1116]] in the cities [[H5892]] of Samaria [[H8111]] will surely [[H1961]] come to pass.” [[H1961]]

### 33
Even after [[H310]] these [[H2088]] events, [[H1697]] Jeroboam [[H3379]] did not [[H3808]] repent [[H7725]] of his evil [[H7451]] ways, [[H1870]] but again [[H7725]] he appointed [[H6213]] priests [[H3548]] for the high places [[H1116]] from every class [[H7098]] of people. [[H5971]] He ordained [[H4390]] anyone who desired [[H2655]] to be [[H1961]] a priest [[H3548]] of the high places. [[H1116]]

### 34
And this [[H2088]] was [[H1961]] the sin [[H2403]] of the house [[H1004]] of Jeroboam [[H3379]] that led to its extermination [[H3582]] and destruction [[H8045]] from [[H5921]] the face [[H6440]] of the earth. [[H127]]
