###### 1
At that [[H1931]] time [[H6256]] Abijah [[H29]] son [[H1121]] of Jeroboam [[H3379]] became ill, [[H2470]]

###### 2
and Jeroboam [[H3379]] said [[H559]] to his wife, [[H802]] “Please [[H4994]] arise, [[H6965]] disguise yourself [[H8138]] so they will not [[H3808]] recognize [[H3045]] you [[H859]] as [my] wife, [[H802]] and go [[H1980]] to Shiloh. [[H7887]] For [[H2009]] Ahijah [[H281]] the prophet [[H5030]] is there; [[H8033]] it was he [[H1931]] who spoke [[H1696]] about my [[H5921]] kingship [[H4428]] over [[H5921]] this [[H2088]] people. [[H5971]]

###### 3
Take [[H3947]] with you [[H3027]] ten [[H6235]] loaves of bread, [[H3899]] some cakes, [[H5350]] and a jar [[H1228]] of honey, [[H1706]] and go [[H935]] to him. [[H413]] He [[H1931]] will tell [[H5046]] you  what [[H4100]] will become [[H1961]] of the boy.” [[H5288]]

###### 4
Jeroboam’s [[H3379]] wife [[H802]] did [[H6213]] as [instructed]; [[H3651]] she arose [[H6965]] and went [[H1980]] to Shiloh [[H7887]] and arrived [[H935]] at Ahijah’s [[H281]] house. [[H1004]] Now Ahijah [[H281]] could [[H3201]] not [[H3808]] see, [[H7200]] for [[H3588]] his eyes [[H5869]] were dim [[H6965]] because of his age. [[H7869]]

###### 5
But the LORD [[H3068]] had said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Ahijah, [[H281]] “Behold, [[H2009]] the wife [[H802]] of Jeroboam [[H3379]] is coming [[H935]] to ask [[H1875]] you [[H5973]] about [[H413]] her son, [[H1121]] for [[H3588]] he [[H1931]] is ill. [[H2470]] You are to say [[H1696]] such [[H2090]] and such [[H2088]] to her, [[H413]] because [[H1961]] when she arrives, [[H935]] she [[H1931]] will be disguised. [[H5234]]

###### 6
So [[H1961]] when Ahijah [[H281]] heard [[H8085]] the sound [[H6963]] of her feet [[H7272]] entering [[H935]] the door, [[H6607]] he said, [[H559]] “Come in, [[H935]] wife [[H802]] of Jeroboam! [[H3379]] Why [[H4100]] are you [[H859]] disguised? [[H5234]] For I [[H595]] [have been] sent [[H7971]] to you [[H413]] [with] bad [news]. [[H7186]]

###### 7
Go, [[H1980]] tell [[H559]] Jeroboam [[H3379]] that this is what [[H3541]] the LORD, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] says: [[H559]] ‘I raised you up [[H7311]] from among [[H8432]] the people [[H5971]] and appointed you [[H5414]] ruler [[H5057]] over [[H5921]] My people [[H5971]] Israel. [[H3478]]

###### 8
I tore the kingdom [[H4467]] away [[H7167]] from the house [[H1004]] of David [[H1732]] and gave it [[H5414]] to you.  But you were [[H1961]] not [[H3808]] like My servant [[H5650]] David, [[H1732]] who [[H834]] kept [[H8104]] My commandments [[H4687]] and [[H834]] followed [[H1980]] Me with all [[H3605]] his heart, [[H3824]] doing [[H6213]] only [[H7535]] [what was] right [[H3477]] in My eyes. [[H5869]]

###### 9
You have done [[H6213]] more evil [[H7489]] than all [[H3605]] who [[H834]] came [[H1961]] before you. [[H6440]] You have proceeded [[H1980]] to make [[H6213]] for yourself  other [[H312]] gods [[H430]] and cast images [[H4541]] to provoke [[H3707]] Me, [[H853]] and you have flung Me [[H7993]] behind [[H310]] your back. [[H1458]]

###### 10
Because of all this, [[H3651]] behold, [[H2005]] I am bringing [[H935]] disaster [[H7451]] on [[H413]] the house [[H1004]] of Jeroboam: [[H3379]] I will cut off [[H3772]] from Jeroboam [[H3379]] every male, [[H8366]] both slave [[H6113]] and free [[H5800]] in Israel; [[H3478]] I will sweep away [[H1197]] the house [[H1004]] of Jeroboam [[H3379]] as [[H834]] one sweeps away [[H1197]] dung [[H1557]] until [[H5704]] it is gone! [[H8552]]

###### 11
Anyone belonging to Jeroboam [[H3379]] who dies [[H4191]] in the city [[H5892]] will be eaten [[H398]] by dogs, [[H3611]] and anyone who dies [[H4191]] in the field [[H7704]] will be eaten [[H398]] by the birds [[H5775]] of the air. [[H8064]] For [[H3588]] the LORD [[H3068]] has spoken.’ [[H1696]]

###### 12
As for you, [[H859]] get up [[H6965]] and go [[H1980]] home. [[H1004]] When your feet [[H7272]] enter [[H935]] the city, [[H5892]] the child [[H3206]] will die. [[H4191]]

###### 13
All [[H3605]] Israel [[H3478]] will mourn [[H5594]] for him  and bury [[H6912]] him, [[H853]] for [[H3588]] this [is] [[H2088]] the only one [[H905]] belonging to Jeroboam [[H3379]] who shall come [[H935]] to [[H413]] the grave, [[H6913]] because [[H3282]] only in him  has the LORD, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] found [[H4672]] any [[H1697]] good [[H2896]] in the house [[H1004]] of Jeroboam. [[H3379]]

###### 14
Moreover, the LORD [[H3068]] will raise up [[H6965]] for Himself  a king [[H4428]] over [[H5921]] Israel [[H3478]] who [[H834]] will cut off [[H3772]] the house [[H1004]] of Jeroboam. [[H3379]] This [[H2088]] is the day— [[H3117]] yes, even [[H1571]] today! [[H6258]]

###### 15
For the LORD [[H3068]] will strike [[H5221]] Israel [[H3478]] as [[H834]] a reed [[H7070]] is shaken [[H5110]] in the water. [[H4325]] He will uproot [[H5428]] Israel [[H3478]] from [[H5921]] this [[H2063]] good [[H2896]] land [[H127]] that [[H834]] He gave [[H5414]] their fathers [[H1]] and scatter them [[H2219]] beyond [[H5676]] the Euphrates, [[H5104]] because [[H3282]] they have made [[H6213]] their Asherah poles, [[H842]] provoking [[H3707]] the LORD {to anger}. [[H3068]]

###### 16
And He will give [[H5414]] Israel over [[H3478]] on account [[H1558]] of the sins [[H2403]] Jeroboam [[H3379]] has committed [[H2398]] and has caused Israel [[H3478]] to commit.” [[H2398]]

###### 17
Then Jeroboam’s [[H3379]] wife [[H802]] got up [[H6965]] and departed [[H1980]] for [[H935]] Tirzah, [[H8656]] and as soon as she [[H1931]] stepped over [[H935]] the threshold [[H5592]] of the house, [[H1004]] the boy [[H5288]] died. [[H4191]]

###### 18
And they buried [[H6912]] him, [[H853]] and all [[H3605]] Israel [[H3478]] mourned [[H5594]] for him,  according to the word [[H1697]] the LORD [[H3068]] had spoken [[H1696]] through [[H3027]] His servant [[H5650]] Ahijah [[H281]] the prophet. [[H5030]]

###### 19
As for the rest [[H3499]] of the acts [[H1697]] of Jeroboam, [[H3379]] how [[H834]] he waged war [[H3898]] and how [[H834]] he reigned, [[H4427]] they are indeed [[H2009]] written [[H3789]] in [[H5921]] the Book [[H5612]] of the Chronicles [[H1697]] of the Kings [[H4428]] of Israel. [[H3478]]

###### 20
And the length [[H3117]] of Jeroboam’s [[H3379]] reign [[H4427]] [was] twenty-two [[H6242]] years, [[H8141]] and he rested [[H7901]] with [[H5973]] his fathers, [[H1]] and his son [[H1121]] Nadab [[H5070]] reigned [[H4427]] in his place. [[H8478]]

###### 21
Meanwhile, Rehoboam [[H7346]] son [[H1121]] of Solomon [[H8010]] reigned [[H4427]] in Judah. [[H3063]] [He] [[H7346]] was forty-one [[H705]] years [[H8141]] old [[H1121]] when he became king, [[H4427]] and he reigned [[H4427]] seventeen [[H7651]] years [[H8141]] in Jerusalem, [[H3389]] the city [[H5892]] the LORD [[H3068]] had chosen [[H977]] from all [[H3605]] the tribes [[H7626]] of Israel [[H3478]] in which [[H834]] to put [[H7760]] His Name. [[H8034]] His mother's [[H517]] name [[H8034]] was Naamah [[H5279]] the Ammonite. [[H5985]]

###### 22
And Judah [[H3063]] did [[H6213]] evil [[H7451]] in the sight [[H5869]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] and by the sins [[H2403]] they committed [[H2398]] they provoked Him to jealous anger [[H7065]] more than all [[H3605]] their fathers [[H1]] had done. [[H6213]]

###### 23
They [[H1992]] also [[H1571]] built [[H1129]] for themselves [[H1992]] high places, [[H1116]] sacred pillars, [[H4676]] and Asherah poles [[H842]] on [[H5921]] every [[H3605]] high [[H1364]] hill [[H1389]] and under [[H8478]] every [[H3605]] green [[H7488]] tree. [[H6086]]

###### 24
There were [[H1961]] even [[H1571]] male cult prostitutes [[H6945]] in the land. [[H776]] They imitated [[H6213]] all [[H3605]] the abominations [[H8441]] of the nations [[H1471]] the LORD [[H3068]] had driven out [[H3423]] before [[H6440]] the Israelites. [[H1121]]

###### 25
In the fifth [[H2549]] year [[H8141]] of Rehoboam's [[H7346]] reign, [[H4428]] Shishak [[H7895]] king [[H4428]] of Egypt [[H4714]] came up [[H5927]] and attacked [[H5921]] Jerusalem. [[H3389]]

###### 26
He seized [[H3947]] the treasuries [[H214]] of the house [[H1004]] of the LORD [[H3068]] [and] [[H214]] of the royal [[H4428]] palace. [[H1004]] He took [[H3947]] everything, [[H3605]] including [[H3947]] all [[H3605]] the gold [[H2091]] shields [[H4043]] that [[H834]] Solomon [[H8010]] had made. [[H6213]]

###### 27
So King [[H4428]] Rehoboam [[H7346]] made [[H6213]] bronze [[H5178]] shields [[H4043]] in their place [[H8478]] and committed [them] [[H6485]] to [[H5921]] the care [[H3027]] of the captains [[H8269]] of the guard [[H7323]] on duty [[H8104]] at the entrance [[H6607]] to the royal [[H4428]] palace. [[H1004]]

###### 28
And [[H1961]] whenever [[H1767]] the king [[H4428]] entered [[H935]] the house [[H1004]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] the royal escorts [[H7323]] bore the shields [[H5375]] and then took them back [[H7725]] to [[H413]] the guardroom. [[H7323]]

###### 29
As for the rest [[H3499]] of the acts [[H1697]] of Rehoboam, [[H7346]] along with all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] he did, [[H6213]] [are] they [[H1992]] not [[H3808]] written [[H3789]] in [[H5921]] the Book [[H5612]] of the Chronicles [[H1697]] of the Kings [[H4428]] of Judah? [[H3063]]

###### 30
There was [[H1961]] war [[H4421]] between [[H996]] Rehoboam [[H7346]] and Jeroboam [[H3379]] throughout [[H3605]] [their] days. [[H3117]]

###### 31
And Rehoboam [[H7346]] rested [[H7901]] with [[H5973]] his fathers [[H1]] and was buried [[H6912]] with [[H5973]] his fathers [[H1]] in the City [[H5892]] of David; [[H1732]] his mother’s [[H517]] name [[H8034]] was Naamah [[H5279]] the Ammonite. [[H5985]] And his son [[H1121]] Abijam [[H38]] became king [[H4427]] in his place. [[H8478]]
