### 1
Then the word [[H1697]] of the LORD [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] to [[H413]] Jehu [[H3058]] son [[H1121]] of Hanani [[H2607]] against [[H5921]] Baasha, [[H1201]] saying: [[H559]]

### 2
“Even [[H3282]] though [[H834]] I lifted you [[H7311]] out [[H4480]] of the dust [[H6083]] and made [[H5414]] you ruler [[H5057]] over [[H5921]] My people [[H5971]] Israel, [[H3478]] you have walked [[H1980]] in the way [[H1870]] of Jeroboam [[H3379]] and have caused My people [[H5971]] Israel [[H3478]] to sin [[H2398]] and to provoke Me to anger [[H3707]] by their sins. [[H2403]]

### 3
So now [[H2005]] I will consume [[H1197]] Baasha [[H1201]] and his house, [[H1004]] and I will make [[H5414]] your house [[H1004]] like that [[H1004]] of Jeroboam [[H3379]] son [[H1121]] of Nebat: [[H5028]]

### 4
Anyone belonging to Baasha [[H1201]] who dies [[H4191]] in the city [[H5892]] will be eaten [[H398]] by dogs, [[H3611]] and anyone who dies [[H4191]] in the field [[H7704]] will be eaten [[H398]] by the birds [[H5775]] of the air.” [[H8064]]

### 5
As for the rest [[H3499]] of the acts [[H1697]] of Baasha, [[H1201]] along with his accomplishments [[H834]] and might, [[H1369]] [are] they [[H1992]] not [[H3808]] written [[H3789]] in [[H5921]] the Book [[H5612]] of the Chronicles [[H1697]] of the Kings [[H4428]] of Israel? [[H3478]]

### 6
And Baasha [[H1201]] rested [[H7901]] with [[H5973]] his fathers [[H1]] and was buried [[H6912]] in Tirzah, [[H8656]] and his son [[H1121]] Elah [[H425]] reigned [[H4427]] in his place. [[H8478]]

### 7
Moreover, [[H1571]] the word [[H1697]] of the LORD [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] through [[H3027]] the prophet [[H5030]] Jehu [[H3058]] son [[H1121]] of Hanani [[H2607]] against [[H413]] Baasha [[H1201]] [and] [[H413]] his house, [[H1004]] because of [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] the evil [[H7451]] he had done [[H6213]] in the sight [[H5869]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] provoking Him to anger [[H3707]] with the work [[H4639]] of his hands [[H3027]] and becoming [[H1961]] like the house [[H1004]] of Jeroboam, [[H3379]] and also [[H5921]] because [[H834]] Baasha struck down [[H5221]] the house of Jeroboam. [[H853]]

### 8
In the twenty-sixth [[H6242]] year [[H8141]] of Asa's [[H609]] reign [[H4428]] over Judah, [[H3063]] Elah [[H425]] son [[H1121]] of Baasha [[H1201]] became king [[H4427]] of [[H5921]] Israel, [[H3478]] and he reigned in Tirzah [[H8656]] two years. [[H8141]]

### 9
However, while Elah [[H1931]] was in Tirzah [[H8656]] getting drunk [[H8354]] in the house [[H1004]] of Arza [[H777]] the steward [[H5921]] of [his] household [[H1004]] in Tirzah, [[H8656]] [Elah's] servant [[H5650]] Zimri, [[H2174]] the commander [[H8269]] of half [[H4276]] his chariots, [[H7393]] conspired [[H7194]] against him. [[H5921]]

### 10
So in the twenty-seventh [[H6242]] year [[H8141]] of Asa's [[H609]] reign [[H4428]] over Judah, [[H3063]] Zimri [[H2174]] went in, [[H935]] struck Elah down, [[H5221]] and killed him. [[H4191]] And Zimri reigned [[H4427]] in his place. [[H8478]]

### 11
As soon as [[H1961]] [Zimri] began to reign [[H4427]] and was seated [[H3427]] on [[H5921]] the throne, [[H3678]] he struck down [[H5221]] the entire [[H3605]] household [[H1004]] of Baasha. [[H1201]] He did not [[H3808]] leave [[H7604]] a single male, [[H8366]] whether a kinsman [[H1350]] or friend. [[H7453]]

### 12
So Zimri [[H2174]] destroyed [[H8045]] the entire [[H3605]] household [[H1004]] of Baasha, [[H1201]] according to the word [[H1697]] the LORD [[H3069]] had spoken [[H1696]] against [[H413]] Baasha [[H1201]] through [[H3027]] Jehu [[H3058]] the prophet. [[H5030]]

### 13
This happened because of [[H413]] all [[H3605]] the sins [[H2403]] Baasha [[H1201]] [and] [[H2403]] his son [[H1121]] Elah [[H425]] had committed [[H2398]] and had caused Israel [[H3478]] to commit, [[H2398]] provoking [[H3707]] the LORD, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of Israel, {to anger} [[H3478]] with their worthless idols. [[H1892]]

### 14
As for the rest [[H3499]] of the acts [[H1697]] of Elah, [[H425]] along with all [[H3605]] his accomplishments, [[H834]] [are] they [[H1992]] not [[H3808]] written [[H3789]] in [[H5921]] the Book [[H5612]] of the Chronicles [[H1697]] of the Kings [[H4428]] of Israel? [[H3478]]

### 15
In the twenty-seventh [[H6242]] year [[H8141]] of Asa's [[H609]] reign [[H4428]] over Judah, [[H3063]] Zimri [[H2174]] reigned [[H4427]] in Tirzah [[H8656]] for seven [[H7651]] days. [[H3117]] Now the troops [[H5971]] were encamped [[H2583]] against [[H5921]] Gibbethon [[H1405]] of the Philistines, [[H6430]]

### 16
and the people [[H5971]] in the camp [[H2583]] heard [[H8085]] that Zimri [[H2174]] had not only conspired [[H7194]] but had also [[H1571]] struck down [[H5221]] the king. [[H4428]] So there in the camp [[H4264]] that very [[H1931]] day, [[H3117]] all [[H3605]] Israel [[H3478]] proclaimed Omri, [[H6018]] the commander [[H8269]] of the army, [[H6635]] king [[H4427]] over [[H5921]] Israel. [[H3478]]

### 17
Then Omri [[H6018]] and [[H5973]] all [[H3605]] the Israelites [[H3478]] marched up [[H5927]] from Gibbethon [[H1405]] and besieged [[H6696]] Tirzah. [[H8656]]

### 18
When Zimri [[H2174]] saw [[H7200]] that [[H3588]] the city [[H5892]] was captured, [[H3920]] he entered [[H935]] the citadel [[H759]] of the royal [[H4428]] palace [[H1004]] and burned it down [[H8313]] on himself. [[H5921]] So he died [[H4191]]

### 19
because of [[H5921]] the sins [[H2403]] he had committed, [[H2398]] doing [[H6213]] evil [[H7451]] in the sight [[H5869]] of the LORD [[H3068]] and following [[H1980]] the example [[H1870]] of Jeroboam [[H3379]] and the sin [[H2403]] he had committed [[H6213]] and had caused Israel [[H3478]] to commit. [[H2398]]

### 20
As for the rest [[H3499]] of the acts [[H1697]] of Zimri [[H2174]] and the treason [[H7195]] he committed, [[H7194]] [are] they [[H1992]] not [[H3808]] written [[H3789]] in [[H5921]] the Book [[H5612]] of the Chronicles [[H1697]] of the Kings [[H4428]] of Israel? [[H3478]]

### 21
At that time [[H227]] the people [[H5971]] of Israel [[H3478]] were divided: [[H2505]] Half [[H2677]] of the people [[H5971]] supported [[H1961]] Tibni [[H8402]] son [[H1121]] of Ginath [[H1527]] as king, [[H4427]] and half [[H2677]] supported [[H310]] Omri. [[H6018]]

### 22
But the followers [[H5971]] of Omri [[H6018]] proved stronger [[H2388]] than those [[H5971]] of Tibni [[H8402]] son [[H1121]] of Ginath. [[H1527]] So Tibni [[H8402]] died [[H4191]] and Omri [[H6018]] became king. [[H4427]]

### 23
In the thirty-first [[H7970]] year [[H8141]] of Asa's [[H609]] reign [[H4428]] over Judah, [[H3063]] Omri [[H6018]] became king [[H4427]] of [[H5921]] Israel, [[H3478]] [and he reigned] twelve [[H8147]] years, [[H8141]] six [[H8337]] [of them] [[H8141]] in Tirzah. [[H8656]]

### 24
He bought [[H7069]] the hill [[H2022]] of Samaria [[H8111]] from [[H853]] Shemer [[H8106]] for two talents [[H3603]] of silver [[H3701]] and built [a city] [[H1129]] [there], [[H2022]] calling [[H7121]] [it] [[H5892]] Samaria [[H8111]] after [[H5921]] the name [[H8034]] of Shemer, [[H8106]] who had owned [[H113]] the hill. [[H2022]]

### 25
But Omri [[H6018]] did [[H6213]] evil [[H7451]] in the sight [[H5869]] of the LORD [[H3068]] and acted more wickedly [[H7489]] than all [[H3605]] who [were] [[H834]] before him. [[H6440]]

### 26
For he walked [[H1980]] in all [[H3605]] the ways [[H1870]] of Jeroboam [[H3379]] son [[H1121]] of Nebat [[H5028]] and in his sins, [[H2403]] which [[H834]] he caused Israel [[H3478]] to commit, [[H2398]] provoking [[H3707]] the LORD, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] {to anger} [[H853]] with their worthless idols. [[H1892]]

### 27
As for the rest [[H3499]] of the acts [[H1697]] of Omri, [[H6018]] along with his accomplishments [[H834]] and the might [[H1369]] he exercised, [[H6213]] [are] they [[H1992]] not [[H3808]] written [[H3789]] in [[H5921]] the Book [[H5612]] of the Chronicles [[H1697]] of the Kings [[H4428]] of Israel? [[H3478]]

### 28
And Omri [[H6018]] rested [[H7901]] with [[H5973]] his fathers [[H1]] and was buried [[H6912]] in Samaria, [[H8111]] and his son [[H1121]] Ahab [[H256]] reigned [[H4427]] in his place. [[H8478]]

### 29
In the thirty-eighth [[H7970]] year [[H8141]] of Asa's [[H609]] reign [[H4428]] over Judah, [[H3063]] Ahab [[H256]] son [[H1121]] of Omri [[H6018]] became king [[H4427]] of [[H5921]] Israel, [[H3478]] and he reigned [[H4427]] in Samaria [[H8111]] twenty-two [[H6242]] years. [[H8141]]

### 30
However, Ahab [[H256]] son [[H1121]] of Omri [[H6018]] did [[H6213]] evil [[H7451]] in the sight [[H5869]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] more than all [[H3605]] who [[H834]] were before him. [[H6440]]

### 31
And as if it were [[H1961]] not enough [[H7043]] for him to walk [[H1980]] in the sins [[H2403]] of Jeroboam [[H3379]] son [[H1121]] of Nebat, [[H5028]] he even married [[H3947]] Jezebel [[H348]] the daughter [[H1323]] of Ethbaal [[H856]] king [[H4428]] of the Sidonians, [[H6722]] and then he proceeded [[H1980]] to serve [[H5647]] and worship [[H7812]] [Baal]. 

### 32
First, [Ahab] set up [[H6965]] an altar [[H4196]] for Baal [[H1168]] in the temple [[H1004]] of Baal [[H1168]] that [[H834]] he had built [[H1129]] in Samaria. [[H8111]]

### 33
Then [he] [[H256]] set up [[H6213]] an Asherah pole. [[H842]] Thus Ahab [[H256]] did [[H6213]] more [[H3254]] to provoke [[H3707]] the LORD, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of Israel, {to anger} [[H3478]] than all [[H3605]] the kings [[H4428]] of Israel [[H3478]] before him. [[H6440]]

### 34
In [Ahab's] days, [[H3117]] Hiel [[H2419]] the Bethelite [[H1017]] built [[H1129]] Jericho. [[H3405]] At the cost of Abiram [[H48]] his firstborn [[H1060]] he laid its foundation, [[H3245]] and at the cost of Segub [[H7687]] his youngest [[H6810]] he set up [[H5324]] its gates, [[H1817]] according to the word [[H1697]] the LORD [[H3068]] had spoken [[H1696]] through [[H3027]] Joshua [[H3091]] son [[H1121]] of Nun.
