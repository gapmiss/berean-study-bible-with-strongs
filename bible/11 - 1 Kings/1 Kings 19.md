###### 1
Now Ahab [[H256]] told [[H5046]] Jezebel [[H348]] everything [[H3605]] that [[H834]] Elijah [[H452]] had done [[H6213]] and how [[H834]] he had killed [[H2026]] all [[H3605]] the prophets [[H5030]] with the sword. [[H2719]]

###### 2
So Jezebel [[H348]] sent [[H7971]] a messenger [[H4397]] to [[H413]] Elijah, [[H452]] saying, [[H559]] “May the gods [[H430]] deal with me, [[H6213]] and ever so [[H3541]] severely, [[H3254]] if [[H3588]] by this time [[H6256]] tomorrow [[H4279]] I do not make [[H7760]] your life [[H5315]] like the lives [[H5315]] of [those you killed]!” [[H259]]

###### 3
And Elijah was afraid [[H7200]] and ran [[H1980]] for [[H413]] his life. [[H5315]] When he came [[H935]] to Beersheba [[H884]] in Judah, [[H3063]] he left [[H3240]] his servant [[H5288]] there, [[H8033]]

###### 4
while he himself [[H1931]] traveled on [[H1980]] a day’s [[H3117]] journey [[H1870]] into the wilderness. [[H4057]] He sat down [[H3427]] under [[H8478]] a [[H259]] broom tree [[H7574]] and prayed [[H7592]] that he [[H5315]] might die. [[H4191]] “I have had enough, [[H7227]] LORD,” [[H3068]] he said. [[H559]] “Take [[H3947]] my life, [[H5315]] for [[H3588]] I am [[H595]] no [[H3808]] better [[H2896]] than my fathers.” [[H1]]

###### 5
Then he lay down [[H7901]] under [[H8478]] the broom tree [[H7574]] and fell asleep. [[H3462]] Suddenly [[H2009]] an angel [[H4397]] touched [[H5060]] him  and said, [[H559]] “Get up [[H6965]] and eat.” [[H398]]

###### 6
And he looked around, [[H5027]] and there [[H2009]] by his head [[H4763]] was a cake of bread [[H5692]] baked over hot coals, [[H7529]] and a jar [[H6835]] of water. [[H4325]] So he ate [[H398]] and drank [[H8354]] and lay down [[H7901]] again. [[H7725]]

###### 7
A second [time] [[H8145]] the angel [[H4397]] of the LORD [[H3068]] returned [[H7725]] and touched [[H5060]] him,  saying, [[H559]] “Get up [[H6965]] and eat, [[H398]] or the journey [[H1870]] will be too much [[H7227]] for you.” [[H4480]]

###### 8
So he got up [[H6965]] and ate [[H398]] and drank. [[H8354]] And strengthened [[H3581]] by that [[H1931]] food, [[H396]] he walked [[H1980]] forty [[H705]] days [[H3117]] and forty [[H705]] nights [[H3915]] until he reached [[H5704]] Horeb, [[H2722]] the mountain [[H2022]] of God. [[H430]]

###### 9
There [[H8033]] Elijah entered [[H935]] a cave [[H4631]] and spent the night. [[H3885]] And the word [[H1697]] of the LORD [[H3068]] came to him, [[H413]] saying, [[H559]] “What [[H4100]] are you doing here, [[H6311]] Elijah?” [[H452]]

###### 10
“I have been very zealous [[H7065]] for the LORD, [[H3069]] the God [[H430]] of Hosts,” [[H6635]] he replied, [[H559]] “but [[H3588]] the Israelites [[H1121]] have forsaken [[H5800]] Your covenant, [[H1285]] torn down [[H2040]] Your altars, [[H4196]] and killed [[H2026]] Your prophets [[H5030]] with the sword. [[H2719]] I [[H589]] am the only one [[H905]] left, [[H3498]] and they are seeking [[H1245]] my life {as well}.” [[H5315]]

###### 11
Then [the LORD] said, [[H559]] “Go out [[H3318]] and stand [[H5975]] on the mountain [[H2022]] before [[H6440]] the LORD. [[H3068]] Behold, [[H2009]] the LORD [[H3068]] is about to pass by.” [[H5674]] And a great [[H1419]] and mighty [[H2389]] wind [[H7307]] tore into [[H6561]] the mountains [[H2022]] and shattered [[H7665]] the rocks [[H5553]] before [[H6440]] the LORD, [[H3068]] but the LORD [[H3068]] was not [[H3808]] in the wind. [[H7307]] After [[H310]] the wind [[H7307]] there was an earthquake, [[H7494]] but the LORD [[H3068]] was not [[H3808]] in the earthquake. [[H7494]]

###### 12
After [[H310]] the earthquake [[H7494]] there was a fire, [[H784]] but the LORD [[H3068]] was not [[H3808]] in the fire. [[H784]] And after [[H310]] the fire [[H784]] came a still, [[H1827]] small [[H1851]] voice. [[H6963]]

###### 13
When Elijah [[H452]] heard it, [[H8085]] he wrapped [[H3874]] his face [[H6440]] in his cloak [[H155]] and went out [[H3318]] and stood [[H5975]] at the mouth [[H6607]] of the cave. [[H4631]] Suddenly [[H2009]] a voice [came] [[H6963]] to him [[H413]] and said, [[H559]] “What [[H4100]] are you doing here, [[H6311]] Elijah?” [[H452]]

###### 14
“I have been very zealous [[H7065]] for the LORD, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of Hosts,” [[H6635]] he replied, [[H559]] “but [[H3588]] the Israelites [[H1121]] have forsaken [[H5800]] Your covenant, [[H1285]] torn down [[H2040]] Your altars, [[H4196]] and killed [[H2026]] Your prophets [[H5030]] with the sword. [[H2719]] I [[H589]] am the only one [[H905]] left, [[H3498]] and they are seeking [[H1245]] my life {as well}.” [[H5315]]

###### 15
Then the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H559]] to him, [[H413]] “Go [[H1980]] back [[H7725]] by the way you came, [[H1870]] to the Desert [[H4057]] of Damascus. [[H1834]] When you arrive, [[H935]] you are to anoint [[H4886]] Hazael [[H2371]] as king [[H4428]] over [[H5921]] Aram. [[H758]]

###### 16
You are also to anoint [[H4886]] Jehu [[H3058]] son [[H1121]] of Nimshi [[H5250]] as king [[H4428]] over [[H5921]] Israel [[H3478]] and Elisha [[H477]] son [[H1121]] of Shaphat [[H8202]] from Abel-meholah [[H65]] to succeed you [[H8478]] as prophet. [[H5030]]

###### 17
Then [[H1961]] Jehu [[H3058]] will put to death [[H4191]] whoever escapes [[H4422]] the sword [[H2719]] of Hazael, [[H2371]] and Elisha [[H477]] will put to death [[H4191]] whoever escapes [[H4422]] the sword [[H2719]] of Jehu. [[H3058]]

###### 18
Nevertheless, I have reserved [[H7604]] seven [[H7651]] thousand [[H505]] in Israel— [[H3478]] all [[H3605]] whose [[H834]] knees [[H1290]] have not [[H3808]] bowed [[H3766]] to Baal [[H1168]] and [whose] [[H3605]] mouths [[H6310]] have not [[H3808]] kissed [[H5401]] him.” 

###### 19
So Elijah departed [[H1980]] and found [[H4672]] Elisha [[H477]] son [[H1121]] of Shaphat. [[H8202]] He [[H1931]] was plowing [[H2790]] with twelve [[H8147]] teams [[H6776]] [of oxen], [[H6440]] and he [[H1931]] was with the twelfth [team]. [[H8147]] Elijah [[H452]] passed [[H5674]] by him [[H413]] and threw [[H7993]] his cloak [[H155]] around him. [[H413]]

###### 20
So Elisha left [[H5800]] the oxen, [[H1241]] ran [[H7323]] after [[H310]] Elijah, [[H452]] and said, [[H559]] “Please [[H4994]] let me kiss [[H5401]] my father [[H1]] and mother [goodbye], [[H517]] and then I will follow [[H1980]] you.” [[H310]] “Go on [[H1980]] back,” [[H7725]] [Elijah] replied, [[H559]] “for [[H3588]] what [[H4100]] have I done [[H6213]] to you?” 

###### 21
So [Elisha] turned back [[H7725]] from him, [[H310]] took [[H3947]] his pair [[H6776]] of oxen, [[H1241]] and slaughtered them. [[H2076]] With the oxen’s [[H1241]] equipment, [[H3627]] he cooked [[H1310]] the meat [[H1320]] and gave [[H5414]] it to the people, [[H5971]] and they ate. [[H398]] Then he set out [[H6965]] to follow [[H1980]] and serve [[H8334]] Elijah. [[H452]]
