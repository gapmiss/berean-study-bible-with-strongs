### 29
And God [[H430]] gave [[H5414]] Solomon [[H8010]] wisdom, [[H2451]] exceedingly [[H3966]] deep [[H7235]] insight, [[H8394]] and understanding [[H3820]] beyond measure, [[H7341]] like the sand [[H2344]] on [[H5921]] the seashore. [[H8193]]

### 30
Solomon’s [[H8010]] wisdom [[H2451]] was greater than [[H7235]] [that] [[H2451]] of all [[H3605]] the men [[H1121]] of the East, [[H6924]] greater than all [[H3605]] the wisdom [[H2451]] of Egypt. [[H4714]]

### 31
He was wiser [[H2449]] than all [[H3605]] men— [[H120]] wiser than Ethan [[H387]] the Ezrahite, [[H250]] and wiser than Heman, [[H1968]] Calcol, [[H3633]] and Darda, [[H1862]] the sons [[H1121]] of Mahol. [[H4235]] And his fame [[H8034]] spread [[H1961]] throughout [[H3605]] the surrounding [[H5439]] nations. [[H1471]]

### 32
Solomon composed [[H1696]] three [[H7969]] thousand [[H505]] proverbs, [[H4912]] and his songs [[H7892]] numbered [[H1961]] a thousand [[H505]] and five. [[H2568]]

### 33
He spoke [[H1696]] of trees, [[H6086]] from [[H4480]] the cedar [[H730]] in Lebanon [[H3844]] to [[H5704]] the hyssop [[H231]] growing [[H3318]] in the wall, [[H7023]] and he taught [[H1696]] about [[H5921]] animals, [[H929]] birds, [[H5775]] reptiles, [[H7431]] and fish. [[H1709]]

### 34
So men of all [[H3605]] nations [[H5971]] came [[H935]] to listen [[H8085]] to Solomon’s [[H8010]] wisdom, [[H2451]] sent by all [[H3605]] the kings [[H4428]] of the earth [[H776]] when they heard [[H8085]] of his wisdom. [[H2451]]
