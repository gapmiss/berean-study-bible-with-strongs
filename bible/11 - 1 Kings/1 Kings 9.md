###### 1
Now [[H1961]] when Solomon [[H8010]] had finished [[H3615]] building [[H1129]] the house [[H1004]] of the LORD [[H3068]] and [[H853]] the royal [[H4428]] palace, [[H1004]] and had achieved [[H6213]] all [[H3605]] that [[H834]] [he] [[H8010]] had desired [[H2837]] to do, [[H2654]]

###### 2
the LORD [[H3068]] appeared [[H7200]] to [[H413]] [him] [[H8010]] a second [time], [[H8145]] as [[H834]] He had appeared [[H7200]] to him [[H413]] at Gibeon. [[H1391]]

###### 3
And the LORD [[H3068]] said [[H559]] to him, [[H413]] “I have heard [[H8085]] your prayer [[H8605]] and petition [[H8467]] before Me. [[H6440]] I have consecrated [[H6942]] this [[H2088]] temple [[H1004]] you have built [[H1129]] by putting [[H7760]] My Name [[H8034]] there [[H8033]] forever; [[H5704]] My eyes [[H5869]] and My heart [[H3820]] will be [[H1961]] there [[H8033]] for all time. [[H3605]]

###### 4
And as for you, [[H859]] if [[H518]] you walk [[H1980]] before [[H6440]] Me as [[H834]] your father [[H1]] David [[H1732]] walked, [[H1980]] with a heart [[H3824]] of integrity [[H8537]] and uprightness, [[H3476]] doing [[H6213]] all [[H3605]] I have commanded you, [[H6680]] and if you keep [[H8104]] My statutes [[H2706]] and ordinances, [[H4941]]

###### 5
then I will establish [[H6965]] your royal [[H4467]] throne [[H3678]] over [[H5921]] Israel forever, [[H3478]] as [[H834]] I promised [[H1696]] your father [[H1]] David [[H1732]] when I said, [[H559]] ‘You will never [[H3808]] fail [[H3772]] to have a man [[H376]] on [[H5921]] the throne [[H3678]] of Israel.’ [[H3478]]

###### 6
But if [[H518]] indeed [[H7725]] you [[H859]] or your sons [[H1121]] turn away [[H7725]] from following Me [[H310]] and do not [[H3808]] keep [[H8104]] the commandments [[H4687]] [and] statutes [[H2708]] I have set [[H5414]] before you, [[H6440]] and if you go off [[H1980]] to serve [[H5647]] and worship [[H7812]] other [[H312]] gods, [[H430]]

###### 7
then I will cut off [[H3772]] Israel [[H3478]] from [[H5921]] the land [[H127]] I have given [[H5414]] them,  and this [[H853]] temple [[H1004]] that [[H834]] I have sanctified [[H6942]] for My name [[H8034]] I will banish [[H7971]] from [[H5921]] My presence. [[H6440]] Then Israel [[H3478]] will become [[H1961]] an object of scorn [[H4912]] and ridicule [[H8148]] among all [[H3605]] peoples. [[H5971]]

###### 8
And this [[H2088]] temple [[H1004]] will now [[H1961]] become a heap of rubble. [[H5945]] All [[H3605]] who pass [[H5674]] by it [[H5921]] will be appalled [[H8074]] and will hiss [[H8319]] and say, [[H559]] ‘Why [[H5921]] has the LORD [[H3068]] done [[H6213]] such a thing [[H3602]] to this [[H2063]] land [[H776]] and to this [[H2088]] temple?’ [[H1004]]

###### 9
And [others] will answer, [[H559]] ‘Because [[H5921]] they have forsaken [[H5800]] the LORD [[H3068]] their God [[H430]] who [[H834]] brought [[H3318]] their fathers [[H1]] out [[H776]] of Egypt, [[H4714]] and have embraced [[H2388]] other [[H312]] gods, [[H430]] worshiping [[H7812]] and serving them. [[H5647]] Because of [[H5921]] this, [[H3651]] the LORD [[H3068]] has brought [[H935]] all [[H3605]] this [[H2063]] disaster [[H7451]] upon them. [[H5921]]

###### 10
Now [[H1961]] at the end [[H7097]] of the twenty [[H6242]] years [[H8141]] during which [[H834]] Solomon [[H8010]] built [[H1129]] these two [[H8147]] houses, [[H1004]] the house [[H1004]] of the LORD [[H3068]] and the royal [[H4428]] palace, [[H1004]]

###### 11
King [[H4428]] Solomon [[H8010]] gave [[H5414]] twenty [[H6242]] towns [[H5892]] in the land [[H776]] of Galilee [[H1551]] to Hiram [[H2438]] king [[H4428]] of Tyre, [[H6865]] who had supplied [[H5375]] him [[H8010]] with cedar [[H730]] and cypress [[H1265]] logs [[H6086]] and gold [[H2091]] for his every [[H3605]] desire. [[H2656]]

###### 12
So Hiram [[H2438]] went out [[H3318]] from Tyre [[H6865]] to look over [[H7200]] the towns [[H5892]] that [[H834]] Solomon [[H8010]] had given [[H5414]] him,  but he was not [[H3808]] pleased with [[H3474]] them. [[H5869]]

###### 13
“What [[H4100]] are these [[H428]] towns [[H5892]] you have given [[H5414]] me,  my brother?” [[H251]] asked [Hiram], [[H559]] and he called [[H7121]] them  the land [[H776]] of Cabul, [[H3521]] as they are [called] to [[H5704]] this [[H2088]] day. [[H3117]]

###### 14
And Hiram [[H2438]] had sent [[H7971]] the king [[H4428]] 120 [[H3967]] talents [[H3603]] of gold. [[H2091]]

###### 15
This [[H2088]] is the account [[H1697]] of the forced labor [[H4522]] that [[H834]] King [[H4428]] Solomon [[H8010]] imposed [[H5927]] to build [[H1129]] the house [[H1004]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] his own palace, [[H1004]] the supporting terraces, [[H4407]] and [[H853]] the wall [[H2346]] of Jerusalem, [[H3389]] as well as [[H853]] Hazor, [[H2674]] Megiddo, [[H4023]] and Gezer. [[H1507]]

###### 16
Pharaoh [[H6547]] king [[H4428]] of Egypt [[H4714]] had attacked [[H5927]] and captured [[H3920]] Gezer. [[H1507]] He had set it [[H8313]] on fire, [[H784]] killed [[H2026]] the Canaanites [[H3669]] who lived [[H3427]] in the city, [[H5892]] and given [[H5414]] it as a dowry [[H7964]] to his daughter, [[H1323]] Solomon’s [[H8010]] wife. [[H802]]

###### 17
So Solomon [[H8010]] rebuilt [[H1129]] Gezer, [[H1507]] Lower [[H8481]] Beth-horon, [[H1032]]

###### 18
Baalath, [[H1191]] and [[H853]] Tamar [[H8412]] in the Wilderness [[H4057]] [of Judah], [[H776]]

###### 19
as well [[H853]] as all [[H3605]] the store [[H4543]] cities [[H5892]] that [[H834]] Solomon [[H8010]] had [[H1961]] for his chariots [[H7393]] and horses— [[H6571]] whatever [[H834]] [he] [[H8010]] desired [[H2837]] to build [[H1129]] in Jerusalem, [[H3389]] Lebanon, [[H3844]] and throughout [[H3605]] the land [[H776]] of his dominion. [[H4475]]

###### 20
As for all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] who remained [[H3498]] of [[H4480]] the Amorites, [[H567]] Hittites, [[H2850]] Perizzites, [[H6522]] Hivites, [[H2340]] and Jebusites [[H2983]] (the people who [[H834]] were [[H1992]] not [[H3808]] Israelites [[H1121]] )— [[H3478]]

###### 21
their descendants [[H1121]] who [[H834]] remained [[H3498]] in the land, [[H776]] those whom [[H834]] the Israelites [[H1121]] were unable [[H3808]] to destroy completely— [[H2763]] Solomon [[H8010]] conscripted these people [[H5927]] to be forced [[H4522]] laborers, [[H5647]] as they are to [[H5704]] this [[H2088]] day. [[H3117]]

###### 22
But Solomon [[H8010]] did not [[H3808]] consign [[H5414]] any of the Israelites [[H1121]] to slavery, [[H5650]] because [[H3588]] they [were] [[H1992]] his men [[H376]] of war, [[H4421]] his servants, [[H5650]] his officers, [[H8269]] his captains, [[H7991]] and the commanders [[H8269]] of his chariots [[H7393]] and cavalry. [[H6571]]

###### 23
[They] [[H428]] [were also] the chief [[H8269]] officers [[H5324]] over [[H5921]] Solomon’s [[H8010]] projects: [[H4399]] 550 [[H2572]] supervisors over [[H7287]] the people [[H5971]] who did [[H6213]] the work. [[H4399]]

###### 24
As soon as [[H389]] Pharaoh’s [[H6547]] daughter [[H1323]] had come up [[H5927]] from the City [[H5892]] of David [[H1732]] to [[H413]] the palace [[H1004]] that [[H834]] [Solomon] had built [[H1129]] for her,  he [[H227]] built [[H1129]] the supporting terraces. [[H4407]]

###### 25
Three [[H7969]] times [[H6471]] a year [[H8141]] Solomon [[H8010]] offered [[H5927]] burnt offerings [[H5930]] and peace offerings [[H8002]] on [[H5921]] the altar [[H4196]] he had built [[H1129]] for the LORD, [[H3068]] burning incense [[H6999]] with them [[H854]] before [[H6440]] the LORD. [[H3068]] So he completed [[H7999]] the temple. [[H1004]]

###### 26
King [[H4428]] Solomon [[H8010]] also assembled [[H6213]] a fleet of ships [[H590]] at Ezion-geber, [[H6100]] which [[H834]] is near [[H854]] Eloth [[H359]] [in] [[H776]] Edom, [[H123]] on [[H5921]] the shore [[H8193]] of the Red [[H5488]] Sea. [[H3220]]

###### 27
And Hiram [[H2438]] sent [[H7971]] his servants, [[H5650]] men [[H582]] who knew [[H3045]] the sea, [[H3220]] [to serve] in the fleet [[H590]] with [[H5973]] Solomon’s [[H8010]] servants. [[H5650]]

###### 28
They sailed [[H935]] to Ophir [[H211]] and imported [[H3947]] gold [[H2091]] from there— [[H8033]] 420 [[H702]] talents— [[H3603]] and delivered [[H935]] it to [[H413]] Solomon. [[H8010]]
