### 1
Now Elijah [[H452]] the Tishbite, [[H8664]] who was among the settlers [[H8453]] of Gilead, [[H1568]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Ahab, [[H256]] “As surely as the LORD, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] lives, [[H2416]] I stand [[H5975]] before Him, [[H6440]] and in these [[H428]] years [[H8141]] there will be [[H1961]] neither [[H518]] dew [[H2919]] nor rain [[H4306]] except [[H3588]] at [[H6310]] my word! [[H1697]]

### 2
Then a revelation [[H1697]] from the LORD [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] to [Elijah]: [[H413]]

### 3
“Leave [[H1980]] here, [[H2088]] turn [[H6437]] eastward, [[H6924]] and hide yourself [[H5641]] by the Brook [[H5158]] Cherith, [[H3747]] east of [[H834]] the Jordan. [[H3383]]

### 4
And [[H1961]] you are to drink [[H8354]] from the brook, [[H5158]] and I have commanded [[H6680]] the ravens [[H6158]] to feed you [[H3557]] there.” [[H8033]]

### 5
So [Elijah] did [[H6213]] what the LORD [[H3068]] had told him, [[H1697]] and he went [[H1980]] and lived [[H3427]] by the Brook [[H5158]] Cherith, [[H3747]] east of [[H834]] the Jordan. [[H3383]]

### 6
The ravens [[H6158]] would bring [[H935]] him  bread [[H3899]] and meat [[H1320]] in the morning [[H1242]] and evening, [[H6153]] and he would drink [[H8354]] from [[H4480]] the brook. [[H5158]]

### 7
Some time later, however, [[H1961]] the brook [[H5158]] dried up [[H3001]] because [[H3588]] there had been [[H1961]] no [[H3808]] rain [[H1653]] in the land. [[H776]]

### 8
Then the word [[H1697]] of the LORD [[H3068]] came [[H1961]] to [Elijah]: [[H413]]

### 9
“Get up, [[H6965]] go [[H1980]] to Zarephath [[H6886]] of Sidon, [[H6721]] and stay [[H3427]] there. [[H8033]] Behold, [[H2009]] I have commanded [[H6680]] a widow [[H490]] there [[H8033]] to provide for you.” [[H3557]]

### 10
So Elijah got up [[H6965]] and went [[H1980]] to Zarephath. [[H6886]] When he arrived [[H935]] at [[H413]] the city [[H5892]] gate, [[H6607]] there [[H8033]] was a widow [[H490]] gathering [[H7197]] sticks. [[H6086]] Elijah called [[H7121]] to [[H413]] her and said, [[H559]] “Please [[H4994]] bring [[H3947]] me  a little [[H4592]] water [[H4325]] in a cup, [[H3627]] so that I may drink. [[H8354]]

### 11
And as she was going [[H1980]] to get [it], [[H3947]] he called [[H7121]] to her [[H413]] and said, [[H559]] “Please [[H4994]] bring [[H3947]] me  a piece [[H6595]] of bread.” [[H3899]]

### 12
But she replied, [[H559]] “As surely as the LORD [[H3068]] your God [[H430]] lives, [[H2416]] I  have [[H3426]] no [[H518]] bread— [[H4580]] only [[H3588]] a handful [[H4393]] of flour [[H7058]] in a jar [[H3537]] and a little [[H4592]] oil [[H8081]] in a jug. [[H6835]] Look, [[H2005]] I am gathering [[H7197]] a couple of [[H8147]] sticks [[H6086]] to go in [[H935]] and prepare [[H6213]] for myself  and my son, [[H1121]] so that we may eat it [[H398]] and die. [[H4191]]

### 13
“Do not [[H408]] be afraid,” [[H3372]] Elijah [[H452]] said [[H559]] to her. [[H413]] “Go [[H935]] and do [[H6213]] as you have said. [[H1697]] But [[H389]] first [[H7223]] make me [[H6213]] a small [[H6996]] cake of bread [[H5692]] from [what you have], [[H8033]] and bring it out [[H3318]] to me.  Afterward, [[H314]] make [some] [[H6213]] for yourself  and your son, [[H1121]]

### 14
for [[H3588]] this is what [[H3541]] the LORD [[H3068]] God [[H430]] of Israel [[H3478]] says: [[H559]] ‘The jar [[H3537]] of flour [[H7058]] will not [[H3808]] be exhausted [[H3615]] and the jug [[H6835]] of oil [[H8081]] will not [[H3808]] run dry [[H2637]] until [[H5704]] the day [[H3117]] the LORD [[H5414]] sends [[H5414]] rain [[H1653]] on [[H5921]] the face [[H6440]] of the earth.” [[H127]]

### 15
So she went [[H1980]] and did [[H6213]] according to the word [[H1697]] of Elijah, [[H452]] and the woman, [[H1931]] Elijah, [[H1931]] and her household [[H1004]] had food to eat [[H398]] every day. [[H3117]]

### 16
The jar [[H3537]] of flour [[H7058]] was not [[H3808]] exhausted [[H3615]] and the jug [[H6835]] of oil [[H8081]] did not [[H3808]] run dry, [[H2638]] according to the word [[H1697]] the LORD [[H3068]] had spoken [[H1696]] through [[H3027]] Elijah. [[H452]]

### 17
Later, [[H310]] the son [[H1121]] of the woman [[H802]] who owned [[H1172]] the house [[H1004]] became ill, [[H2470]] and his sickness [[H2483]] grew [[H1961]] severe, [[H2389]] until [[H5704]] no [[H3808]] breath [[H5397]] remained [[H3498]] in him. 

### 18
“O man [[H376]] of God,” [[H430]] said [the woman] [[H559]] to [[H413]] Elijah, [[H452]] “what [[H4100]] have you done  to me?  Have you come [[H935]] to remind me [[H2142]] of my iniquity [[H5771]] and cause the death [[H4191]] of my son?” [[H1121]]

### 19
But Elijah said [[H559]] to her, [[H413]] “Give [[H5414]] me your son.” [[H1121]] So he took him [[H3947]] from her arms, [[H2436]] carried him [[H5927]] to [[H413]] the upper room [[H5944]] where [[H834]] he [[H1931]] was staying, [[H3427]] and laid [[H7901]] him on [[H5921]] his own bed. [[H4296]]

### 20
Then he cried out [[H7121]] to [[H413]] the LORD, [[H3069]] “O LORD [[H3069]] my God, [[H430]] have You also [[H1571]] brought tragedy [[H7489]] on [[H5921]] this widow [[H490]] who has opened her home to me [[H1481]] by causing [[H4191]] her son {to die}?” [[H1121]]

### 21
Then he stretched himself out [[H4058]] over [[H5921]] the child [[H3206]] three [[H7969]] times [[H6471]] and cried out [[H7121]] to [[H413]] the LORD, [[H3068]] “O LORD [[H3068]] my God, [[H430]] please [[H4994]] let this [[H2088]] boy’s [[H3206]] life [[H5315]] return [[H7725]] to [[H5921]] him!” [[H7130]]

### 22
And the LORD [[H3068]] listened [[H8085]] to the voice [[H6963]] of Elijah, [[H452]] and the child’s [[H3206]] life [[H5315]] returned [[H7725]] to [[H5921]] him, [[H7130]] and he lived. [[H2421]]

### 23
Then Elijah [[H452]] took [[H3947]] the child, [[H3206]] brought him down [[H3381]] from [[H4480]] the upper room [[H5944]] into the house, [[H1004]] and gave him [[H5414]] to his mother. [[H517]] “Look, [[H7200]] your son [[H1121]] is alive,” [[H2416]] Elijah [[H452]] declared. [[H559]]

### 24
Then the woman [[H802]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Elijah, [[H452]] “Now [[H6258]] I know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] you [[H859]] are a man [[H376]] of God [[H430]] and that the word [[H1697]] of the LORD [[H3068]] from your mouth [[H6310]] is truth.” [[H571]]
