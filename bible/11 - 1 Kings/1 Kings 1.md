###### 1
Now King [[H4428]] David [[H1732]] was old [[H2204]] and advanced [[H935]] in years, [[H3117]] and though they covered him [[H3680]] with blankets, [[H899]] he could not [[H3808]] get warm. [[H3179]]

###### 2
So his servants [[H5650]] said [[H559]] to him,  “Let us search for [[H1245]] a young [[H5291]] virgin [[H1330]] for our lord [[H113]] the king, [[H4428]] to attend [[H5975]] to [[H6440]] [him] [[H4428]] and [[H1961]] care [[H5532]] for him  and lie [[H7901]] by his side [[H2436]] {to keep} him [[H113]] warm.” [[H2552]]

###### 3
Then they searched [[H1245]] throughout [[H3605]] Israel [[H3478]] for a beautiful [[H3303]] girl, [[H5291]] and they found [[H4672]] Abishag [[H49]] the Shunammite [[H7767]] and brought [[H935]] her [[H853]] to the king. [[H4428]]

###### 4
The girl [[H5291]] was unsurpassed [[H5704]] in beauty, [[H3303]] and she [[H1961]] cared [[H5532]] for the king [[H4428]] and served him, [[H8334]] but he [[H4428]] had no [[H3808]] relations with her. [[H3045]]

###### 5
At that time Adonijah, [[H138]] [David's] son [[H1121]] by Haggith, [[H2294]] began to exalt himself, [[H5375]] saying, [[H559]] “I [[H589]] will be king!” [[H4427]] And he acquired [[H6213]] chariots [[H7393]] and horsemen [[H6571]] and fifty [[H2572]] men [[H376]] to run [[H7323]] ahead of him. [[H6440]]

###### 6
(His father [[H1]] had never [[H3808]] once reprimanded [[H6087]] him by saying, [[H559]] “Why [[H4069]] do you act [[H6213]] this way?” [[H3602]] He [was] [[H1931]] also [[H1571]] very [[H3966]] handsome, [[H2896]] born [[H3205]] next after [[H310]] Absalom.) [[H53]]

###### 7
So [Adonijah] [[H1961]] conferred [[H1697]] with [[H5973]] Joab [[H3097]] son [[H1121]] of Zeruiah [[H6870]] and with [[H5973]] Abiathar [[H54]] the priest, [[H3548]] who supported [[H5826]] [him]. [[H138]]

###### 8
But Zadok [[H6659]] the priest, [[H3548]] Benaiah [[H1141]] son [[H1121]] of Jehoiada, [[H3077]] Nathan [[H5416]] the prophet, [[H5030]] Shimei, [[H8096]] Rei, [[H7472]] and David’s [[H1732]] mighty men [[H1368]] would not [[H3808]] join [[H5973]] Adonijah. [[H138]]

###### 9
And Adonijah [[H138]] sacrificed [[H2076]] sheep, [[H6629]] oxen, [[H1241]] and fattened calves [[H4806]] near the stone of Zoheleth, [[H5973]] which [[H834]] is next to [[H681]] En-rogel. [[H5883]] He invited [[H7121]] all [[H3605]] his royal [[H4428]] brothers [[H251]] and all [[H3605]] the men [[H376]] of Judah [[H3063]] who were servants [[H5650]] of the king. [[H4428]]

###### 10
But [[H853]] he did not [[H3808]] invite [[H7121]] Nathan [[H5416]] the prophet, [[H5030]] Benaiah, [[H1141]] the mighty men, [[H1368]] or his brother [[H251]] Solomon. [[H8010]]

###### 11
Then Nathan [[H5416]] said [[H559]] to [[H413]] Bathsheba [[H1339]] the mother [[H517]] of Solomon, [[H8010]] “Have you not [[H3808]] heard [[H8085]] that [[H3588]] Adonijah [[H138]] son [[H1121]] of Haggith [[H2294]] has become king, [[H4427]] and our lord [[H113]] David [[H1732]] does not [[H3808]] know it? [[H3045]]

###### 12
Now [[H6258]] please, [[H4994]] come [[H1980]] and let me advise [[H3289]] you. [[H6098]] Save [[H4422]] your own life [[H5315]] and [[H853]] the life [[H5315]] of your son [[H1121]] Solomon. [[H8010]]

###### 13
Go [[H1980]] at once [[H935]] to King [[H4428]] David [[H1732]] and say, [[H559]] ‘My lord [[H113]] the king, [[H4428]] did you [[H859]] not [[H3808]] swear [[H7650]] to your maidservant, [[H519]] “Surely [[H3588]] your son [[H1121]] Solomon [[H8010]] will reign [[H4427]] after me, [[H310]] and he [[H1931]] will sit [[H3427]] on [[H5921]] my throne”? [[H3678]] Why then [[H4069]] has Adonijah [[H138]] become king? [[H4427]]

###### 14
Then, [[H2009]] while you are still [[H5750]] there [[H8033]] speaking [[H1696]] with [[H5973]] the king, [[H4428]] I will [[H589]] come in [[H935]] after you [[H310]] and confirm [[H4390]] your words.” [[H1697]]

###### 15
So Bathsheba [[H1339]] went [[H935]] to see [[H413]] the king [[H4428]] in his bedroom. [[H2315]] Since the king [[H4428]] was very [[H3966]] old, [[H2204]] Abishag [[H49]] the Shunammite [[H7767]] was serving [[H8334]] him. [[H4428]]

###### 16
And Bathsheba [[H1339]] bowed down [[H6915]] in homage [[H7812]] to the king, [[H4428]] [who] [[H4428]] asked, [[H559]] “What [[H4100]] is your desire?” 

###### 17
“My lord,” [[H113]] she replied, [[H559]] “you yourself [[H859]] swore [[H7650]] to your maidservant [[H519]] by the LORD [[H3068]] your God: [[H430]] ‘Surely [[H3588]] your son [[H1121]] Solomon [[H8010]] will reign [[H4427]] after me, [[H310]] and he [[H1931]] will sit [[H3427]] on [[H5921]] my throne.’ [[H3678]]

###### 18
But now, [[H6258]] behold, [[H2009]] Adonijah [[H138]] has become king, [[H4427]] and you, [[H6258]] my lord [[H113]] the king, [[H4428]] did not [[H3808]] know it. [[H3045]]

###### 19
And he has sacrificed [[H2076]] an abundance [[H7230]] of oxen, [[H7794]] fattened calves, [[H4806]] and sheep, [[H6629]] and has invited [[H7121]] all the other [[H3605]] sons [[H1121]] of the king, [[H4428]] as well as Abiathar [[H54]] the priest [[H3548]] and Joab [[H3097]] the commander [[H8269]] of the army. [[H6635]] But he did not [[H3808]] invite [[H7121]] your servant [[H5650]] Solomon. [[H8010]]

###### 20
And as for you, [[H859]] my lord [[H113]] the king, [[H4428]] the eyes [[H5869]] of all [[H3605]] Israel [[H3478]] [are] upon you [[H5921]] to tell [[H5046]] them  who [[H4310]] will sit [[H3427]] on [[H5921]] the throne [[H3678]] of my lord [[H113]] the king [[H4428]] after him. [[H310]]

###### 21
Otherwise, when my lord [[H113]] the king [[H4428]] rests [[H7901]] with [[H5973]] his fathers, [[H1]] I [[H589]] and my son [[H1121]] Solomon [[H8010]] will be counted [[H1961]] as criminals.” [[H2400]]

###### 22
And just then, [[H2009]] while [Bathsheba] was still [[H5750]] speaking [[H1696]] with [[H5973]] the king, [[H4428]] Nathan [[H5416]] the prophet [[H5030]] arrived. [[H935]]

###### 23
So the king [[H4428]] was told, [[H5046]] “Nathan [[H5416]] the prophet [[H5030]] is here.” [[H2009]] And [Nathan] went [[H935]] before [[H6440]] the king [[H4428]] and bowed [[H7812]] facedown [[H5921]] to [him]. [[H4428]]

###### 24
“My lord [[H113]] the king,” [[H4428]] said [[H559]] Nathan, [[H5416]] “did you [[H859]] say, [[H559]] ‘Adonijah [[H138]] will reign [[H4427]] after me, [[H310]] and he [[H1931]] will sit [[H3427]] on [[H5921]] my throne’? [[H3678]]

###### 25
For [[H3588]] today [[H3117]] he has gone down [[H3381]] and sacrificed [[H2076]] an abundance [[H7230]] of oxen, [[H7794]] fattened calves, [[H4806]] and sheep, [[H6629]] and has invited [[H7121]] all [[H3605]] the sons [[H1121]] of the king, [[H4428]] the commanders [[H8269]] of the army, [[H6635]] and Abiathar [[H54]] the priest. [[H3548]] And behold, [[H2009]] they are eating [[H398]] and drinking [[H8354]] before him, [[H6440]] saying, [[H559]] Long live [[H2421]] King [[H4428]] Adonijah! [[H138]]

###### 26
But  me [[H589]] your servant [[H5650]] he did not [[H3808]] invite, [[H7121]] nor Zadok [[H6659]] the priest, [[H3548]] nor Benaiah [[H1141]] son [[H1121]] of Jehoiada, [[H3077]] nor your servant [[H5650]] Solomon. [[H8010]]

###### 27
Has [[H518]] my lord [[H113]] the king [[H4428]] let this [[H2088]] happen [[H1961]] without [[H3808]] informing [[H3045]] your servant [[H5650]] who [[H4310]] should sit [[H3427]] on [[H5921]] the throne [[H3678]] after [[H310]] my lord [[H113]] the king?” [[H4428]]

###### 28
Then King [[H4428]] David [[H1732]] said, [[H6030]] “Call in [[H7121]] Bathsheba [[H1339]] for me.”  So she came [[H935]] into the king’s [[H4428]] presence [[H6440]] and stood [[H5975]] before him. [[H6440]]

###### 29
And the king [[H4428]] swore an oath, [[H7650]] saying, [[H559]] “As surely as the LORD [[H3068]] lives, [[H2416]] who [[H834]] has redeemed [[H6299]] my life [[H5315]] from all [[H3605]] distress, [[H6869]]

###### 30
I will carry out [[H6213]] this very [[H2088]] day [[H3117]] exactly [[H3588]] what [[H834]] I swore [[H7650]] to you  by the LORD, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of Israel: [[H3478]] Surely [[H3588]] your son [[H1121]] Solomon [[H8010]] will reign [[H4427]] after me, [[H310]] and he [[H1931]] will sit [[H3427]] on [[H5921]] my throne [[H3678]] in my place.” [[H8478]]

###### 31
Bathsheba [[H1339]] bowed [[H6915]] facedown [[H639]] in homage [[H7812]] to the king [[H4428]] and said, [[H559]] “May my lord [[H113]] King [[H4428]] David [[H1732]] live [[H2421]] forever!” [[H5769]]

###### 32
Then King [[H4428]] David [[H1732]] said, [[H559]] “Call in [[H7121]] for me  Zadok [[H6659]] the priest, [[H3548]] Nathan [[H5416]] the prophet, [[H5030]] and Benaiah [[H1141]] son [[H1121]] of Jehoiada.” [[H3077]] So they came [[H935]] before [[H6440]] the king. [[H4428]]

###### 33
“Take [[H3947]] my servants [[H5650]] with you,” [[H5973]] said [[H559]] the king. [[H4428]] “Set [[H7392]] my son [[H1121]] Solomon [[H8010]] on [[H5921]] my own mule [[H6506]] and take him down [[H3381]] to [[H413]] Gihon. [[H1521]]

###### 34
There [[H8033]] Zadok [[H6659]] the priest [[H3548]] and Nathan [[H5416]] the prophet [[H5030]] are to anoint [[H4886]] him [[H853]] king [[H4428]] over [[H5921]] Israel. [[H3478]] You are to blow [[H8628]] the trumpet [[H7782]] and declare, [[H559]] ‘Long live [[H2421]] King [[H4428]] Solomon!’ [[H8010]]

###### 35
Then you shall go up [[H5927]] with him, [[H310]] and he is to come [[H935]] and sit [[H3427]] on [[H5921]] my throne [[H3678]] and [[H1931]] reign [[H4427]] in my place. [[H8478]] For I have appointed [[H6680]] him [[H854]] to be [[H1961]] ruler [[H5057]] over [[H5921]] Israel [[H3478]] and [[H5921]] Judah.” [[H3063]]

###### 36
“Amen,” [[H543]] replied [[H6030]] Benaiah [[H1141]] son [[H1121]] of Jehoiada. [[H3077]] “May the LORD, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of my lord [[H113]] the king, [[H4428]] so [[H3651]] declare it. [[H559]]

###### 37
Just as [[H834]] the LORD [[H3068]] was [[H1961]] with [[H5973]] my lord [[H113]] the king, [[H4428]] so [[H3651]] may He be [[H1961]] with [[H5973]] Solomon [[H8010]] and make his throne [[H3678]] even greater [[H1431]] than [that] [[H3678]] of my lord [[H113]] King [[H4428]] David.” [[H1732]]

###### 38
Then Zadok [[H6659]] the priest, [[H3548]] Nathan [[H5416]] the prophet, [[H5030]] and Benaiah [[H1141]] son [[H1121]] of Jehoiada, [[H3077]] along with the Cherethites [[H3746]] and Pelethites, [[H6432]] went down [[H3381]] and set [[H7392]] Solomon [[H8010]] on [[H5921]] King [[H4428]] David’s [[H1732]] mule, [[H6506]] and they escorted [[H1980]] him [[H853]] to [[H5921]] Gihon. [[H1521]]

###### 39
Zadok [[H6659]] the priest [[H3548]] took [[H3947]] the horn [[H7161]] of oil [[H8081]] from [[H4480]] the tabernacle [[H168]] and anointed [[H4886]] Solomon. [[H8010]] Then they blew [[H8628]] the trumpet, [[H7782]] and all [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] proclaimed, [[H559]] “Long live [[H2421]] King [[H4428]] Solomon!” [[H8010]]

###### 40
All [[H3605]] the people [[H5971]] followed him, [[H5927]] playing [[H2490]] flutes [[H2485]] and rejoicing [[H8056]] with such a great [[H1419]] joy [[H8057]] that the earth [[H776]] was split [[H1234]] by the sound. [[H6963]]

###### 41
Now Adonijah [[H138]] and all [[H3605]] his guests [[H7121]] were finishing [[H3615]] their feast [[H398]] when they heard [[H8085]] the sound [[H6963]] of the trumpet. [[H7782]] “Why [is] [[H4069]] the city [[H7151]] in such a loud [[H6963]] uproar?” [[H1993]] asked [[H559]] Joab. [[H3097]]

###### 42
As he was [[H5750]] speaking, [[H1696]] suddenly [[H2009]] Jonathan [[H3129]] the son [[H1121]] of Abiathar [[H54]] the priest [[H3548]] arrived. [[H935]] “Come in,” [[H935]] said [[H559]] Adonijah, [[H138]] “for [[H3588]] you [[H859]] [are] a man [[H376]] of valor. [[H2428]] You must be bringing good [[H2896]] news.” [[H1319]]

###### 43
“Not at all,” [[H61]] Jonathan [[H3129]] replied. [[H6030]] “Our lord [[H113]] King [[H4428]] David [[H1732]] has made Solomon [[H8010]] king. [[H4427]]

###### 44
And with Solomon, [[H854]] the king [[H4428]] has sent [[H7971]] Zadok [[H6659]] the priest, [[H3548]] Nathan [[H5416]] the prophet, [[H5030]] and Benaiah [[H1141]] son [[H1121]] of Jehoiada, [[H3077]] along with Cherethites, [[H3774]] and Pelethites, [[H6432]] and they have set [[H7392]] him [[H853]] on [[H5921]] the king’s [[H4428]] mule. [[H6506]]

###### 45
Zadok [[H6659]] the priest [[H3548]] and Nathan [[H5416]] the prophet [[H5030]] have anointed [[H4886]] him king [[H4428]] at Gihon, [[H1521]] and they have gone up [[H5927]] from there [[H8033]] with rejoicing [[H8056]] that rings out [[H1949]] in the city. [[H7151]] That is [[H1931]] the noise [[H6963]] you hear. [[H8085]]

###### 46
Moreover, [[H1571]] Solomon [[H8010]] has taken his seat [[H3427]] on [[H5921]] the royal [[H4410]] throne. [[H3678]]

###### 47
The king’s [[H4428]] servants [[H5650]] have also [[H1571]] gone [[H935]] to congratulate [[H1288]] our lord [[H113]] King [[H4428]] David, [[H1732]] saying, [[H559]] ‘May your God [[H430]] make the name [[H8034]] of Solomon [[H8010]] more famous [[H3190]] than your own name, [[H8034]] and may He make his throne [[H3678]] greater [[H1431]] than your throne.’ [[H3678]] And the king [[H4428]] has bowed in worship [[H7812]] on [[H5921]] his bed, [[H4904]]

###### 48
saying, [[H559]] ‘May the LORD [[H3068]] God [[H430]] of Israel [[H3478]] be praised! [[H1288]] Today [[H3117]] He [[H834]] has provided [one] [[H5414]] to sit [[H3427]] on [[H5921]] my throne, [[H3678]] and my eyes [[H5869]] have seen [it].’” [[H7200]]

###### 49
At this, all [[H3605]] the guests [[H7121]] of Adonijah [[H138]] arose [[H6965]] in terror [[H2729]] and scattered. [[H1980]]

###### 50
But Adonijah, [[H138]] in fear [[H3372]] of [[H6440]] Solomon, [[H8010]] got up [[H6965]] and went [[H1980]] to take hold [[H2388]] of the horns [[H7161]] of the altar. [[H4196]]

###### 51
It was reported [[H5046]] to Solomon: [[H8010]] “Behold, [[H2009]] Adonijah [[H138]] fears [[H3372]] King [[H4428]] Solomon, [[H8010]] and he has taken hold [[H270]] of the horns [[H7161]] of the altar, [[H4196]] saying, [[H559]] ‘Let King [[H4428]] Solomon [[H8010]] first [[H3117]] swear [[H7650]] to me  not [[H518]] to put [[H4191]] his servant [[H5650]] to the sword. [[H2719]]

###### 52
And Solomon [[H8010]] replied, [[H559]] “If [[H518]] he is [[H1961]] a man [[H1121]] of character, [[H2428]] not [[H3808]] a single hair of his [[H8185]] will fall [[H5307]] to the ground. [[H776]] But if [[H518]] evil [[H7451]] is found [[H4672]] in him,  he will die.” [[H4191]]

###### 53
So King [[H4428]] Solomon [[H8010]] summoned [Adonijah] [[H7971]] down [[H3381]] from [[H5921]] the altar, [[H4196]] and he came [[H935]] and bowed down [[H7812]] before King [[H4428]] Solomon, [[H8010]] [who] [[H8010]] said [[H559]] to him,  “Go [[H1980]] to your home.” [[H1004]]
