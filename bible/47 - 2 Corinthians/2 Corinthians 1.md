### 1
Paul, [[G3972]] an apostle [[G652]] of Christ [[G5547]] Jesus [[G2424]] by [[G1223]] [the] will [[G2307]] of God, [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] Timothy [[G5095]] [our] [[G3588]] brother, [[G80]] To the [[G3588]] church [[G1577]] of God [[G2316]] in [[G1722]] Corinth, [[G2882]] together with [[G4862]] all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] saints [[G40]] throughout [[G1510]] Achaia: [[G882]]

### 2
Grace [[G5485]] and [[G2532]] peace [[G1515]] to you [[G4771]] from [[G575]] God [[G2316]] our [[G1473]] Father [[G3962]] and [[G2532]] [the] Lord [[G2962]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ. [[G5547]]

### 3
Blessed [be] [[G2128]] the [[G3588]] God [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] Father [[G3962]] of our [[G1473]] Lord [[G2962]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ, [[G5547]] the [[G3588]] Father [[G3962]] of compassion [[G3628]] and [[G2532]] [the] God [[G2316]] of all [[G3956]] comfort, [[G3874]]

### 4
who [[G3588]] comforts [[G3870]] us [[G1473]] in [[G1909]] all [[G3956]] our [[G1473]] troubles, [[G2347]] so that [[G1519]] we [[G1473]] can [[G1410]] comfort [[G3870]] those [[G3588]] in [[G1722]] any [[G3956]] trouble [[G2347]] with [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] comfort [[G3874]] we ourselves [[G846]] [have received] [[G3870]] from [[G5259]] God. [[G2316]]

### 5
For [[G3754]] just as [[G2531]] the [[G3588]] sufferings [[G3804]] of Christ [[G5547]] overflow [[G4052]] to [[G1519]] us, [[G1473]] so [[G3779]] also [[G2532]] through [[G1223]] Christ [[G5547]] our [[G1473]] comfort [[G3874]] overflows. [[G4052]]

### 6
If [[G1535]] we are afflicted, [[G2346]] [it is] for [[G5228]] your [[G4771]] comfort [[G3874]] and [[G2532]] salvation; [[G4991]] if [[G1535]] we are comforted, [[G3870]] [it is] for [[G5228]] your [[G4771]] comfort, [[G3874]] which [[G3588]] accomplishes [[G1754]] in you [[G1722]] patient endurance [[G5281]] of the [[G3588]] same [[G846]] sufferings [[G3804]] we [[G1473]] experience. [[G3958]]

### 7
And [[G2532]] our [[G1473]] hope [[G1680]] for [[G5228]] you [[G4771]] [is] sure, [[G949]] [because] we know [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] just as [[G5613]] you share [[G2844]] in [our] [[G3588]] sufferings, [[G3804]] so [[G3779]] also [you will share] [[G2532]] in [our] [[G3588]] comfort. [[G3874]]

### 8
We do not want [[G2309]] you [[G4771]] to be unaware, [[G50]] brothers, [[G80]] of [[G5228]] the [[G3588]] hardships [[G2347]] we [[G1473]] encountered [[G1096]] in [[G1722]] [the province of] Asia. [[G773]] We were under a burden [[G916]] far beyond [[G5236]] our ability to endure, [[G1411]] so that [[G5620]] we [[G1473]] despaired [[G1820]] even [[G2532]] of [[G3588]] life. [[G2198]]

### 9
Indeed, [[G235]] we [[G846]] felt [[G2192]] we were under [[G1438]] the [[G3588]] sentence [[G610]] of death, [[G2288]] in order that [[G2443]] we would not [[G1510]] trust [[G3982]] in [[G1909]] ourselves, [[G1438]] but [[G235]] in [[G1909]] God, [[G2316]] who [[G3588]] raises [[G1453]] the [[G3588]] dead. [[G3498]]

### 10
[He] [[G3739]] has delivered [[G4506]] us [[G1473]] from [[G1537]] such a deadly peril, [[G5082]] and [[G2532]] He will deliver [us]. [[G4506]] In [[G1519]] [Him] [[G3739]] we have placed our hope [[G1679]] that [[G3754]] He will yet again deliver [us], [[G4506]]

### 11
as you [[G4771]] help [[G4943]] us [[G1473]] by [[G3588]] [your] prayers. [[G1162]] Then [[G2443]] many [[G4183]] will give thanks [[G2168]] on [[G5228]] our behalf [[G1473]] for [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] favor shown [[G5486]] us [[G1473]] in answer to [[G1223]] [ their prayers ]. [[G4183]]

### 12
And [[G1063]] this [[G3778]] is [[G1510]] our [[G1473]] boast: [[G2746]] Our [[G1473]] conscience [[G4893]] testifies [[G3142]] that [[G3754]] we have conducted ourselves [[G390]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] world, [[G2889]] and [[G1161]] especially [[G4057]] in relation to [[G4314]] you, [[G4771]] in [[G1722]] [the] holiness [[G572]] and [[G2532]] sincerity [[G1505]] that [[G3588]] [are from] God [[G2316]] not [[G3756]] in [[G1722]] worldly [[G4559]] wisdom, [[G4678]] but [[G235]] in [[G1722]] [the] grace [[G5485]] of God. [[G2316]]

### 13
For [[G1063]] we do not write you anything [[G1125]] that is beyond [[G243]] your ability to read [[G314]] [and] [[G2228]] understand. [[G1921]] And [[G1161]] I hope [[G1679]] that [[G3754]] you will understand [[G1921]] completely, [[G2193]]

### 14
as [[G2531]] you have already understood [[G1921]] us [[G1473]] in [[G575]] part, [[G3313]] so that [[G3754]] you [[G4771]] may boast [[G2745]] of us [[G1510]] just as [[G2509]] we [[G1473]] [ will boast ] of you [[G4771]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] day [[G2250]] of our [[G1473]] Lord [[G2962]] Jesus. [[G2424]]

### 15
Confident [[G4006]] of this, [[G3778]] I planned [[G1014]] to visit [[G2064]] you [[G4771]] first, [[G4386]] so that [[G2443]] you might receive [[G2192]] a double [[G1208]] blessing. [[G5485]]

### 16
[I wanted] [[G2532]] to visit [[G1330]] you [[G4771]] on my way to [[G1519]] Macedonia, [[G3109]] and [[G2532]] to return [[G2064]] to [[G4314]] you [[G4771]] from [[G575]] Macedonia, [[G3109]] and then [[G2532]] [to have] [[G5259]] you [[G4771]] help me on my way [[G4311]] to [[G1519]] Judea. [[G2449]]

### 17
When I planned [[G1014]] this, [[G3778]] did I do it [[G5530]] carelessly? [[G1644]] Or [[G2228]] do I make my plans [[G1011]] by [[G2596]] human standards, [[G4561]] so as [to say] [[G2443]] “Yes, [[G3483]] yes” [[G3483]] when I [[G1473]] really mean [[G1510]] “No, [[G3756]] no”? [[G3756]]

### 18
But [as surely as] [[G1161]] God [is] [[G2316]] faithful, [[G4103]] our [[G1473]] message [[G3056]] to [[G4314]] you [[G4771]] is [[G1510]] not [[G3756]] “Yes” [[G3483]] and [[G2532]] “No.” [[G3756]]

### 19
For [[G1063]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of God, [[G2316]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ, [[G5547]] who [[G3588]] was proclaimed [[G2784]] among [[G1722]] you [[G4771]] by [[G1223]] me [[G1473]] and [[G2532]] Silvanus [[G4610]] and [[G2532]] Timothy, [[G5095]] was [[G1096]] not [[G3756]] “Yes” [[G3483]] and [[G2532]] “No,” [[G3756]] but [[G235]] in [[G1722]] Him [[G846]] it has always been [[G1096]] “Yes.” [[G3483]]

### 20
For [[G1063]] all [[G3745]] [the] promises [[G1860]] of God [[G2316]] [are] [[G3588]] “Yes” [[G3483]] in [[G1722]] [Christ]. [[G846]] And [[G2532]] so [[G1352]] through [[G1223]] Him, [[G846]] [our] [[G3588]] “Amen” [[G281]] is spoken [[G1473]] to [[G4314]] [the] glory [[G1391]] of God. [[G2316]]

### 21
Now [[G1161]] [it is] God [[G2316]] who [[G3588]] establishes [[G950]] [both] us [[G1473]] and [[G4862]] you [[G4771]] in [[G1519]] Christ. [[G5547]] He anointed [[G5548]] us, [[G1473]]

### 22
placed His seal [[G4972]] on us, [[G1473]] and [[G2532]] put [[G1325]] [His] [[G3588]] Spirit [[G4151]] in [[G1722]] our [[G1473]] hearts [[G2588]] as a pledge of what is to come. [[G728]]

### 23
I [[G1473]] call [[G1941]] God [[G2316]] as [[G1909]] my [[G1699]] witness [[G3144]] that [it was in order] [[G3754]] to spare [[G5339]] you [[G4771]] [that] I did not return [[G2064]] to [[G1519]] Corinth. [[G2882]]

### 24
Not [[G3756]] that [[G3754]] we lord it over [[G2961]] your [[G4771]] faith, [[G4102]] but [[G235]] we are [[G1510]] fellow workers [[G4904]] with you [[G4771]] for [[G3588]] [your] joy, [[G5479]] because [it is] [[G1063]] by [[G3588]] faith [that] [[G4102]] you stand firm. [[G2476]]
