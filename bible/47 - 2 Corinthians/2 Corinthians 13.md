# 2 Corinthians 13

[[2 Corinthians 12|←]] • [[Galatians 1|→]]

---

###### 1
This [is] [[G3778]] [the] third [time] [[G5154]] I am coming [[G2064]] to [[G4314]] you. [[G4771]] “Every [[G3956]] matter [[G4487]] must be established [[G2476]] by [[G1909]] [the] testimony [[G4750]] of two [[G1417]] or [[G2532]] three [[G5140]] witnesses.” [[G3144]]

###### 2
I already warned [you] [[G4302]] the [[G3588]] second time [[G1208]] I was [with you]. [[G3918]] [So] [[G2532]] now [[G3568]] in my absence, [[G548]] I warn [[G4302]] those who [[G3588]] sinned earlier [[G4258]] and [[G2532]] everyone [[G3956]] else: [[G3062]] If [[G1437]] I return, [[G2064]] I will not spare [anyone], [[G5339]]

###### 3
since [[G1893]] you are demanding [[G2212]] proof [[G1382]] that [[G3588]] Christ [[G5547]] is speaking [[G2980]] through [[G1722]] me. [[G1473]] [He] [[G3739]] is not weak [[G770]] in dealing with [[G1519]] you, [[G4771]] but [[G235]] is powerful [[G1414]] among [[G1722]] you. [[G4771]]

###### 4
For [[G1063]] He was indeed crucified [[G4717]] in [[G1537]] weakness, [[G769]] yet [[G235]] He lives [[G2198]] by [[G1537]] God’s [[G2316]] power. [[G1411]] And though [[G2532]] we [[G1473]] are weak [[G770]] in [[G1722]] Him, [[G846]] yet [[G235]] by [[G1537]] God’s [[G2316]] power [[G1411]] we will live [[G2198]] with [[G4862]] Him [[G846]] to serve [[G1519]] you. [[G4771]]

###### 5
Examine [[G3985]] yourselves [to see] [[G1438]] whether [[G1487]] you are [[G1510]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] faith; [[G4102]] test [[G1381]] yourselves. [[G1438]] Can’t you see [[G1921]] for yourselves [[G1438]] that [[G3754]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ [is] [[G5547]] in [[G1722]] you— [[G4771]] unless [[G1487]] you [[G1510]] actually [[G3385]] fail the test? [[G96]]

###### 6
And [[G1161]] I hope [[G1679]] you will realize [[G1097]] that [[G3754]] we [[G1473]] have [[G1510]] not [[G3756]] failed the test. [[G96]]

###### 7
Now [[G1161]] we pray [[G2172]] to [[G4314]] God [[G2316]] [that] you [[G4771]] will not do [[G4160]] [anything] [[G3367]] wrong— [[G2556]] not [[G3756]] that [[G2443]] we [[G1473]] will appear [[G5316]] to have stood the test, [[G1384]] but [[G235]] that [[G2443]] you [[G4771]] will do [[G4160]] what [is] [[G3588]] right, [[G2570]] even if [[G1161]] we [[G1473]] appear [[G1510]] to [[G5613]] have failed. [[G96]]

###### 8
For [[G1063]] we cannot do [[G1410]] anything [[G5100]] against [[G2596]] the [[G3588]] truth, [[G225]] but only [[G235]] for [[G5228]] the [[G3588]] truth. [[G225]]

###### 9
In fact, [[G1063]] we rejoice [[G5463]] when [[G3752]] we [[G1473]] are weak [[G770]] but [[G1161]] you [[G4771]] are [[G1510]] strong, [[G1415]] and [[G2532]] our prayer is for [[G2172]] your [[G4771]] perfection. [[G2676]]

###### 10
This is why [[G3778]] I write [[G1125]] these things [[G3778]] while absent, [[G548]] so that [[G2443]] when I am present [[G3918]] I will not need to be [[G5530]] severe [[G664]] in my use of [[G2596]] the [[G3588]] authority [[G1849]] that [[G3739]] the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] gave [[G1325]] me [[G1473]] for [[G1519]] building [you] up, [[G3619]] not [[G3756]] for [[G1519]] tearing [you] down. [[G2506]]

###### 11
Finally, [[G3063]] brothers, [[G80]] rejoice! [[G5463]] Aim for perfect harmony, [[G2675]] encourage one another, [[G3870]] [be of] [[G3588]] one [[G846]] mind, [[G5426]] live in peace. [[G1514]] And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] God [[G2316]] of love [[G26]] and [[G2532]] peace [[G1515]] will be [[G1510]] with [[G3326]] you. [[G4771]]

###### 12
Greet [[G782]] one another [[G240]] with [[G1722]] a holy [[G40]] kiss. [[G5370]]

###### 13
All [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] saints [[G40]] send you greetings. [[G782]]

###### 14
[May] the [[G3588]] grace [[G5485]] of the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ, [[G5547]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] love [[G26]] of [[G3588]] God, [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] fellowship [[G2842]] of the [[G3588]] Holy [[G40]] Spirit [[G4151]] [be] with [[G3326]] all [[G3956]] of you. [[G4771]]
