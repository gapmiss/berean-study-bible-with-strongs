### 1
Are we beginning [[G756]] to commend [[G4921]] ourselves [[G1438]] again? [[G3825]] Or [[G2228]] do we need, [[G5535]] like [[G5613]] some [people], [[G5100]] letters [[G1992]] of recommendation [[G4956]] to [[G4314]] you [[G4771]] or [[G2228]] from [[G1537]] you? [[G4771]]

### 2
You yourselves [[G4771]] are [[G1510]] our [[G1473]] letter, [[G1992]] inscribed [[G1449]] on [[G1722]] our [[G1473]] hearts, [[G2588]] known [[G1097]] and [[G2532]] read [[G314]] by [[G5259]] everyone. [[G3956]]

### 3
It is clear [[G5319]] that [[G3754]] you are [[G1510]] a letter [[G1992]] from Christ, [[G5547]] the result of our ministry, [[G1247]] written [[G1449]] not [[G3756]] with ink [[G3188]] but [[G235]] with [the] Spirit [[G4151]] of [the] living [[G2198]] God, [[G2316]] not [[G3756]] on [[G1722]] tablets [[G4109]] of stone [[G3035]] but [[G235]] on [[G1722]] tablets [[G4109]] of human [[G4560]] hearts. [[G2588]]

### 4
Such [[G5108]] confidence [[G4006]] before [[G4314]] God [[G2316]] is ours [[G2192]] through [[G1223]] Christ. [[G5547]]

### 5
Not [[G3756]] that [[G3754]] we are [[G1510]] competent [[G2425]] in [[G575]] ourselves [[G1438]] to claim that [[G3049]] anything [[G5100]] [comes] [[G5613]] from [[G1537]] us, [[G1438]] but [[G235]] our [[G1473]] competence [[G2426]] [comes] from [[G1537]] God. [[G2316]]

### 6
And [[G2532]] He [[G3739]] has qualified [[G2427]] us [[G1473]] [as] ministers [[G1249]] of a new [[G2537]] covenant, [[G1242]] not [[G3756]] of [the] letter [[G1121]] but [[G235]] of [the] Spirit; [[G4151]] for [[G1063]] the [[G3588]] letter [[G1121]] kills, [[G615]] but [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] Spirit [[G4151]] gives life. [[G2227]]

### 7
Now [[G1161]] if [[G1487]] the [[G3588]] ministry [[G1248]] of death, [[G2288]] which was engraved [[G1795]] in [[G1722]] letters [[G1121]] on stone, [[G3037]] came [[G1096]] with [[G1722]] {such} glory [[G1391]] that [[G5620]] the [[G3588]] Israelites [[G2474]] could [[G1410]] not [[G3361]] gaze [[G816]] at [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] face [[G4383]] of Moses [[G3475]] because of [[G1223]] [its] [[G4383]] fleeting [[G2673]] glory, [[G1391]]

### 8
will [[G1510]] not [[G3780]] the [[G3588]] ministry [[G1248]] of the [[G3588]] Spirit [[G4151]] {be} even more [[G3123]] glorious? [[G1391]]

### 9
For [[G1063]] if [[G1487]] the [[G3588]] ministry [[G1248]] of condemnation [[G2633]] was glorious, [[G1391]] how much [[G4183]] more [[G3123]] glorious [[G1391]] {is} the [[G3588]] ministry [[G1248]] of righteousness! [[G1343]]

### 10
Indeed, [[G2532]] what [[G3588]] was once glorious [[G1392]] has no glory now [[G1392]] in [[G1722]] comparison to [[G3313]] the [[G3588]] glory [that] [[G1391]] surpasses [it]. [[G5235]]

### 11
For [[G1063]] if [[G1487]] what [[G3588]] was fading away [[G2673]] [came] with [[G1223]] glory, [[G1391]] how much greater [[G4183]] [is the] [[G1722]] glory [[G1391]] of that which [[G3588]] endures! [[G3306]]

### 12
Therefore, [[G3767]] since we have [[G2192]] such [[G5108]] a hope, [[G1680]] we are [[G5530]] very [[G4183]] bold. [[G3954]]

### 13
[We are] [[G2532]] not [[G3756]] like [[G2509]] Moses, [[G3475]] [who] would put [[G5087]] a veil [[G2571]] over [[G1909]] his [[G846]] face [[G4383]] to keep [[G4314]] the [[G3588]] Israelites [[G2474]] [from] [[G3361]] gazing [[G816]] at [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] end [[G5056]] of what [[G3588]] was fading away. [[G2673]]

### 14
But [[G235]] their [[G846]] minds [[G3540]] were closed. [[G4456]] For [[G1063]] to [[G891]] [this] [[G4594]] day [[G2250]] the [[G3588]] same [[G846]] veil [[G2571]] remains [[G3306]] at [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] reading [[G320]] of the [[G3588]] old [[G3820]] covenant. [[G1242]] It has not been lifted, [[G343]] [because] only [[G3754]] in [[G1722]] Christ [[G5547]] can it be removed. [[G2673]]

### 15
And even [[G235]] to [[G2193]] this day [[G4594]] when [[G2259]] Moses [[G3475]] is read, [[G314]] a veil [[G2571]] covers [[G2749]] their [[G846]] hearts. [[G2588]]

### 16
But [[G1161]] whenever [[G2259]] [anyone] turns [[G1994]] to [[G4314]] [the] Lord, [[G2962]] the [[G3588]] veil [[G2571]] is taken away. [[G4014]]

### 17
Now [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] is [[G1510]] the [[G3588]] Spirit, [[G4151]] and [[G1161]] where [[G3757]] the [[G3588]] Spirit [[G4151]] of [the] Lord [is], [[G2962]] [there is] freedom. [[G1657]]

### 18
And [[G1161]] we, [who] [[G1473]] with unveiled [[G343]] faces [[G4383]] all [[G3956]] reflect [[G2734]] the [[G3588]] glory [[G1391]] of [the] Lord, [[G2962]] are being transformed into [[G3339]] [His] [[G846]] image [[G1504]] with intensifying glory, [[G1391]] which comes [[G2509]] from [[G575]] [the] Lord, [[G2962]] [who is the] Spirit.
