###### 1
Now, [[G1161]] brothers, [[G80]] we want you to know about [[G1107]] the [[G3588]] grace [[G5485]] God [[G2316]] has given [[G1325]] the [[G3588]] churches [[G1577]] of Macedonia. [[G3109]]

###### 2
In [[G1722]] [the] terrible [[G4183]] ordeal [[G1382]] they suffered, [[G2347]] their [[G846]] abundant [[G4050]] joy [[G5479]] and [[G2532]] deep [[G899]] poverty [[G4432]] overflowed [[G4052]] into [[G1519]] rich [[G4149]] generosity. [[G572]]

###### 3
For [[G3754]] I testify [that] [[G3140]] [they gave] according to [[G2596]] [their] ability [[G1411]] and even [[G2532]] beyond [[G3844]] [it]. [[G1411]] Of their own accord, [[G830]]

###### 4
they pleaded [[G1189]] earnestly [[G3874]] for the [[G3588]] privilege [[G5485]] of sharing [[G2842]] in [this] [[G3588]] service [[G1248]] to [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] saints. [[G40]]

###### 5
And [[G2532]] not [only] [[G3756]] [did they do] as [[G2531]] we expected, [[G1679]] but [[G235]] they gave [[G1325]] themselves [[G1438]] first [[G4412]] to the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] and then [[G2532]] to us, [[G1473]] because it was [[G1223]] [the] will [[G2307]] of God. [[G2316]]

###### 6
So [[G1519]] we [[G1473]] urged [[G3870]] Titus [[G5103]] to help complete [[G2005]] your [[G4771]] [act of] [[G3588]] grace, [[G5485]] just as [[G2531]] he had started [it]. [[G4278]]

###### 7
But [[G235]] just as [[G5618]] you excel [[G4052]] in [[G1722]] everything— [[G3956]] in faith, [[G4102]] in speech, [[G3056]] in knowledge, [[G1108]] in [[G2532]] complete [[G3956]] earnestness, [[G4710]] and [[G2532]] in the [[G3588]] love [[G26]] we [[G1473]] [inspired] [[G1537]] in [[G1722]] you— [[G4771]] [see] that [[G2443]] you also excel [[G4052]] in [[G1722]] this [[G3778]] grace of giving. [[G5485]]

###### 8
I am not making [[G3004]] a demand, [[G2003]] but [[G235]] I am testing [[G1381]] the [[G3588]] sincerity [[G1103]] of your [[G5212]] love [[G26]] in comparison to [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] earnestness [[G4710]] of others. [[G2087]]

###### 9
For [[G1063]] you know [[G1097]] the [[G3588]] grace [[G5485]] of our [[G1473]] Lord [[G2962]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ, [[G5547]] that [[G3754]] [though] He was [[G1510]] rich, [[G4145]] yet for your sakes [[G1223]] He became poor, [[G4433]] so that [[G2443]] you [[G4771]] through [His] [[G1565]] poverty [[G4432]] might become rich. [[G4147]]

###### 10
And [[G2532]] this [[G3778]] is my opinion [[G1325]] about [[G1063]] what is helpful [[G4851]] for you [[G4771]] in [[G1722]] this [matter]: [[G3778]] Last year [[G4070]] [you were] [[G3748]] the first [[G4278]] not [[G3756]] only [[G3440]] to [give], [[G4160]] but [[G235]] even [[G2532]] to have such a desire. [[G2309]]

###### 11
Now [[G3570]] finish [[G2005]] the work, [[G4160]] so that [[G3704]] you may complete it [[G2005]] just as [[G2509]] eagerly [[G4288]] as you began, [[G2309]] according to [[G1537]] [your] [[G3588]] means. [[G2192]]

###### 12
For [[G1063]] if [[G1487]] the [[G3588]] eagerness [[G4288]] is there, [[G4295]] [the gift] is acceptable [[G2144]] according to [[G2526]] what [[G1437]] one has, [[G2192]] not [[G3756]] according to [[G2526]] [what] he does not have. [[G2192]]

###### 13
[It is not our intention] [[G1063]] that [[G2443]] others [[G243]] may be relieved [[G425]] while you [[G4771]] are burdened, [[G2347]] but [[G235]] [that there may be] [[G1537]] equality. [[G2471]]

###### 14
At [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] present [[G3568]] time, [[G2540]] your [[G4771]] surplus [[G4051]] will meet [[G1519]] their [[G1565]] need, [[G5303]] so that [[G2443]] in turn [[G2532]] their [[G1565]] surplus [[G4051]] will [[G1096]] meet [[G1519]] your [[G4771]] need. [[G5303]] Then [[G3704]] there will be [[G1096]] equality. [[G2471]]

###### 15
As [[G2531]] it is written: [[G1125]] “He who [gathered] [[G3588]] much [[G4183]] had no excess, [[G4121]] and [[G2532]] he who [gathered] [[G3588]] little [[G3641]] had no shortfall.” [[G1641]]

###### 16
But [[G1161]] thanks [be] [[G5485]] to God, [[G2316]] who [[G3588]] put [[G1325]] into [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] heart [[G2588]] of Titus [[G5103]] the [[G3588]] same [[G846]] devotion [[G4710]] [I have] for [[G5228]] you. [[G4771]]

###### 17
For [[G3754]] not only [[G3303]] did he welcome [[G1209]] [our] [[G3588]] appeal, [[G3874]] but [[G1161]] he [[G5225]] {is} eagerly [[G4705]] coming [[G1831]] to [[G4314]] you [[G4771]] of his own volition. [[G830]]

###### 18
Along with [[G3326]] [Titus], [[G846]] we are sending [[G4842]] the [[G3588]] brother [[G80]] who [[G3739]] is praised [[G1868]] by [[G1223]] all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] churches [[G1577]] [for his work] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] gospel. [[G2098]]

###### 19
More than that, [[G2532]] [this brother] was chosen [[G5500]] by [[G5259]] the [[G3588]] churches [[G1577]] to accompany [[G4898]] us [[G1473]] with [[G4862]] [the offering]— [[G3778]] the [[G3588]] gracious gift [[G5485]] we [[G1473]] administer [[G1247]] to [[G4314]] honor [[G1391]] the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] Himself [[G846]] and [to show] [[G2532]] our [[G1473]] eagerness [to help]. [[G4288]]

###### 20
We [hope to] avoid [[G4724]] any [[G5100]] criticism [[G3469]] of [[G1722]] [the way] [[G5259]] we [[G1473]] administer [[G1247]] this [[G3778]] generous [ gift ]. [[G100]]

###### 21
For [[G1063]] we are taking great care to do [[G4306]] what is right, [[G2570]] not [[G3756]] only [[G3440]] in the eyes [[G1799]] of [the] Lord, [[G2962]] but [[G235]] also [[G2532]] in the eyes [[G1799]] of men. [[G444]]

###### 22
And [[G1161]] we are sending along with them [[G4842]] our [[G1473]] brother, [[G80]] whose [[G3739]] earnestness [[G4705]] has been proven [[G1381]] many times [[G4178]] [and] in [[G1722]] many ways, [[G4183]] and [[G1161]] now [[G3570]] even [[G4183]] more [[G4183]] [so] [[G4705]] by [his] great confidence [[G4006]] in [[G1519]] you. [[G4771]]

###### 23
As for [[G1535]] Titus, [[G5103]] [he is] my [[G1699]] partner [[G2844]] and [[G2532]] fellow worker [[G4904]] among [[G1519]] you. [[G4771]] [As for] [[G1535]] our [[G1473]] brothers, [[G80]] [they are] messengers [[G652]] of [the] churches [[G1577]] [to the] glory [[G1391]] of Christ. [[G5547]]

###### 24
In [[G1519]] full view [[G4383]] of the [[G3588]] churches, [[G1577]] then, [[G3767]] show [[G1731]] [these men] [[G846]] the [[G3588]] proof [[G1732]] of [[G3588]] your [[G4771]] love [[G26]] and [[G2532]] the reason for our boasting [[G2746]] about [[G5228]] you. [[G4771]]
