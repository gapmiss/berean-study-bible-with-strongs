### 1
Therefore, [[G3767]] beloved, [[G27]] since we have [[G2192]] these [[G3778]] promises, [[G1860]] let us cleanse [[G2511]] ourselves [[G1438]] from [[G575]] everything that [[G3956]] defiles [[G3436]] body [[G4561]] and [[G2532]] spirit, [[G4151]] perfecting [[G2005]] holiness [[G42]] in [[G1722]] [the] fear [[G5401]] of God. [[G2316]]

### 2
Make room for us in your hearts. [[G5562]] We have wronged [[G91]] no one, [[G3762]] we have corrupted [[G5351]] no one, [[G3762]] we have exploited [[G4122]] no one. [[G3762]]

### 3
I do not say this [[G3004]] to [[G4314]] condemn [you]. [[G2633]] I have said before [[G4302]] that [[G3754]] you {so} occupy [[G1510]] our [[G1473]] hearts [[G2588]] that [[G1519]] we live [[G4800]] and [[G2532]] die together [with you]. [[G4880]]

### 4
Great [is] [[G4183]] my [[G1473]] confidence [[G3954]] in [[G4314]] you; [[G4771]] great [is] [[G4183]] my [[G1473]] pride [[G2746]] in [[G5228]] you; [[G4771]] I am filled [[G4137]] with encouragement; [[G3874]] in [[G1909]] all [[G3956]] our [[G1473]] troubles [[G2347]] my joy overflows. [[G5248]]

### 5
For [[G1063]] [when] [[G2532]] we [[G1473]] arrived [[G2064]] in [[G1519]] Macedonia, [[G3109]] our [[G1473]] bodies [[G4561]] had [[G2192]] no [[G3762]] rest, [[G425]] but [[G235]] we were pressed [[G2346]] from [[G1722]] every [direction]— [[G3956]] conflicts [[G3163]] on the outside, [[G1855]] fears [[G5401]] within. [[G2081]]

### 6
But [[G235]] God, [[G2316]] who [[G3588]] comforts [[G3870]] the [[G3588]] downcast, [[G5011]] comforted [[G3870]] us [[G1473]] by [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] arrival [[G3952]] of Titus, [[G5103]]

### 7
and [[G1161]] not [[G3756]] only [[G3440]] by [[G1722]] his [[G846]] arrival, [[G3952]] but [[G235]] also [[G2532]] by [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] comfort [[G3874]] [he had received] [[G3870]] from [[G1909]] you. [[G4771]] He told us about [[G312]] your [[G4771]] longing, [[G1972]] your [[G4771]] mourning, [[G3602]] [and] your [[G4771]] zeal [[G2205]] for [[G5228]] me, [[G1473]] so that [[G5620]] I [[G1473]] rejoiced [[G5463]] all the more. [[G3123]]

### 8
Even [[G2532]] if [[G1487]] I caused you sorrow [[G3076]] by [[G1722]] [my] [[G3588]] letter, [[G1992]] I do not regret [it]. [[G3338]] Although [[G2532]] I did regret [it], [[G3338]] I now see [[G991]] that [[G3754]] [my] [[G3588]] letter [[G1992]] [caused] [[G1565]] you [[G4771]] sorrow, [[G3076]] but only [[G2532]] for [[G4314]] a short time. [[G5610]]

### 9
[And] now [[G3568]] I rejoice, [[G5463]] not [[G3756]] because [[G3754]] you were made sorrowful, [[G3076]] but [[G235]] because [[G3754]] your sorrow [[G3076]] led you to [[G1519]] repentance. [[G3341]] For [[G1063]] you felt the sorrow [[G3076]] that God had intended, [[G2596]] and so [[G2443]] were not harmed [[G2210]] in [[G1722]] [any way] [[G3367]] by [[G1537]] us. [[G1473]]

### 10
Godly [[G2316]] sorrow [[G3077]] brings [[G2038]] repentance [[G3341]] that leads to [[G1519]] salvation [[G4991]] without regret, [[G278]] but [[G1161]] worldly [[G2889]] sorrow [[G3077]] brings [[G2716]] death. [[G2288]]

### 11
Consider [what] [[G2400]] this [[G846]] godly [[G2316]] sorrow [[G3076]] has produced [[G2716]] in you: [[G4771]] what [[G4214]] earnestness, [[G4710]] [what] [[G235]] eagerness to clear yourselves, [[G627]] [what] [[G235]] indignation, [[G24]] [what] [[G235]] alarm, [[G5401]] [what] [[G235]] longing, [[G1972]] [what] [[G235]] zeal, [[G2205]] [what] [[G235]] vindication! [[G1557]] In [[G1722]] every way [[G3956]] you have proved [[G4921]] yourselves [[G1438]] to be [[G1510]] innocent [[G53]] in this [[G3588]] matter. [[G4229]]

### 12
So [[G686]] even [[G2532]] though [[G1487]] I wrote [[G1125]] to you, [[G4771]] [it was] not [[G3756]] on account of [[G1752]] the [one who] [[G3588]] did wrong [[G91]] [or] [[G3761]] the [one who] [[G3588]] was harmed, [[G91]] but rather [[G235]] that [[G1752]] your [[G4771]] earnestness [[G4710]] on our behalf [[G5228]] would be made clear [[G5319]] to [[G4314]] you [[G4771]] in the sight [[G1799]] of God. [[G2316]]

### 13
On account of [[G1223]] this, [[G3778]] we are encouraged. [[G3870]] In addition to [[G1909]] our [[G1473]] own [[G3588]] encouragement, [[G3874]] we were even more delighted [[G5463]] by [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] joy [[G5479]] of Titus. [[G5103]] For [[G3754]] his [[G846]] spirit [[G4151]] has been refreshed [[G373]] by [[G575]] all [[G3956]] of you. [[G4771]]

### 14
Indeed, [[G3754]] I was not embarrassed [[G2617]] by anything [[G5100]] I had boasted [[G2744]] to him [[G846]] about [[G5228]] you. [[G4771]] But [[G235]] just as [[G5613]] everything [[G3956]] we said [[G2980]] to you [[G4771]] [was] true, [[G225]] so [[G3779]] our [[G1473]] boasting [[G2746]] to [[G1909]] Titus [[G5103]] has proved to be [[G1096]] TRUE [[G225]] as well. [[G2532]]

### 15
And [[G2532]] his [[G846]] affection [[G4698]] for [[G1519]] you [[G4771]] is [[G1510]] even greater [[G4057]] when he remembers [[G363]] that [[G5613]] you {were} [[G4771]] all [[G3956]] obedient [[G5218]] [as] you welcomed [[G1209]] him [[G846]] with [[G3326]] fear [[G5401]] and [[G2532]] trembling. [[G5156]]

### 16
I rejoice [[G5463]] that [[G3754]] I can have complete confidence [[G2292]] in [[G1722]] you. [[G4771]]
