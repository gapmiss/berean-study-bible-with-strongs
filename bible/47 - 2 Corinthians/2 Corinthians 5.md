###### 1
Now [[G1063]] we know [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] if [[G1437]] the [[G3588]] earthly [[G1919]] tent [[G4636]] we [[G1473]] [live in] [[G3614]] is dismantled, [[G2647]] we have [[G2192]] a building [[G3619]] from [[G1537]] God, [[G2316]] an eternal [[G166]] house [[G3614]] in [[G1722]] heaven, [[G3772]] not built by human hands. [[G886]]

###### 2
For [[G1063]] in [[G1722]] this [tent] [[G3778]] we groan, [[G4727]] longing [[G1971]] to be clothed with [[G1902]] our [[G1473]] heavenly [[G3772]] dwelling, [[G3613]]

###### 3
because [[G1487]] when we are clothed, [[G1746]] we will not be found [[G2147]] naked. [[G1131]]

###### 4
So [[G2532]] [while] we are [[G1510]] in [[G1722]] [this] [[G3588]] tent, [[G4636]] we groan [[G4727]] under our burdens, [[G916]] because [[G1909]] we do not wish [[G2309]] to be unclothed [[G1562]] but [[G235]] clothed, [[G1902]] so that [[G2443]] [our] [[G3588]] mortality [[G2349]] may be swallowed up [[G2666]] by [[G5259]] life. [[G2222]]

###### 5
And [[G1161]] God [[G2316]] has prepared [[G2716]] us [[G1473]] for [[G1519]] this [[G3778]] very [purpose] [[G846]] [and] has given [[G1325]] us [[G1473]] the [[G3588]] Spirit [[G4151]] as a pledge of what is to come. [[G728]]

###### 6
Therefore [[G3767]] we are always confident, [[G2292]] although [[G2532]] we know [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] while we are at home [[G1736]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] body, [[G4983]] we are away [[G1553]] from [[G575]] the [[G3588]] Lord. [[G2962]]

###### 7
For [[G1063]] we walk [[G4043]] by [[G1223]] faith, [[G4102]] not [[G3756]] by [[G1223]] sight. [[G1491]]

###### 8
We are confident, [[G2292]] then, [[G1161]] and [[G2532]] would prefer [[G2106]] to be away [[G1553]] from [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] body [[G4983]] and [[G2532]] at home [[G1736]] with [[G4314]] the [[G3588]] Lord. [[G2962]]

###### 9
So [[G1352]] we aspire [[G5389]] to [[G1510]] please [[G2101]] Him, [[G846]] whether [[G1535]] we are here in this body [[G1736]] or [[G1535]] away from it. [[G1553]]

###### 10
For [[G1063]] we [[G1473]] must [[G1163]] all [[G3956]] appear [[G5319]] before [[G1715]] the [[G3588]] judgment seat [[G968]] of Christ, [[G5547]] that [[G2443]] each one [[G1538]] may receive his due [[G2865]] for [[G4314]] the things [[G3739]] done [[G4238]] in [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] body, [[G4983]] whether [[G1535]] good [[G18]] or [[G1535]] bad. [[G5337]]

###### 11
Therefore, [[G3767]] since we know [[G1492]] [what it means] [[G3588]] to fear [[G5401]] the [[G3588]] Lord, [[G2962]] we try to persuade [[G3982]] men. [[G444]] What we are is clear [[G5319]] to God, [[G2316]] and [[G1161]] I hope [[G1679]] it is clear [[G5319]] to [[G1722]] your [[G4771]] conscience [[G4893]] as well. [[G2532]]

###### 12
We are not commending [[G4921]] ourselves [[G1438]] to you [[G4771]] again. [[G3825]] Instead, [[G235]] we are giving [[G1325]] you [[G4771]] an occasion [[G874]] to be proud [[G2745]] of [[G5228]] us, [[G1473]] so that [[G2443]] you can answer [[G2192]] those who [[G3588]] take pride [[G2744]] in [[G1722]] appearances [[G4383]] [rather than] [[G2532]] in [[G1722]] [the] heart. [[G2588]]

###### 13
If [[G1535]] we are out of our mind, [[G1839]] [it is] for God; [[G2316]] if [[G1535]] we are of sound mind, [[G4993]] [it is] for you. [[G4771]]

###### 14
For [[G1063]] Christ’s [[G5547]] love [[G26]] compels [[G4912]] us, [[G1473]] [because] we are convinced [[G2919]] that [[G3754]] One [[G1520]] died [[G599]] for [[G5228]] all, [[G3956]] therefore [[G686]] all [[G3956]] died. [[G599]]

###### 15
And [[G2532]] He died [[G599]] for [[G5228]] all, [[G3956]] that [[G2443]] those who [[G3588]] live [[G2198]] {should} no longer [[G3371]] live [[G2198]] for themselves, [[G1438]] but [[G235]] for Him [who] [[G3588]] died [[G599]] for [[G5228]] them [[G846]] and [[G2532]] was raised again. [[G1453]]

###### 16
So [[G5620]] from [[G575]] now on [[G3568]] we [[G1473]] regard [[G1492]] no one [[G3762]] according to [[G2596]] [the] flesh. [[G4561]] Although [[G1487]] we once regarded [[G1097]] Christ [[G5547]] [in this way], [[G2596]] [we do so] [[G1097]] no longer. [[G3765]]

###### 17
Therefore [[G5620]] if [[G1487]] anyone [[G5100]] [is] in [[G1722]] Christ, [[G5547]] [he is] a new [[G2537]] creation. [[G2937]] The [[G3588]] old [[G744]] has passed away. [[G3928]] Behold, [[G2400]] [the] new [[G2537]] has come! [[G1096]]

###### 18
All this [is] [[G3956]] from [[G1537]] God, [[G2316]] who [[G3588]] reconciled [[G2644]] us [[G1473]] to Himself [[G1438]] through [[G1223]] Christ [[G5547]] and [[G2532]] gave [[G1325]] us [[G1473]] the [[G3588]] ministry [[G1248]] of reconciliation: [[G2643]]

###### 19
that [[G5613]] God [[G2316]] was [[G1510]] reconciling [[G2644]] [the] world [[G2889]] to Himself [[G1438]] in [[G1722]] Christ, [[G5547]] not [[G3361]] counting [[G3049]] [men’s] [[G846]] trespasses [[G3900]] against them. [[G846]] And [[G2532]] He has committed [[G5087]] to [[G1722]] us [[G1473]] the [[G3588]] message [[G3056]] of reconciliation. [[G2643]]

###### 20
Therefore [[G3767]] we are ambassadors [[G4243]] for [[G5228]] Christ, [[G5547]] as though [[G5613]] God [[G2316]] were making His appeal [[G3870]] through [[G1223]] us. [[G1473]] We implore you [[G1189]] on behalf [[G5228]] of Christ: [[G5547]] Be reconciled [[G2644]] to God. [[G2316]]

###### 21
[God] made [[G4160]] Him who [[G3588]] knew [[G1097]] no [[G3361]] sin [[G266]] [to be] sin [[G266]] on our behalf, [[G1473]] so that [[G2443]] in [[G1722]] Him [[G846]] we [[G1473]] might become [[G1096]] [the] righteousness [[G1343]] of God. [[G2316]]
