###### 1
Now [[G1063]] about [[G4012]] the [[G3588]] service [[G1248]] to [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] saints, [[G40]] there is [[G1510]] no need [[G4053]] for me [[G1473]] to write [[G1125]] to you. [[G4771]]

###### 2
For [[G1063]] I know [[G1492]] your [[G4771]] eagerness [to help], [[G4288]] [and] [[G3739]] I have been boasting [[G2744]] to [the] Macedonians [[G3110]] that [[G3754]] since [[G575]] last year [[G4070]] you [[G4771]] in Achaia [[G882]] were prepared [ to give ]. [[G3903]] And [[G2532]] your [[G4771]] zeal [[G2205]] has stirred [[G2042]] most [ of them to do likewise ]. [[G4119]]

###### 3
But [[G1161]] I am sending [[G3992]] the [[G3588]] brothers [[G80]] in order that [[G2443]] our [[G1473]] boasting [[G2745]] about [[G5228]] you [[G4771]] in [[G1722]] this [[G3778]] matter [[G3313]] should not prove empty, [[G2758]] [but] that [[G2443]] you will be [[G1510]] prepared, [[G3903]] just as [[G2531]] I said. [[G2036]]

###### 4
Otherwise, [[G3361]] if [any] [[G1437]] Macedonians [[G3110]] come [[G2064]] with [[G4862]] me [[G1473]] and [[G2532]] find [[G2147]] you [[G4771]] unprepared, [[G532]] we— [[G1473]] to [[G2443]] say [[G3004]] nothing [[G3361]] of you— [[G4771]] would be ashamed of [[G2617]] [having been] [[G1722]] so [[G3778]] confident. [[G5287]]

###### 5
So [[G3767]] I thought [it] [[G2233]] necessary [[G316]] to urge [[G3870]] the [[G3588]] brothers [[G80]] to [[G2443]] visit you beforehand [[G4281]] and [[G2532]] make arrangements [[G4294]] for the [[G3588]] bountiful gift [[G2129]] you had promised. [[G4279]] This way, [[G3779]] your [[G4771]] [gift] [[G3778]] will be [[G1510]] prepared [[G2092]] generously [[G2129]] and [[G2532]] not [[G3361]] begrudgingly. [[G4124]]

###### 6
[Consider] [[G1161]] this: [[G3778]] Whoever [[G3588]] sows [[G4687]] sparingly [[G5340]] {will} also [[G2532]] reap [[G2325]] sparingly, [[G5340]] and [[G2532]] whoever [[G3588]] sows [[G4687]] generously [[G2129]] {will} also [[G2532]] reap [[G2325]] generously. [[G2129]]

###### 7
Each one [[G1538]] [ should give ] what [[G2531]] he has decided [[G4255]] in [his] [[G3588]] heart [to give ], [[G2588]] not [[G3361]] out of [[G1537]] regret [[G3077]] or [[G2228]] compulsion. [[G318]] For [[G1063]] God [[G2316]] loves [[G25]] a cheerful [[G2431]] giver. [[G1395]]

###### 8
And [[G1161]] God [[G2316]] [is] able [[G1414]] {to make} all [[G3956]] grace [[G5485]] abound [[G4052]] to [[G1519]] you, [[G4771]] so that [[G2443]] in [[G1722]] all things, [[G3956]] at all times, [[G3842]] having [[G2192]] all that [[G3956]] you need, [[G841]] you will abound [[G4052]] in [[G1519]] every [[G3956]] good [[G18]] work. [[G2041]]

###### 9
As [[G2531]] it is written: [[G1125]] “He has scattered abroad [[G4650]] His gifts [[G1325]] to the [[G3588]] poor; [[G3993]] His [[G846]] righteousness [[G1343]] endures [[G3306]] forever.” [[G1519]]

###### 10
Now [[G1161]] He who [[G3588]] supplies [[G2023]] seed [[G4703]] to the [[G3588]] sower [[G4687]] and [[G2532]] bread [[G740]] for [[G1519]] food [[G1035]] will supply [[G5524]] and [[G2532]] multiply [[G4129]] your [[G4771]] store of seed [[G4703]] and [[G2532]] will increase [[G837]] the [[G3588]] harvest [[G1081]] of [[G3588]] your [[G4771]] righteousness. [[G1343]]

###### 11
You will be enriched [[G4148]] in [[G1722]] every way [[G3956]] to [[G1519]] be generous [[G572]] on every [occasion], [[G3956]] [and your giving] [[G3748]] through [[G1223]] us [[G1473]] will produce [[G2716]] thanksgiving [[G2169]] to God. [[G2316]]

###### 12
For [[G3754]] this [[G3778]] ministry [[G1248]] of service [[G3009]] is [[G1510]] not [[G3756]] only [[G3440]] supplying [[G4322]] the [[G3588]] needs [[G5303]] of the [[G3588]] saints, [[G40]] but [[G235]] is also overflowing [[G4052]] in [[G1223]] many [[G4183]] expressions of thanksgiving [[G2169]] to God. [[G2316]]

###### 13
Because of [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] proof [[G1382]] this [[G3778]] ministry {provides}, [[G1248]] [the saints] will glorify [[G1392]] God [[G2316]] for [[G1909]] your [[G4771]] obedient [[G5292]] confession [[G3671]] of [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] gospel [[G2098]] of Christ, [[G5547]] and [[G2532]] [for the] generosity [[G572]] of [your] [[G3588]] contribution [[G2842]] to [[G1519]] them [[G846]] and [[G2532]] to [[G1519]] all [the others]. [[G3956]]

###### 14
And [[G2532]] their [[G846]] prayers [[G1162]] for [[G5228]] you [[G4771]] will express their affection [[G1971]] for you, [[G4771]] because of [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] surpassing [[G5235]] grace [[G5485]] God [[G2316]] [has given] [[G1909]] you. [[G4771]]

###### 15
Thanks [be] [[G5485]] to God [[G2316]] for [[G1909]] His [[G846]] indescribable [[G411]] gift! [[G1431]]
