### 1
I must [[G1163]] go on boasting. [[G2744]] Although there is nothing to gain, [[G4851]] I will go on [[G2064]] to [[G1519]] visions [[G3701]] and [[G2532]] revelations [[G602]] from [the] Lord. [[G2962]]

### 2
I know [[G1492]] a man [[G444]] in [[G1722]] Christ [[G5547]] [who] fourteen [[G1180]] years [[G2094]] ago [[G4253]] was caught up [[G726]] to [[G2193]] [the] third [[G5154]] heaven. [[G3772]] Whether [it was] [[G1535]] in [[G1722]] [the] body [[G4983]] or [[G1535]] out of [[G1622]] [it] [[G4983]] I do not know, [[G1492]] [but] God [[G2316]] knows. [[G1492]]

### 3
And [[G2532]] I know that [[G1492]] [this] [[G5108]] man— [[G444]] whether [[G1535]] in [[G1722]] [the] body [[G4983]] or [[G1535]] out of [[G5565]] [it] [[G4983]] I do not know, [[G1492]] [but] God [[G2316]] knows— [[G1492]]

### 4
was caught up [[G726]] into [[G1519]] Paradise. [[G3857]] [The things] he heard [[G191]] [were] too sacred [[G731]] for words, [[G4487]] things that [[G3739]] man [[G444]] is not permitted [[G1832]] to tell. [[G2980]]

### 5
I will boast [[G2744]] about [[G5228]] such a man, [[G5108]] but [[G1161]] I will not boast [[G2744]] about [[G5228]] myself, [[G1683]] except [[G1487]] in [[G1722]] [my] [[G3588]] weaknesses. [[G769]]

### 6
Even [[G1063]] if [[G1437]] I wanted [[G2309]] to boast, [[G2744]] I would not be [[G1510]] a fool, [[G878]] because [[G1063]] I would be speaking [[G2046]] [the] truth. [[G225]] But [[G1161]] I refrain, [[G5339]] [so] [[G3361]] [no one] [[G5100]] will credit [[G3049]] me [[G1473]] with more than [[G5228]] he sees [[G991]] in me [[G1473]] or [[G2228]] hears [[G191]] from [[G1537]] me, [[G1473]]

### 7
[or] [[G2532]] with these [[G3588]] surpassingly great [[G5236]] revelations. [[G602]] So [[G1352]] to [[G2443]] keep me from becoming conceited, [[G5229]] I [[G1473]] was given [[G1325]] a thorn [[G4647]] in [my] [[G3588]] flesh, [[G4561]] a messenger [[G32]] of Satan, [[G4567]] to [[G2443]] torment [[G2852]] me. [[G1473]]

### 8
Three times [[G5151]] I pleaded with [[G3870]] the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] to [[G2443]] take it away [[G868]] from [[G575]] me. [[G1473]]

### 9
But [[G2532]] He said [[G2046]] to me, [[G1473]] “My [[G1473]] grace [[G5485]] is sufficient [[G714]] for you, [[G4771]] for [[G1063]] [My] [[G3588]] power [[G1411]] is perfected [[G5055]] in [[G1722]] weakness.” [[G769]] Therefore [[G3767]] I will boast [[G2744]] all the more [[G3123]] gladly [[G2236]] in [[G1722]] my [[G1473]] weaknesses, [[G769]] so that [[G2443]] the [[G3588]] power [[G1411]] of Christ [[G5547]] may rest [[G1981]] on [[G1909]] me. [[G1473]]

### 10
That is why, [[G1352]] for the sake [[G5228]] of Christ, [[G5547]] I delight [[G2106]] in [[G1722]] weaknesses, [[G769]] in [[G1722]] insults, [[G5196]] in [[G1722]] hardships, [[G318]] in [[G1722]] persecutions, [[G1375]] [in] [[G2532]] difficulties. [[G4730]] For [[G1063]] when [[G3752]] I am weak, [[G770]] then [[G5119]] I am [[G1510]] strong. [[G1415]]

### 11
I have become [[G1096]] a fool, [[G878]] [but] you [[G4771]] drove [[G315]] me [to it]. [[G1473]] In fact, [[G1063]] you [[G4771]] should [[G3784]] have commended [[G4921]] me, [[G1473]] since [[G1063]] I am in no way inferior [[G5302]] to those [[G3588]] “super-apostles,” [[G5228]] even [[G2532]] though [[G1487]] I am [[G1510]] nothing. [[G3762]]

### 12
The [[G3588]] TRUE [[G3303]] marks [[G4592]] of an apostle— [[G652]] signs, [[G4592]] wonders, [[G5059]] and [[G2532]] miracles— [[G1411]] were performed [[G2716]] among [[G1722]] you [[G4771]] with [[G1722]] great [[G3956]] perseverance. [[G5281]]

### 13
In what way [[G5101]] were you inferior [[G2274]] to [[G5228]] the [[G3588]] other [[G3062]] churches, [[G1577]] except [[G1487]] that [[G3754]] I [[G1473]] was not a burden [[G2655]] to you? [[G4771]] Forgive [[G5483]] me [[G1473]] this [[G3778]] wrong! [[G93]]

### 14
See, [[G2400]] I am [[G2192]] ready [[G2093]] to come [[G2064]] to [[G4314]] you [[G4771]] a third time, [[G5154]] and [[G2532]] I will not be a burden, [[G2655]] because [[G1063]] I am not seeking [[G2212]] your [[G4771]] [possessions], [[G3588]] but [[G235]] you [yourselves]. [[G4771]] For [[G1063]] children [[G5043]] should not have [[G3784]] to save up [[G2343]] for [their] [[G3588]] parents, [[G1118]] but [[G235]] parents [[G1118]] for [their] [[G3588]] children. [[G5043]]

### 15
And [[G1161]] for the sake of [[G5228]] your [[G4771]] souls, [[G5590]] I [[G1473]] {will} most gladly [[G2236]] spend my money [[G1159]] and [[G2532]] [myself]. [[G1550]] If [[G1487]] I love [[G25]] you [[G4771]] more, [[G4057]] will [you] love me [[G25]] less? [[G2276]]

### 16
Be that as it may, [[G1510]] I [[G1473]] was not a burden [[G2599]] to you; [[G4771]] but [[G235]] crafty [[G3835]] as I am, [[G5225]] I caught [[G2983]] you [[G4771]] by trickery. [[G1388]]

### 17
Did I overreach [[G4122]] by [[G1223]] anyone [[G5100]] I sent [[G649]] you? [[G4771]]

### 18
I urged [[G3870]] Titus [to visit you], [[G5103]] and [[G2532]] I sent [[G4882]] [our] [[G3588]] brother [with him]. [[G80]] {Did} Titus [[G5103]] exploit [[G4122]] you [[G4771]] [in any way]? [[G3385]] Did we not walk [[G4043]] in the [[G3588]] same [[G846]] spirit [[G4151]] [and follow] [[G3756]] in the [[G3588]] same [[G846]] footsteps? [[G2487]]

### 19
Have you been thinking [[G1380]] all along [[G3819]] that [[G3754]] we were making a defense [[G626]] to you? [[G4771]] We speak [[G2980]] before [[G2713]] God [[G2316]] in [[G1722]] Christ, [[G5547]] and [[G1161]] all [[G3956]] of [this], [[G3588]] beloved, [[G27]] [is] [[G5228]] to build you up. [[G3619]]

### 20
For [[G1063]] I am afraid [[G5399]] [that] [[G3361]] when I come, [[G2064]] I may not find [[G2147]] you [[G4771]] as [[G3634]] I wish, [[G2309]] and [[G2504]] you [[G4771]] may not find {me} [[G2147]] as [[G3634]] you wish. [[G2309]] [I fear] [[G3361]] that there may be [[G4459]] quarreling, [[G2054]] jealousy, [[G2205]] rage, [[G2372]] rivalry, [[G2052]] slander, [[G2636]] gossip, [[G5587]] arrogance, [[G5450]] [and] disorder. [[G181]]

### 21
[I am afraid that] [[G3361]] when I come [[G2064]] again, [[G3825]] my [[G1473]] God [[G2316]] will humble [[G5013]] me [[G1473]] before [[G4314]] you, [[G4771]] and [[G2532]] I will be grieved over [[G3996]] many [[G4183]] who [[G3588]] have sinned earlier [[G4258]] and [[G2532]] have not repented [[G3340]] of [[G1909]] their acts of [[G4238]] impurity, [[G167]] sexual immorality, [[G4202]] and [[G2532]] debauchery.
