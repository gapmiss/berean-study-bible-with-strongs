###### 1
Now [[G1161]] by [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] mildness [[G4240]] and [[G2532]] gentleness [[G1932]] of Christ, [[G5547]] I appeal [[G3870]] to you— [[G4771]] I, [[G1473]] Paul, [[G3972]] who [[G3739]] [am] humble [[G5011]] when face to face [[G4383]] with [[G1722]] you, [[G4771]] but [[G1161]] bold [[G2292]] when away. [[G548]]

###### 2
I beg [you] [[G1189]] that [[G3588]] when I come, [[G3918]] I may not need to be [[G2292]] as bold [[G4006]] as [[G3739]] I expect [[G3049]] toward [[G1909]] [those] [[G5100]] who [[G3588]] presume that [[G3049]] we [[G1473]] live [[G4043]] according to [[G2596]] [the] flesh. [[G4561]]

###### 3
For [[G1063]] though we live [[G4043]] in [[G1722]] [the] flesh, [[G4561]] we do not wage war [[G4754]] according to [[G2596]] [the] flesh. [[G4561]]

###### 4
The [[G3588]] weapons [[G3696]] of [[G3588]] our [[G1473]] warfare [[G4752]] [are] not [[G3756]] [ the weapons ] of the world. [[G4559]] Instead, [[G235]] [they have] [[G3588]] divine [[G2316]] power [[G1415]] to [[G4314]] demolish [[G2506]] strongholds. [[G3794]]

###### 5
We tear down [[G2507]] arguments, [[G3053]] and [[G2532]] every [[G3956]] presumption [[G5313]] set up [[G1869]] against [[G2596]] the [[G3588]] knowledge [[G1108]] of God; [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] we take captive [[G163]] every [[G3956]] thought [[G3540]] to [[G1519]] make it obedient [[G5218]] to Christ. [[G5547]]

###### 6
And [[G2532]] we [[G1722]] will be [[G2192]] ready [[G2092]] to punish [[G1556]] every [act of] [[G3956]] disobedience, [[G3876]] as soon as [[G3752]] your [[G4771]] obedience [[G5218]] is complete. [[G4137]]

###### 7
You are looking [[G991]] at [[G2596]] outward appearances. [[G4383]] If [[G1487]] anyone [[G5100]] is confident [[G3982]] that he [[G1438]] belongs to [[G1510]] Christ, [[G5547]] he should remind [[G3049]] himself [[G1438]] that [[G3754]] we [[G1473]] [belong to Christ] [[G3779]] just [[G2532]] as much as [[G2531]] he [[G846]] [does]. [[G5547]]

###### 8
For [[G1063]] even [[G5037]] if [[G1437]] I boast [[G2744]] somewhat [[G5100]] excessively [[G4053]] about [[G4012]] the [[G3588]] authority [[G1849]] the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] gave [[G1325]] us [[G1473]] for [[G1519]] building [you] up [[G3619]] rather than [[G2532]] tearing you down, [[G2506]] I will not be ashamed. [[G153]]

###### 9
I do not want to seem [[G1380]] to be [[G5613]] [trying] to frighten [[G1629]] you [[G4771]] by [[G1223]] [my] [[G3588]] letters. [[G1992]]

###### 10
For [[G3754]] [some] say, [[G5346]] “[His] [[G3588]] letters [[G1992]] [are] weighty [[G926]] and [[G2532]] forceful, [[G2478]] but [[G1161]] his [[G3588]] physical [[G4983]] presence [[G3952]] [is] unimpressive, [[G772]] and [[G2532]] [his] [[G3588]] speaking [[G3056]] [is] of no account.” [[G1848]]

###### 11
Such [people] [[G5108]] should consider [[G3049]] that [[G3754]] what [[G3634]] we are [[G1510]] in [[G1223]] [our] letters [[G1992]] when absent, [[G548]] [we will be] [[G5108]] in our actions [[G2041]] when present. [[G3918]]

###### 12
We do not dare [[G5111]] to classify [[G1469]] or [[G2228]] compare [[G4793]] ourselves [with] [[G1438]] some [[G5100]] who [[G3588]] commend [[G4921]] themselves. [[G1438]] [When] they [[G846]] measure [[G3354]] themselves [[G1438]] by [[G1722]] themselves [[G1438]] and [[G2532]] compare [[G4793]] themselves [[G1438]] with themselves, [[G1438]] they show their ignorance. [[G4920]]

###### 13
We, [[G1473]] however, [[G1161]] will not boast [[G2744]] beyond our limits, [[G280]] but only [[G235]] within [[G2596]] the [[G3588]] field of influence [[G3358]] that [[G3739]] God [[G2316]] has assigned [[G3307]] to us— [[G1473]] a field [[G3358]] that reaches [[G2185]] even [[G2532]] to [[G891]] you. [[G4771]]

###### 14
We are not overstepping [[G5239]] our [bounds], [[G1438]] as if [[G5613]] we had not come [[G2185]] to [[G1519]] you. [[G4771]] Indeed, [[G1063]] we were the first to reach [[G5348]] you [[G4771]] with [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] gospel [[G2098]] of Christ. [[G5547]]

###### 15
Neither [[G3756]] do we boast [[G2744]] beyond our limits [[G280]] in [[G1722]] [the] labors [[G2873]] of others. [[G245]] But [[G1161]] we hope that, [[G1680]] [as] your [[G4771]] faith [[G4102]] increases, [[G837]] our [[G1473]] area of influence [[G2583]] among [[G1722]] you [[G4771]] will greatly increase [ as well ], [[G3170]]

###### 16
so that [[G1519]] we can preach the gospel [[G2097]] [in the regions] [[G3588]] beyond [[G5238]] you. [[G4771]] [Then] we will not be boasting [[G2744]] in [[G1722]] the [work] [[G3588]] already done [[G2092]] in [[G1519]] another man’s [[G245]] territory. [[G2583]]

###### 17
Rather, [[G1161]] “{Let} him who [[G3588]] boasts [[G2744]] boast [[G2744]] in [[G1722]] [the] Lord.” [[G2962]]

###### 18
For [[G1063]] it is [[G1510]] not [[G3756]] the [one] [[G3588]] who commends [[G4921]] himself [[G1438]] [who is] [[G1565]] approved, [[G1384]] but [[G235]] the one whom [[G3739]] the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] commends. [[G4921]]
