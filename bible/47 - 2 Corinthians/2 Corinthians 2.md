### 1
[So] [[G1063]] I made up my mind [[G2919]] not [[G3361]] to make [[G2064]] another [[G3825]] painful {visit} [[G3077]] to [[G4314]] you. [[G4771]]

### 2
For [[G1063]] if [[G1487]] I [[G1473]] grieve [[G3076]] you, [[G4771]] who [[G5101]] [is left] [[G3588]] to cheer [[G2165]] me [[G1473]] but [[G1487]] those [whom] [[G3588]] I [[G1473]] have grieved? [[G3076]]

### 3
I wrote [[G1125]] as I did [[G3778]] so that [[G2443]] on my arrival [[G2064]] I would not be [[G2192]] saddened [[G3077]] by [those] [[G575]] who [[G3739]] ought {to make} [[G1163]] me [[G1473]] rejoice. [[G5463]] I had confidence [[G3982]] in [[G1909]] all of [[G3956]] you, [[G4771]] that [[G3754]] you [[G4771]] [would share] [[G1510]] my [[G1699]] joy. [[G5479]]

### 4
For [[G1063]] through [[G1223]] many [[G4183]] tears [[G1144]] I wrote [[G1125]] you [[G4771]] out of [[G1537]] great [[G4183]] distress [[G2347]] and [[G2532]] anguish [[G4928]] of heart, [[G2588]] not [[G3756]] to [[G2443]] grieve you [[G3076]] but [[G235]] to [[G2443]] let you know [[G1097]] how much [[G4057]] I love you. [[G26]]

### 5
Now [[G1161]] if [[G1487]] anyone [[G5100]] has caused grief, [[G3076]] he has not grieved [[G3076]] me, [[G1473]] but [[G235]] all [[G3956]] of you— [[G4771]] to [[G575]] some degree, [[G3313]] not [[G3361]] to [[G2443]] overstate [it]. [[G1912]]

### 6
The [[G3588]] punishment [[G2009]] [imposed on him] [[G3588]] by [[G5259]] the [[G3588]] majority [[G4119]] [is] sufficient [[G2425]] for [[G3588]] him. [[G5108]]

### 7
So [[G5620]] instead, [[G5121]] you [[G4771]] ought to forgive [[G5483]] and [[G2532]] comfort [him], [[G3870]] so that [[G4459]] he [[G5108]] will not be overwhelmed [[G2666]] by [[G3588]] excessive [[G4053]] sorrow. [[G3077]]

### 8
Therefore [[G1352]] I urge [[G3870]] you [[G4771]] to reaffirm [[G2964]] [your] love [[G26]] for [[G1519]] him. [[G846]]

### 9
{My} purpose [[G1519]] in writing [you] [[G1125]] [was] to [[G2443]] see [[G1097]] if [[G1487]] you [[G4771]] would stand the test [[G1382]] [and] [[G1510]] be obedient [[G5255]] in [[G1519]] everything. [[G3956]]

### 10
If you forgive [[G5483]] anyone, [[G3739]] I also [forgive him]. [[G2504]] And [[G2532]] if [[G1487]] I have forgiven [[G5483]] anything, [[G5100]] I [[G1473]] have forgiven [[G5483]] [it] [[G3739]] in [[G1722]] [the] presence [[G4383]] of Christ [[G5547]] for your sake, [[G1223]]

### 11
in order that [[G2443]] Satan [[G4567]] should not outwit us. [[G4122]] For [[G1063]] we are not unaware [[G50]] of his [[G846]] schemes. [[G3540]]

### 12
Now [[G1161]] when I went [[G2064]] to [[G1519]] Troas [[G5174]] [to preach] [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] gospel [[G2098]] of Christ [[G5547]] and [[G2532]] a door [[G2374]] stood open [[G455]] for me [[G1473]] in [[G1722]] [the] Lord, [[G2962]]

### 13
I had [[G2192]] no [[G3756]] peace [[G425]] in [[G3588]] my [[G1473]] spirit, [[G4151]] [because] I [[G1473]] did not find [[G2147]] my [[G1473]] brother [[G80]] Titus [there]. [[G5103]] [So] [[G235]] I said goodbye [[G657]] to them [[G846]] [and] went on [[G1831]] to [[G1519]] Macedonia. [[G3109]]

### 14
But [[G1161]] thanks [be] [[G5485]] to [[G3588]] God, [[G2316]] who [[G3588]] always [[G3842]] leads us triumphantly as captives [[G2358]] in [[G1722]] Christ [[G5547]] and [[G2532]] through [[G1223]] us [[G1473]] spreads [[G5319]] everywhere [[G5117]] the [[G3588]] fragrance [[G3744]] of [[G3588]] [the] knowledge [[G1108]] of Him. [[G846]]

### 15
For [[G3754]] we are [[G1510]] to God [[G2316]] [the] sweet aroma [[G2175]] of Christ [[G5547]] among [[G1722]] those who are [[G3588]] being saved [[G4982]] and [[G2532]] those who are [[G3588]] perishing. [[G622]]

### 16
To [the] one, [[G3739]] [we are] [[G3303]] an odor [[G3744]] of [[G1537]] death [[G2288]] [and] [[G1519]] demise; [[G2288]] to the other, [[G3739]] a fragrance [[G3744]] that brings life. [[G2222]] And [[G2532]] who [is] [[G5101]] qualified [[G2425]] for [[G4314]] such [a task]? [[G3778]]

### 17
For [[G1063]] we are [[G1510]] not [[G3756]] like [[G5613]] so many others, [[G4183]] who [[G3588]] peddle [[G2585]] the [[G3588]] word [[G3056]] of God {for profit}. [[G2316]] On the contrary, [[G235]] in [[G1722]] Christ [[G5547]] we speak [[G2980]] before [[G2713]] God [[G2316]] with [[G5613]] sincerity, [[G1505]] as [[G5613]] men sent from [[G1537]] God. [[G2316]]
