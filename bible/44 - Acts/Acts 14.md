### 1
At [[G1722]] Iconium, [[G2430]] [Paul and Barnabas] [[G846]] entered [[G1525]] the [[G3588]] Jewish [[G2453]] synagogue [[G4864]] as usual, [[G2596]] and [[G2532]] they spoke [[G2980]] so [ well ] [[G3779]] that [[G5620]] a great [[G4183]] number [[G4128]] of [[G5037]] Jews [[G2453]] and [[G2532]] Greeks [[G1672]] believed. [[G4100]]

### 2
But [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] unbelieving [[G544]] Jews [[G2453]] stirred up [[G1892]] the [[G3588]] Gentiles [[G1484]] and [[G2532]] poisoned [[G2559]] [their] [[G3588]] minds [[G5590]] against [[G2596]] the [[G3588]] brothers. [[G80]]

### 3
So [[G3767]] [Paul and Barnabas] spent [[G1304]] considerable [[G2425]] time {there}, [[G5550]] speaking boldly [[G3955]] for [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] Lord, [[G2962]] who [[G3588]] affirmed [[G3140]] the [[G3588]] message [[G3056]] of [[G3588]] His [[G846]] grace [[G5485]] by enabling [[G1325]] them [[G5495]] to perform [[G1096]] signs [[G4592]] and [[G2532]] wonders. [[G5059]]

### 4
The [[G3588]] people [[G4128]] of the [[G3588]] city [[G4172]] were divided. [[G4977]] [Some] [[G3588]] sided [[G1510]] with [[G4862]] the [[G3588]] Jews, [[G2453]] and [[G1161]] [others] [[G3588]] with [[G4862]] the [[G3588]] apostles. [[G652]]

### 5
But [[G1161]] when [[G5613]] the [[G3588]] Gentiles [[G1484]] and [[G2532]] Jews, [[G2453]] together [[G5037]] with [[G4862]] their [[G846]] rulers, [[G758]] set out [[G3730]] to mistreat [[G5195]] and [[G2532]] stone [[G3036]] them, [[G846]]

### 6
they found out about it [[G4894]] and fled [[G2703]] to [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] Lycaonian [[G3071]] cities [[G4172]] of Lystra [[G3082]] and [[G2532]] Derbe, [[G1191]] and [[G2532]] to the [[G3588]] surrounding region, [[G4066]]

### 7
where [[G2546]] they continued [[G1510]] to preach the gospel. [[G2097]]

### 8
In [[G1722]] Lystra [[G3082]] sat [[G2521]] a [[G5100]] man [[G435]] crippled [[G102]] in [his] [[G3588]] feet, [[G4228]] who was lame [[G5560]] from [[G1537]] birth [[G2836]] [and] [[G3739]] {had} never [[G3763]] walked. [[G4043]]

### 9
This [man] [[G3778]] was listening to [[G191]] the words of [[G2980]] Paul, [[G3972]] who [[G3739]] looked intently [[G816]] at him [[G846]] and [[G2532]] saw [[G3708]] that [[G3754]] he had [[G2192]] faith [[G4102]] to be healed. [[G4982]]

### 10
In a loud [[G3173]] voice [[G5456]] [Paul] called out, [[G2036]] “Stand [[G450]] up [[G3717]] on [[G1909]] your [[G4771]] feet!” [[G4228]] And [[G2532]] [the man] jumped up [[G242]] and [[G2532]] began to walk. [[G4043]]

### 11
[When] [[G5037]] the [[G3588]] crowds [[G3793]] saw [[G3708]] what [[G3739]] Paul [[G3972]] had done, [[G4160]] they lifted up [[G1869]] their [[G846]] voices [[G5456]] in the Lycaonian language: [[G3072]] “The [[G3588]] gods [[G2316]] have come down [[G2597]] to [[G4314]] us [[G1473]] in human form!” [[G3666]]

### 12
Barnabas [[G921]] they called [[G2564]] Zeus, [[G2203]] and [[G1161]] Paul [[G3972]] [they called] Hermes, [[G2060]] because [[G1894]] he [[G846]] was [[G1510]] the [[G3588]] chief [[G2233]] speaker. [[G3056]]

### 13
The [[G3588]] priest [[G2409]] of Zeus, [[G2203]] [whose temple] was [[G1510]] just outside [[G4253]] the [[G3588]] city, [[G4172]] brought [[G5342]] bulls [[G5022]] and [[G2532]] wreaths [[G4725]] to [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] [city] gates, [[G4440]] hoping [[G2309]] to offer a sacrifice [[G2380]] along with [[G4862]] the [[G3588]] crowds. [[G3793]]

### 14
But [[G1161]] [when] the [[G3588]] apostles [[G652]] Barnabas [[G921]] and [[G2532]] Paul [[G3972]] found out about this, [[G191]] they tore [[G1284]] their [[G846]] clothes [[G2440]] [and] rushed [[G1530]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] crowd, [[G3793]] shouting, [[G2896]]

### 15
“Men, [[G435]] why [[G5101]] are you doing [[G4160]] this? [[G3778]] We [[G1473]] too [[G2532]] are [only] [[G1510]] men, [[G444]] human [[G3663]] like you. [[G4771]] We are bringing you good news [[G2097]] that you should turn [[G1994]] from [[G575]] these [[G3778]] worthless things [[G3152]] to [[G1909]] [the] living [[G2198]] God, [[G2316]] who [[G3739]] made [[G4160]] heaven [[G3772]] and [[G2532]] earth [[G1093]] and [[G2532]] sea [[G2281]] and [[G2532]] everything [[G3588]] in [[G1722]] them. [[G846]]

### 16
In [[G1722]] past [[G3944]] generations, [[G1074]] [He] [[G3739]] let [[G1439]] all [[G3956]] nations [[G1484]] go [[G4198]] their [[G846]] [own] [[G3588]] way. [[G3598]]

### 17
Yet [[G2543]] He has not left [[G863]] Himself [[G848]] without testimony [[G267]] to His goodness: [[G14]] He gives [[G1325]] you [[G4771]] rain [[G5205]] from heaven [[G3771]] and [[G2532]] fruitful [[G2593]] seasons, [[G2540]] filling [[G1705]] your [[G4771]] hearts [[G2588]] with food [[G5160]] and [[G2532]] gladness.” [[G2167]]

### 18
Even [[G2532]] with these [[G3778]] words, [[G3004]] [Paul and Barnabas] could hardly stop [[G2664]] the [[G3588]] crowds [[G3793]] from [[G3588]] sacrificing [[G2380]] to them. [[G846]]

### 19
Then [[G1161]] [some] Jews [[G2453]] arrived [[G1904]] from [[G575]] Antioch [[G490]] and [[G2532]] Iconium [[G2430]] and [[G2532]] won [[G3982]] the [[G3588]] crowds {over}. [[G3793]] They stoned [[G3034]] Paul [[G3972]] [and] dragged [him] [[G4951]] outside [[G1854]] the [[G3588]] city, [[G4172]] presuming [[G3543]] he [[G846]] was dead. [[G2348]]

### 20
But [after] [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] disciples [[G3101]] had gathered around [[G2944]] him, [[G846]] he got up [[G450]] and went back into [[G1525]] the [[G3588]] city. [[G4172]] And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] next day [[G1887]] he left [[G1831]] with [[G4862]] Barnabas [[G921]] for [[G1519]] Derbe. [[G1191]]

### 21
They preached the gospel to [[G2097]] that [[G1565]] city [[G4172]] and [[G2532]] made many disciples. [[G3100]] [Then] they returned [[G5290]] to [[G1519]] Lystra, [[G3082]] Iconium, [[G2430]] and [[G2532]] Antioch, [[G490]]

### 22
strengthening [[G1991]] the [[G3588]] souls [[G5590]] of the [[G3588]] disciples [[G3101]] [and] encouraging [them] [[G3870]] to continue [[G1696]] in the [[G3588]] faith. [[G4102]] “We [[G1473]] must [[G1163]] endure [[G1223]] many [[G4183]] hardships [[G2347]] to enter [[G1525]] the [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] of God,” [[G2316]] [they said]. [[G3754]]

### 23
[Paul and Barnabas] appointed [[G5500]] elders [[G4245]] for them [[G846]] in each [[G2596]] church, [[G1577]] praying [[G4336]] [and] [[G3326]] fasting [[G3521]] as they entrusted [[G3908]] them [[G846]] to the [[G3588]] Lord, [[G2962]] in [[G1519]] whom [[G3739]] they had believed. [[G4100]]

### 24
[After] [[G2532]] passing through [[G1330]] Pisidia, [[G4099]] they came [[G2064]] to [[G1519]] Pamphylia. [[G3828]]

### 25
And [when] [[G2532]] they had spoken [[G2980]] the [[G3588]] word [[G3056]] in [[G1722]] Perga, [[G4011]] they went down [[G2597]] to [[G1519]] Attalia. [[G825]]

### 26
From [Attalia] [[G2547]] they sailed [[G636]] to [[G1519]] Antioch, [[G490]] where [[G3606]] they had [[G1510]] been commended [[G3860]] to the [[G3588]] grace [[G5485]] of God [[G2316]] for [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] work [[G2041]] they had just completed. [[G4137]]

### 27
[When] [[G1161]] they arrived, [[G3854]] they gathered [[G4863]] the [[G3588]] church {together} [[G1577]] [and] reported [[G312]] all that [[G3745]] God [[G2316]] had done [[G4160]] through [[G3326]] them, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] how [[G3754]] He had opened [[G455]] [the] door [[G2374]] of faith [[G4102]] to the [[G3588]] Gentiles. [[G1484]]

### 28
And [[G1161]] they spent [[G1304]] a long [[G3641]] time [there] [[G5550]] with [[G4862]] the [[G3588]] disciples. [[G3101]]
