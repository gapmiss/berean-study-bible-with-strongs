### 1
Now [[G1161]] a [[G5100]] man [[G435]] named [[G3686]] Ananias, [[G367]] together with [[G4862]] his [[G846]] wife [[G1135]] Sapphira, [[G4551]] [also] sold [[G4453]] a piece of property. [[G2933]]

### 2
[With] [[G2532]] [his] [[G3588]] wife’s [[G1135]] full knowledge, [[G4894]] he kept back [[G3557]] [some] of [[G575]] the [[G3588]] proceeds [for himself], [[G5092]] [but] [[G2532]] brought [[G5342]] a [[G5100]] portion [[G3313]] [and] laid [it] [[G5087]] at [[G3844]] the [[G3588]] apostles’ [[G652]] feet. [[G4228]]

### 3
Then [[G1161]] Peter [[G4074]] said, [[G2036]] “Ananias, [[G367]] how is it that [[G1223]] Satan [[G4567]] has filled [[G4137]] your [[G4771]] heart [[G2588]] to lie [[G5574]] to the [[G3588]] Holy [[G40]] Spirit [[G4151]] and [[G2532]] withhold [[G3557]] [some] of [[G575]] the [[G3588]] proceeds [[G5092]] from the [[G3588]] land? [[G5564]]

### 4
Did it not belong [[G3306]] to you [[G4771]] before it was sold? [[G3306]] And [[G2532]] after it was sold, [[G4097]] was it [not] [[G5225]] at [[G1722]] [your] [[G4674]] disposal? [[G1849]] How [[G5101]] could you conceive [[G5087]] such [[G3778]] a deed [[G4229]] in [[G1722]] your [[G4771]] heart? [[G2588]] You have not lied [[G5574]] to men, [[G444]] but [[G235]] to God!” [[G2316]]

### 5
On hearing [[G191]] these [[G3778]] words, [[G3056]] Ananias [[G367]] fell down [[G4098]] [and] died. [[G1634]] And [[G2532]] great [[G3173]] fear [[G5401]] came [[G1096]] over [[G1909]] all [[G3956]] who [[G3588]] heard [what had happened]. [[G191]]

### 6
Then [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] young [men] [[G3501]] stepped forward, [[G450]] wrapped up [[G4958]] his [body], [[G846]] and [[G2532]] carried [him] out [[G1627]] [and] buried [him]. [[G2290]]

### 7
About [[G5613]] three [[G5140]] hours [[G5610]] later [[G1292]] his [[G846]] wife [[G1135]] also [[G2532]] came in, [[G1525]] unaware of [[G1492]] what [[G3588]] had happened. [[G1096]]

### 8
“Tell [[G2036]] me,” [[G1473]] said [[G611]] Peter, [[G4074]] “[is this] [[G1487]] the price [[G5118]] you [and your husband ] got [[G591]] for the [[G3588]] land?” [[G5564]] “Yes,” [[G3483]] she answered, [[G2036]] “that is the price.” [[G5118]]

### 9
“How [[G5101]] could you [[G4771]] agree [[G4856]] to test [[G3985]] the [[G3588]] Spirit [[G4151]] of [the] Lord?” [[G2962]] Peter [replied]. [[G4074]] “Look, [[G2400]] the [[G3588]] feet [[G4228]] of the [men who] [[G3588]] buried [[G2290]] your [[G4771]] husband [[G435]] [are] at [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] door, [[G2374]] and [[G2532]] they will carry you out [also].” [[G1627]]

### 10
At that instant [[G3916]] she fell down [[G4098]] at [[G4314]] his [[G846]] feet [[G4228]] and [[G2532]] died. [[G1634]] Then [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] young [men] [[G3495]] came in [[G1525]] [and] found [[G2147]] her [[G846]] dead. [[G3498]] [So] [[G2532]] they carried [her] out [[G1627]] [and] buried [her] [[G2290]] beside [[G4314]] her [[G846]] husband. [[G435]]

### 11
And [[G2532]] great [[G3173]] fear [[G5401]] came [[G1096]] over [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] whole [[G3650]] church [[G1577]] and [[G2532]] all [[G3956]] who [[G3588]] heard about [[G191]] these [events]. [[G3778]]

### 12
The [[G3588]] apostles [[G652]] performed [[G1096]] many [[G4183]] signs [[G4592]] and [[G2532]] wonders [[G5059]] among [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] people, [[G2992]] and [[G2532]] with one accord [[G3661]] [the believers gathered together] [[G1510]] in [[G1722]] Solomon’s [[G4672]] Colonnade. [[G4745]]

### 13
Although [[G235]] the [[G3588]] people [[G2992]] regarded them highly, [[G3170]] no one [[G3762]] else [[G3062]] dared [[G5111]] to join [[G2853]] them. [[G846]]

### 14
Yet [[G1161]] more and more [[G3123]] believers [[G4100]] were brought [[G4369]] to the [[G3588]] Lord— [[G2962]] large numbers [[G4128]] of both [[G5037]] men [[G435]] and [[G2532]] women. [[G1135]]

### 15
As a result, [[G5620]] [people] brought [[G1627]] the [[G3588]] sick [[G772]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] streets [[G4113]] and [[G2532]] laid [them] [[G5087]] on [[G1909]] cots [[G2826]] and [[G2532]] mats, [[G2895]] so that [[G2443]] at least [[G2579]] Peter’s [[G4074]] shadow [[G4639]] might fall on [[G1982]] some [[G5100]] of them [[G846]] as he passed by. [[G2064]]

### 16
Crowds [[G4128]] also [[G2532]] gathered [[G4905]] from the [[G3588]] towns [[G4172]] around [[G4038]] Jerusalem, [[G2419]] bringing [[G5342]] [the] sick [[G772]] and [[G2532]] [those] tormented [[G3791]] by [[G5259]] unclean [[G169]] spirits, [[G4151]] [and] [[G3748]] all [of them] [[G537]] were healed. [[G2323]]

### 17
Then [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] high priest [[G749]] and [[G2532]] all [[G3956]] his associates [[G3588]] (who [[G3588]] belonged [[G1510]] to the [[G3588]] party [[G139]] of the Sadducees) [[G4523]] rose up [[G450]] with [[G4130]] jealousy. [[G2205]]

### 18
They arrested [[G1911]] the [[G3588]] apostles [[G652]] and [[G2532]] put [[G5087]] them [[G846]] in [[G1722]] [the] public [[G1219]] jail. [[G5084]]

### 19
But [[G1161]] during [[G1223]] the night [[G3571]] an angel [[G32]] of [the] Lord [[G2962]] opened [[G455]] the [[G3588]] doors [[G2374]] of the [[G3588]] jail [[G5438]] [and] brought them out, [[G1806]] saying, [[G2036]]

### 20
“Go, [[G4198]] stand [[G2476]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] temple courts [[G2411]] [and] tell [[G2980]] the [[G3588]] people [[G2992]] the [[G3588]] full [[G3956]] message [[G4487]] of [[G3588]] this [[G3778]] [new] life.” [[G2222]]

### 21
At [[G5259]] daybreak, [[G3722]] [the apostles] entered [[G1525]] the [[G3588]] temple courts [[G2411]] as they had been told [[G191]] and [[G2532]] began to teach [the people]. [[G1321]] [When] [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] high priest [[G749]] and [[G2532]] his associates [[G3588]] arrived [[G3854]] in the [[G3588]] Council, [[G4892]] they called together [[G4779]] the [[G3588]] full [[G3956]] assembly [[G1087]] of the [[G3588]] elders of Israel, [[G2474]] and [[G2532]] sent [[G649]] to [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] jail [[G1201]] [for] [[G71]] [the apostles]. [[G846]]

### 22
But [[G1161]] on arriving [[G3854]] at [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] jail, [[G5438]] the [[G3588]] officers [[G5257]] did not find [[G2147]] them [there]. [[G846]] [So] [[G1161]] they returned [[G390]] with the report: [[G518]]

### 23
“We found [[G2147]] the [[G3588]] jail [[G1201]] securely [[G803]] locked, [[G2808]] [with] [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] guards [[G5441]] posted [[G2476]] at [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] doors; [[G2374]] but [[G1161]] when we opened [them], [[G455]] we found [[G2147]] no one [[G3762]] inside.” [[G2080]]

### 24
[When] [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] captain [[G4755]] of the [[G3588]] temple [guard] [[G2411]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] chief priests [[G749]] heard [[G191]] this [[G3778]] account, [[G3056]] they were perplexed [[G1280]] as to [[G4012]] what [[G5101]] was happening. [[G1096]]

### 25
Then [[G1161]] someone [[G5100]] came in [[G3854]] [and] announced, [[G518]] “Look, [[G2400]] the [[G3588]] men [[G435]] you put [[G5087]] in [[G1722]] jail [[G5438]] are [[G1510]] standing [[G2476]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] temple courts, [[G2411]] teaching [[G1321]] the [[G3588]] people!” [[G2992]]

### 26
At that point, [[G5119]] the [[G3588]] captain [[G4755]] went [[G565]] with [[G4862]] the [[G3588]] officers [[G5257]] [and] brought [[G71]] [the apostles]— [[G846]] [but] not [[G3756]] by [[G3326]] force, [[G970]] for [[G1063]] fear [[G5399]] the [[G3588]] people [[G2992]] would stone [them]. [[G3034]]

### 27
They brought them in [[G71]] [and] made [them] stand [[G2476]] before [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] Sanhedrin, [[G4892]] [where] [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] high priest [[G749]] interrogated [[G1905]] them. [[G846]]

### 28
“We gave you strict orders [[G3852]] not [[G3361]] to teach [[G1321]] in [[G1909]] this [[G3778]] name,” [[G3686]] he said. [[G3004]] “Yet [[G2532]] you have filled [[G4137]] Jerusalem [[G2419]] with [[G3588]] your [[G4771]] teaching [[G1322]] and [[G2532]] are determined [[G1014]] to make us responsible for [[G1863]] this [[G3778]] man’s [[G444]] blood.” [[G129]]

### 29
But [[G1161]] Peter [[G4074]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] other apostles [[G652]] replied, [[G611]] “We must obey [[G3980]] God [[G2316]] rather [[G3123]] than [[G2228]] men. [[G444]]

### 30
The [[G3588]] God [[G2316]] of [[G3588]] our [[G1473]] fathers [[G3962]] raised up [[G1453]] Jesus, [[G2424]] whom [[G3739]] you [[G4771]] had killed [[G1315]] by hanging [Him] [[G2910]] on [[G1909]] a tree. [[G3586]]

### 31
God [[G2316]] exalted [[G5312]] Him [[G3778]] to [[G3588]] His [[G846]] right hand [[G1188]] [as] Prince [[G747]] and [[G2532]] Savior, [[G4990]] [ in order ] to grant [[G1325]] repentance [[G3341]] and [[G2532]] forgiveness [[G859]] of sins [[G266]] to Israel. [[G2474]]

### 32
We [[G1473]] are [[G1510]] witnesses [[G3144]] of [[G3588]] these [[G3778]] things, [[G4487]] and so [is] [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] Holy [[G40]] Spirit, [[G4151]] whom [[G3739]] God [[G2316]] has given [[G1325]] to those who [[G3588]] obey [[G3980]] Him.” [[G846]]

### 33
When [the Council members] heard this, [[G191]] they were enraged [[G1282]] and [[G2532]] wanted [[G1014]] to put [the apostles] to death. [[G337]]

### 34
But [[G1161]] a [[G5100]] Pharisee [[G5330]] named [[G3686]] Gamaliel, [[G1059]] a teacher of the Law [[G3547]] who was honored [[G5093]] by all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] people, [[G2992]] stood up [[G450]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] Sanhedrin [[G4892]] [and] ordered that [[G2753]] the [[G3588]] men [[G444]] be put [[G4160]] outside [[G1854]] for a short time. [[G1024]]

### 35
“Men [[G435]] of Israel,” [[G2475]] he said, [[G2036]] “consider carefully [[G4337]] what [[G5101]] you are about [[G3195]] to do [[G4238]] to [[G1909]] these [[G3778]] men. [[G444]]

### 36
Some time ago [[G4253]] Theudas [[G2333]] rose up, [[G450]] claiming [[G3004]] to be [[G1510]] somebody, [[G5100]] [and] [[G3739]] about [[G5613]] four hundred [[G5071]] men [[G435]] joined [him]. [[G4346]] [He] [[G3739]] was killed, [[G337]] all [[G3956]] his followers [[G3745]] were dispersed, [[G1262]] and [[G2532]] it all came [[G1096]] to [[G1519]] nothing. [[G3762]]

### 37
After [[G3326]] [him], [[G3778]] Judas [[G2455]] the [[G3588]] Galilean [[G1057]] appeared [[G450]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] days [[G2250]] of the [[G3588]] census [[G582]] and [[G2532]] drew away [[G868]] people [[G2992]] after [[G3694]] him. [[G846]] He too [[G2548]] perished, [[G622]] and [[G2532]] all [[G3956]] his followers [[G3745]] were scattered. [[G1287]]

### 38
So [[G2532]] in the present [case] [[G3568]] I advise [[G3004]] you: [[G4771]] Leave [[G868]] these [[G3778]] men {alone}. [[G444]] Let them go! [[G863]] For [[G3754]] if [[G1437]] [their] [[G3778]] purpose [[G1012]] or [[G2228]] endeavor [[G2041]] is [[G1510]] of [[G1537]] human origin, [[G444]] it will fail. [[G2647]]

### 39
But [[G1161]] if [[G1487]] it is [[G1510]] from [[G1537]] God, [[G2316]] you will not be able [[G1410]] to stop [[G2647]] them. [[G846]] You may even find yourselves [[G2147]] fighting against God.” [[G2314]]

### 40
At this, [[G1161]] they yielded [[G3982]] to [Gamaliel]. [[G846]] They called [[G4341]] the [[G3588]] apostles [in] [[G652]] and had them flogged. [[G1194]] Then [[G2532]] they ordered [them] [[G3853]] not [[G3361]] to speak [[G2980]] in [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] name [[G3686]] of Jesus, [[G2424]] [and] released [them]. [[G630]]

### 41
[The apostles] [[G3588]] left [[G4198]] the [[G3588]] Sanhedrin, [[G4892]] rejoicing [[G5463]] that [[G3754]] they had been counted worthy [[G2661]] of suffering disgrace [[G818]] for [[G5228]] the [[G3588]] Name. [[G3686]]

### 42
Every [[G3956]] day, [[G2250]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] temple [courts] [[G2411]] and [[G2532]] from [[G2596]] house [to house], [[G3624]] they did not stop [[G3973]] teaching [[G1321]] and [[G2532]] proclaiming the good news that [[G2097]] Jesus [[G2424]] [is] the [[G3588]] Christ. [[G5547]]
