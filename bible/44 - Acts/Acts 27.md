###### 1
When [[G5613]] it was decided [[G2919]] [that] [[G3588]] we [[G1473]] would sail [[G636]] for [[G1519]] Italy, [[G2482]] Paul [[G3972]] and [[G2532]] some [[G5100]] other [[G2087]] prisoners [[G1202]] were handed over [[G3860]] to a centurion [[G1543]] named [[G3686]] Julius, [[G2457]] [who belonged to the] Augustan [[G4575]] Regiment. [[G4686]]

###### 2
We boarded [[G1910]] an Adramyttian [[G98]] ship [[G4143]] about [[G3195]] to sail [[G4126]] for [[G1519]] ports [[G5117]] along [[G2596]] [the coast of] Asia, [[G773]] [and] we put out to sea. [[G321]] Aristarchus, [[G708]] a Macedonian [[G3110]] from Thessalonica, [[G2331]] was [[G1510]] with [[G4862]] us. [[G1473]]

###### 3
The [[G3588]] next [day] [[G2087]] we landed [[G2609]] at [[G1519]] Sidon, [[G4605]] and [[G5037]] Julius [[G2457]] treated [[G5530]] Paul [[G3972]] with consideration, [[G5364]] allowing [him] [[G2010]] to visit [[G4198]] his [[G3588]] friends [[G5384]] [and] receive [[G5177]] [their] care. [[G1958]]

###### 4
[After] putting out [[G321]] from there, [[G2547]] we sailed to the lee [[G5284]] of Cyprus [[G2954]] because [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] winds [[G417]] were [[G1510]] against us. [[G1727]]

###### 5
And [when] [[G5037]] we had sailed across the open sea [[G1277]] off the coast [[G2596]] of Cilicia [[G2791]] and [[G2532]] Pamphylia, [[G3828]] we came [[G2718]] to [[G1519]] Myra [[G3460]] in Lycia. [[G3073]]

###### 6
There [[G2546]] the [[G3588]] centurion [[G1543]] found [[G2147]] an Alexandrian [[G222]] ship [[G4143]] sailing [[G4126]] for [[G1519]] Italy, [[G2482]] [and] he put [[G1688]] us [[G1473]] on [[G1519]] [board]. [[G846]]

###### 7
[After] [[G1161]] sailing slowly [[G1020]] for [[G1722]] many [[G2425]] days, [[G2250]] we arrived [[G1096]] off [[G2596]] Cnidus. [[G2834]] [When] the [[G3588]] wind [[G417]] impeded [[G4330]] us, [[G1473]] we sailed to the lee [[G5284]] of Crete, [[G2914]] opposite [[G2596]] Salmone. [[G4534]]

###### 8
[After] [[G5037]] we had moved along the coast [[G3881]] with difficulty, [[G3433]] we came [[G2064]] to [[G1519]] a [[G5100]] place [[G5117]] called [[G2564]] Fair [[G2570]] Havens, [[G3040]] near [[G1451]] [the] town [[G4172]] of Lasea. [[G2996]]

###### 9
By now [[G1161]] much [[G2425]] time [[G5550]] had passed, [[G1230]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] voyage [[G4144]] had already become [[G1510]] dangerous [[G2000]] because [[G1223]] it was after [[G3928]] the [[G3588]] Fast. [[G3521]] [So] Paul [[G3972]] advised [them], [[G3867]]

###### 10
“Men, [[G435]] I can see [[G2334]] that [[G3754]] [our] [[G3588]] voyage [[G4144]] will [[G3195]] be [filled] [[G1510]] with [[G3326]] disaster [[G5196]] and [[G2532]] great [[G4183]] loss, [[G2209]] not [[G3756]] only [[G3440]] to [[G3588]] ship [[G4143]] and [[G2532]] cargo, [[G5413]] but [[G235]] to our [[G1473]] [own] [[G3588]] lives [[G5590]] as well. [[G2532]]

###### 11
But [[G1161]] contrary to [[G3123]] Paul’s [[G3972]] advice, [[G3004]] the [[G3588]] centurion [[G1543]] was persuaded [[G3982]] by the [[G3588]] pilot [[G2942]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] owner of the ship. [[G3490]]

###### 12
Since [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] harbor [[G3040]] was [[G5225]] unsuitable [[G428]] to [[G4314]] winter in, [[G3915]] the [[G3588]] majority [[G4119]] decided [[G1012]] to sail [[G321]] on, [[G1564]] if [[G1487]] somehow [[G4459]] they could [[G1410]] reach [[G2658]] Phoenix [[G5405]] to winter [there]. [[G3914]] [Phoenix was] a harbor [[G3040]] in Crete [[G2914]] facing [[G991]] [both] [[G2596]] southwest [[G3047]] and [[G2532]] northwest. [[G5566]]

###### 13
[When] [[G1161]] a {gentle} south wind [[G3558]] began to blow, [[G5285]] they thought [[G1380]] they had [[G2902]] [their] [[G3588]] opportunity. [[G4286]] [So] they weighed [anchor] [[G142]] [and] sailed along, [[G3881]] hugging {the coast} [[G788]] of Crete. [[G2914]]

###### 14
But [[G1161]] [it was] not [[G3756]] long [[G4183]] [before] [[G3326]] a cyclone [[G5189]] called [[G2564]] the Northeaster [[G2148]] swept [[G906]] down across [[G2596]] [the island]. [[G846]]

###### 15
Unable [[G1410]] to head into [[G503]] the [[G3588]] wind, [[G417]] the [[G3588]] ship [[G4143]] was caught up. [[G4884]] [So] we gave way [[G1929]] [and] let ourselves be driven along. [[G5342]]

###### 16
Passing to the lee [[G5295]] of a small [[G5100]] island [[G3519]] called [[G2564]] Cauda, [[G2802]] we barely managed [[G2480]] to secure [[G1096]] the [[G3588]] lifeboat. [[G4627]]

###### 17
After hoisting it up, [[G142]] [the crew] used [[G5530]] ropes [[G996]] to undergird [[G5269]] the [[G3588]] ship. [[G4143]] Fearing [[G5399]] they would run aground [[G1601]] on [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] sandbars of Syrtis, [[G4950]] they lowered [[G5465]] the [[G3588]] sea anchor [[G4632]] [and] [[G3779]] were driven along. [[G5342]]

###### 18
We [[G1473]] were tossed so [[G5492]] violently [[G4971]] [that] the [[G3588]] next [day] [[G1836]] [the men] began [[G4160]] to jettison the cargo. [[G1546]]

###### 19
On the [[G3588]] third [day], [[G5154]] they threw [[G4496]] the [[G3588]] ship’s [[G4143]] tackle {overboard} [[G4631]] with [their] own hands. [[G849]]

###### 20
[When] [[G1161]] neither [[G3383]] sun [[G2246]] nor [[G3383]] stars [[G798]] appeared [[G2014]] for [[G1909]] many [[G4119]] days [[G2250]] and [[G5037]] [the great] [[G3641]] storm [[G5494]] continued to batter us, [[G1945]] we abandoned [[G4014]] all [[G3956]] hope [[G1680]] of [[G1473]] being saved. [[G4982]]

###### 21
[After] [[G5037]] [the men] had gone [[G5225]] a long [[G4183]] time without food, [[G776]] Paul [[G3972]] stood up [[G2476]] among them [[G1722]] [and] said, [[G2036]] “Men, [[G435]] you should have [[G1163]] followed my advice [[G3980]] not [[G3361]] to sail [[G321]] from [[G575]] Crete. [[G2914]] Then [[G5037]] [you would have averted] [[G2770]] this [[G3778]] disaster [[G5196]] and [[G2532]] loss. [[G2209]]

###### 22
[But] [[G2532]] now [[G3568]] I urge [[G3867]] you [[G4771]] to keep up your courage, [[G2114]] because [[G1063]] you [[G4771]] will not experience [[G1510]] [any] loss [[G580]] of life, [[G5590]] but only [[G4133]] of the [[G3588]] ship. [[G4143]]

###### 23
[Just last] [[G3778]] night [[G3571]] an angel [[G32]] of God, [[G2316]] whose [[G3739]] I [[G1473]] am [[G1510]] and [[G2532]] whom [[G3739]] I serve, [[G3000]] stood beside [[G3936]] me [[G1473]]

###### 24
[and] said, [[G3004]] ‘{Do} not [[G3361]] be afraid, [[G5399]] Paul; [[G3972]] you [[G4771]] must [[G1163]] stand before [[G3936]] Caesar. [[G2541]] And [[G2532]] look, [[G2400]] God [[G2316]] has granted [[G5483]] you [[G4771]] [the lives of] all [[G3956]] who [[G3588]] sail [[G4126]] with [[G3326]] you.’ [[G4771]]

###### 25
So [[G1352]] take courage, [[G2114]] men, [[G435]] for [[G1063]] I believe [[G4100]] God [[G2316]] that [[G3754]] it will happen [[G1510]] just [[G3779]] as [[G5158]] He told [[G2980]] me. [[G1473]]

###### 26
However, [[G1161]] we [[G1473]] must [[G1163]] run aground [[G1601]] on [[G1519]] some [[G5100]] island.” [[G3520]]

###### 27
[On] [[G5613]] the fourteenth [[G5065]] night [[G3571]] we [[G1473]] were still being driven [[G1308]] across [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] Adriatic Sea. [[G99]] About [[G2596]] midnight [[G3319]] the [[G3588]] sailors [[G3492]] sensed [[G5282]] they [[G846]] were approaching [[G4317]] land. [[G5561]]

###### 28
They took soundings [[G1001]] [and] found that [the water] [[G2147]] [was] twenty [[G1501]] fathoms [deep]. [[G3712]] Going [[G1339]] a little farther, [[G1024]] they took another set of soundings [[G1001]] that read [[G2147]] fifteen [[G1178]] fathoms. [[G3712]]

###### 29
Fearing that [[G5399]] we would run aground [[G1601]] on [[G2596]] [the] rocks, [[G5138]] they dropped [[G4496]] four [[G5064]] anchors [[G45]] from [[G1537]] [the] stern [[G4403]] [and] prayed for [[G2172]] daybreak. [[G2250]]

###### 30
Meanwhile, [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] sailors [[G3492]] attempted [[G2212]] to escape [[G5343]] from [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] ship. [[G4143]] Pretending [[G4392]] to lower [[G1614]] anchors [[G45]] from [[G1537]] [the] bow, [[G4408]] they let [[G5465]] the [[G3588]] lifeboat [[G4627]] {down} into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] sea. [[G2281]]

###### 31
[But] Paul [[G3972]] said [[G2036]] to the [[G3588]] centurion [[G1543]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] soldiers, [[G4757]] “Unless [[G1437]] these [men] [[G3778]] remain [[G3306]] with [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] ship, [[G4143]] you [[G4771]] cannot [[G1410]] be saved.” [[G4982]]

###### 32
[So] [[G5119]] the [[G3588]] soldiers [[G4757]] cut [[G609]] the [[G3588]] ropes [[G4979]] to the [[G3588]] lifeboat [[G4627]] and [[G2532]] set [[G1439]] it [[G846]] adrift. [[G1601]]

###### 33
Right [[G1161]] up to [[G891]] daybreak, [[G2250]] Paul [[G3972]] kept urging [[G3870]] them all [[G537]] to eat: [[G3335]] “Today [[G4594]] [is your] fourteenth [[G5065]] day [[G2250]] in constant suspense, [[G4328]] without taking any food. [[G4355]]

###### 34
So [[G1352]] for [[G4314]] your [[G5212]] [own] [[G3588]] preservation, [[G4991]] I urge [[G3870]] you [[G4771]] to eat something, [[G3335]] because [[G1063]] not a single [[G3762]] hair [[G2359]] of [[G575]] your [[G4771]] head [[G2776]] will be lost.” [[G622]]

###### 35
[After] [[G1161]] he had said [[G2036]] this, [[G3778]] [Paul] took [[G2983]] bread [[G740]] [and] gave thanks [[G2168]] to God [[G2316]] in front of [[G1799]] them all. [[G3956]] Then [[G2532]] he broke [it] [[G2806]] [and] began [[G756]] to eat. [[G2068]]

###### 36
They were [[G1096]] all [[G3956]] encouraged [[G2115]] and [[G2532]] took [[G4355]] [some] food [[G5160]] themselves. [[G846]]

###### 37
Altogether [[G3956]] there were [[G1510]] 276 {} [[G1250]] of us [[G5590]] on [[G1722]] [board]. [[G4143]]

###### 38
[After] [[G1161]] [the men] had eaten their fill, [[G2880]] they lightened [[G2893]] the [[G3588]] ship [[G4143]] by throwing [[G1544]] the [[G3588]] grain [[G4621]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] sea. [[G2281]]

###### 39
When [[G3753]] daylight [[G2250]] came, [[G1096]] they did not recognize [[G1921]] the [[G3588]] land, [[G1093]] but [[G1161]] they sighted [[G2657]] a [[G5100]] bay [[G2859]] with [[G2192]] a sandy beach, [[G123]] where [[G3739]] they decided [[G1011]] to run [[G1856]] the [[G3588]] ship {aground} [[G4143]] if [[G1487]] they could. [[G1410]]

###### 40
Cutting away [[G4014]] the [[G3588]] anchors, [[G45]] they left [them] [[G1439]] in [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] sea [[G2281]] as [[G260]] they loosened [[G447]] the [[G3588]] ropes [[G2202]] [that held] the [[G3588]] rudders. [[G4079]] Then [[G2532]] they hoisted [[G1869]] the [[G3588]] foresail [[G736]] to the [[G3588]] [wind] [[G4154]] [and] made [[G2722]] for [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] beach. [[G123]]

###### 41
But [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] vessel [[G3491]] struck [[G4045]] a sandbar [[G5117]] [and] ran aground. [[G2027]] The [[G3588]] bow [[G4408]] stuck fast [[G2043]] [and] would not move, [[G761]] and [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] stern [[G4403]] was being tattered [[G3089]] by [[G5259]] the [[G3588]] pounding [[G970]] of the [[G3588]] waves. [[G2949]]

###### 42
The [[G3588]] soldiers [[G4757]] planned [[G1012]] to [[G2443]] kill [[G615]] the [[G3588]] prisoners [[G1202]] so none [[G3361]] of them [[G5100]] could swim [[G1579]] to freedom. [[G1309]]

###### 43
But [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] centurion, [[G1543]] wanting [[G1014]] to spare [[G1295]] Paul’s [ life ], [[G3972]] thwarted [[G2967]] their [[G846]] plan. [[G1013]] He commanded [[G2753]] those [[G3588]] who could [[G1410]] swim [[G2860]] to jump overboard [[G641]] first [[G4413]] [and] get [[G1826]] to [[G1909]] land. [[G1093]]

###### 44
The [[G3588]] rest [were to follow] [[G3062]] on [[G1909]] planks [[G4548]] and [[G1161]] various parts [[G5100]] of [[G575]] the [[G3588]] ship. [[G4143]] In this way [[G3779]] everyone [[G3956]] was brought safely [[G1295]] to [[G1909]] land. [[G1093]]
