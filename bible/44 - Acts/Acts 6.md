###### 1
In [[G1722]] those [[G3778]] days [when] [[G2250]] the [[G3588]] disciples [[G3101]] were increasing in number, [[G4129]] the [[G3588]] Grecian [Jews] [[G1675]] began [[G1096]] to grumble [[G1112]] against [[G4314]] the [[G3588]] Hebraic [Jews], [[G1445]] because [[G3754]] their [[G846]] widows [[G5503]] were being overlooked [[G3865]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] daily [[G2522]] distribution [ of food ]. [[G1248]]

###### 2
So [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] Twelve [[G1427]] summoned [[G4341]] all [[G4128]] the [[G3588]] disciples [[G3101]] [and] said, [[G2036]] “It is [[G1510]] unacceptable [[G701]] [for] us [[G1473]] to neglect [[G2641]] the [[G3588]] word [[G3056]] of God [[G2316]] [in order] to wait on [[G1247]] tables. [[G5132]]

###### 3
Therefore, [[G1161]] brothers, [[G80]] select [[G1980]] from [[G1537]] among you [[G4771]] seven [[G2033]] men [[G435]] confirmed to be [[G3140]] full [[G4134]] of [the] Spirit [[G4151]] and [[G2532]] wisdom. [[G4678]] We will appoint [[G2525]] this [[G3778]] responsibility [[G5532]] [to them] [[G3739]]

###### 4
and [[G1161]] devote ourselves [[G4342]] to [[G3588]] prayer [[G4335]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] ministry [[G1248]] of the [[G3588]] word.” [[G3056]]

###### 5
[This] [[G3588]] proposal [[G3056]] pleased [[G700]] the [[G3588]] whole [[G3956]] group. [[G4128]] They chose [[G1586]] Stephen, [[G4736]] a man [[G435]] full [[G4134]] of faith [[G4102]] and [[G2532]] [of the] Holy [[G40]] Spirit, [[G4151]] as well as [[G2532]] Philip, [[G5376]] Prochorus, [[G4402]] Nicanor, [[G3527]] Timon, [[G5096]] Parmenas, [[G3937]] and [[G2532]] Nicolas [[G3532]] from Antioch, [[G491]] a convert to Judaism. [[G4339]]

###### 6
They presented [[G2476]] [these seven] [[G3739]] to [[G1799]] the [[G3588]] apostles, [[G652]] [who] [[G2532]] prayed [[G4336]] [and] laid [[G2007]] [their] [[G3588]] hands [[G5495]] on them. [[G846]]

###### 7
[So] [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] word [[G3056]] of God [[G2316]] continued to spread. [[G837]] The [[G3588]] number [[G706]] of [[G3588]] disciples [[G3101]] in [[G1722]] Jerusalem [[G2419]] grew [[G4129]] rapidly, [[G4970]] and [[G5037]] a great [[G4183]] number [[G3793]] of [[G3588]] priests [[G2409]] became obedient [[G5219]] to the [[G3588]] faith. [[G4102]]

###### 8
Now [[G1161]] Stephen, [[G4736]] full [[G4134]] of grace [[G5485]] and [[G2532]] power, [[G1411]] was performing [[G4160]] great [[G3173]] wonders [[G5059]] and [[G2532]] signs [[G4592]] among [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] people. [[G2992]]

###### 9
But [[G1161]] resistance arose [[G450]] from [[G1537]] what [[G3588]] was known as [[G3004]] [the] Synagogue [[G4864]] of the [[G3588]] Freedmen, [[G3032]] including [[G2532]] Cyrenians, [[G2956]] Alexandrians, [[G221]] and [[G2532]] men [[G3588]] from [[G575]] [the provinces of] Cilicia [[G2791]] and [[G2532]] Asia. [[G773]] They began to argue [[G4802]] with [[G3588]] Stephen, [[G4736]]

###### 10
[but] [[G2532]] they could not [[G2480]] stand up to [[G436]] [his] [[G3588]] wisdom [[G4678]] [or] [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] Spirit [[G4151]] by whom [[G3739]] he spoke. [[G2980]]

###### 11
Then [[G5119]] they prompted [[G5260]] [some] men [[G435]] to say, [[G3004]] “We heard [[G191]] [Stephen] [[G846]] speak [[G2980]] words [[G4487]] of blasphemy [[G989]] against [[G1519]] Moses [[G3475]] and [[G2532]] [against] God.” [[G2316]]

###### 12
[So] [[G5037]] they stirred up [[G4787]] the [[G3588]] people [[G2992]] and [[G2532]] elders [[G4245]] and [[G2532]] scribes. [[G1122]] They seized [[G4884]] [Stephen] [[G846]] and [[G2532]] brought [him] [[G71]] before [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] Sanhedrin. [[G4892]]

###### 13
They presented [[G2476]] FALSE [[G5571]] witnesses [[G3144]] [who] said, [[G3004]] “This [[G3778]] man [[G444]] never stops [[G3973]] speaking [[G2980]] against [[G2596]] this [[G3778]] holy [[G40]] place [[G5117]] and [[G2532]] [against] the [[G3588]] Law. [[G3551]]

###### 14
For [[G1063]] we have heard [[G191]] him [[G846]] say [[G3004]] that [[G3754]] Jesus [[G2424]] of [[G3588]] Nazareth [[G3480]] will destroy [[G2647]] this [[G3778]] place [[G5117]] and [[G2532]] change [[G236]] the [[G3588]] customs [[G1485]] that [[G3739]] Moses [[G3475]] handed down [[G3860]] to us.” [[G1473]]

###### 15
All [[G3956]] who [[G3588]] were sitting [[G2516]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] Sanhedrin [[G4892]] looked intently [[G816]] at [[G1519]] [Stephen], [[G846]] [and] they saw that [[G3708]] his [[G846]] face [[G4383]] [was] like [[G5616]] [the] face [[G4383]] of an angel. [[G32]]
