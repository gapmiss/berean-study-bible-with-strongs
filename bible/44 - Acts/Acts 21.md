###### 1
After [[G5613]] we had torn ourselves away [[G645]] from [[G575]] them, [[G846]] we [[G1473]] sailed [[G321]] directly [[G2113]] to [[G1519]] Cos, [[G2972]] and [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] next [day] [[G1836]] on to [[G1519]] Rhodes, [[G4499]] and from there [[G2547]] to [[G1519]] Patara. [[G3959]]

###### 2
Finding [[G2147]] a ship [[G4143]] crossing over [[G1276]] to [[G1519]] Phoenicia, [[G5403]] we boarded [it] [[G1910]] [and] set sail. [[G321]]

###### 3
[After] [[G1161]] sighting [[G398]] Cyprus [[G2954]] and [[G2532]] passing south of it, [[G2641]] we sailed on [[G4126]] to [[G1519]] Syria [[G4947]] and [[G2532]] landed [[G2718]] at [[G1519]] Tyre, [[G5184]] [where] [[G1566]] the [[G3588]] ship [[G4143]] was [[G1510]] to unload [[G670]] [its] [[G3588]] cargo. [[G1117]]

###### 4
We sought out [[G429]] the [[G3588]] disciples [[G3101]] [in Tyre] [[G847]] [and] stayed [with them] [[G1961]] seven [[G2033]] days. [[G2250]] Through [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] Spirit [[G4151]] [they] [[G3748]] kept telling [[G2036]] Paul [[G3972]] not [[G3361]] to go up [[G1910]] to [[G1519]] Jerusalem. [[G2414]]

###### 5
But [[G1161]] when [[G3753]] our [[G1473]] time [there] [[G2250]] had ended, [[G1822]] we set out [[G1831]] on our journey. [[G4198]] All [the disciples], [[G3956]] with [[G4862]] [their] wives [[G1135]] and [[G2532]] children, [[G5043]] accompanied [[G4311]] us [[G1473]] out of [[G1854]] the [[G3588]] city [[G4172]] and [[G2532]] knelt down [[G5087]] on [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] beach [[G123]] to pray [with us]. [[G4336]]

###### 6
After we had said our farewells, [[G782]] we went aboard [[G305]] the [[G3588]] ship, [[G4143]] and [[G1161]] they [[G1565]] returned [[G5290]] home. [[G2398]]

###### 7
[When] [[G1161]] we had finished [[G1274]] [our] [[G3588]] voyage [[G4144]] from [[G575]] Tyre, [[G5184]] we [[G1473]] landed [[G2658]] at [[G1519]] Ptolemais, [[G4424]] [where] [[G2532]] we greeted [[G782]] the [[G3588]] brothers [[G80]] [and] stayed [[G3306]] with [[G3844]] them [[G846]] for a [[G1520]] day. [[G2250]]

###### 8
Leaving [[G1831]] the [[G3588]] next day, [[G1887]] we reached [[G2064]] Caesarea, [[G2542]] and [[G2532]] we went [[G1525]] to stay [[G3306]] at [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] home [[G3624]] of Philip [[G5376]] the [[G3588]] evangelist, [[G2099]] who was [[G1510]] [one] of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] Seven. [[G2033]]

###### 9
[He] [[G3778]] had [[G1510]] four [[G5064]] unmarried [[G3933]] daughters [[G2364]] who prophesied. [[G4395]]

###### 10
After [[G1161]] we had been there [[G1961]] several [[G4119]] days, [[G2250]] a [[G5100]] prophet [[G4396]] named [[G3686]] Agabus [[G13]] came down [[G2718]] from [[G575]] Judea. [[G2449]]

###### 11
Coming over [[G2064]] to [[G4314]] us, [[G1473]] he took [[G142]] Paul’s [[G3972]] belt, [[G2223]] bound [[G1210]] his [[G1438]] [own] [[G3588]] feet [[G4228]] and [[G2532]] hands, [[G5495]] [and] said, [[G2036]] “The [[G3588]] Holy [[G40]] Spirit [[G4151]] says: [[G3004]] ‘In this way [[G3779]] the [[G3588]] Jews [[G2453]] of [[G1722]] Jerusalem [[G2419]] will bind [[G1210]] the [[G3588]] owner of [[G435]] this [[G3778]] belt [[G2223]] and [[G2532]] hand [him] over [[G3860]] to [the] Gentiles.’ [[G1484]]

###### 12
When [[G5613]] we heard [[G191]] this, [[G3778]] we [[G1473]] and [[G2532]] the [people] [[G3588]] there [[G1786]] pleaded with [[G3870]] [Paul] [[G846]] not [[G3361]] to go up [[G305]] to [[G1519]] Jerusalem. [[G2419]]

###### 13
Then [[G5119]] Paul [[G3972]] answered, [[G611]] “Why [[G5101]] are you [[G4160]] weeping [[G2799]] and [[G2532]] breaking [[G4919]] my [[G1473]] heart? [[G2588]] I [[G1473]] am [[G2192]] ready [[G2093]] not [[G3756]] only [[G3440]] to be bound, [[G1210]] but [[G235]] also [[G2532]] to die [[G599]] in [[G1519]] Jerusalem [[G2419]] for [[G5228]] the [[G3588]] name [[G3686]] of the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] Jesus. [[G2424]]

###### 14
[When] [[G1161]] he [[G846]] would not be dissuaded, [[G3982]] we fell silent [[G2270]] [and] said, [[G2036]] “The [[G3588]] Lord’s [[G2962]] will [[G2307]] be done.” [[G1096]]

###### 15
After [[G3326]] these [[G3778]] days, [[G2250]] we packed up [[G643]] [and] went on [[G305]] to [[G1519]] Jerusalem. [[G2414]]

###### 16
[Some] of the [[G3588]] disciples [[G3101]] from [[G575]] Caesarea [[G2542]] accompanied [[G4905]] us, [[G1473]] [and] they took us [[G71]] to stay at the home [[G3579]] of Mnason [[G3416]] [the] Cypriot, [[G2953]] an early [[G744]] disciple. [[G3101]]

###### 17
When we [[G1473]] arrived [[G1096]] in [[G1519]] Jerusalem, [[G2414]] the [[G3588]] brothers [[G80]] welcomed [[G588]] us [[G1473]] joyfully. [[G780]]

###### 18
The [[G3588]] next [day], [[G1966]] Paul [[G3972]] went in [[G1524]] with [[G4862]] us [[G1473]] to [see] [[G4314]] James, [[G2385]] and [[G5037]] all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] elders [[G4245]] were present. [[G3854]]

###### 19
[Paul] greeted [[G782]] them [[G846]] [and] recounted [[G1834]] one [[G1520]] by [[G2596]] one [[G1538]] the things [[G3739]] God [[G2316]] had done [[G4160]] among [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] Gentiles [[G1484]] through [[G1223]] his [[G846]] ministry. [[G1248]]

###### 20
When they heard [this], [[G191]] they glorified [[G1392]] God. [[G2316]] Then [[G5037]] they said [[G2036]] to [Paul], [[G846]] “You see, [[G2334]] brother, [[G80]] how many [[G4214]] thousands [[G3461]] of [[G1722]] Jews [[G2453]] have believed, [[G4100]] and [[G2532]] all [[G3956]] of them are [[G5225]] zealous [[G2207]] for the [[G3588]] Law. [[G3551]]

###### 21
But [[G1161]] they are under the impression [[G2727]] that [[G3754]] you [[G4771]] teach [[G1321]] all [[G3956]] [the] Jews [[G2453]] who [live] [[G3588]] among [[G2596]] the [[G3588]] Gentiles [[G1484]] to forsake [[G646]] Moses, [[G3475]] telling [[G3004]] them [[G846]] not [[G3361]] to circumcise [[G4059]] [their] [[G3588]] children [[G5043]] [or] [[G3366]] observe [[G4043]] [our] customs. [[G1485]]

###### 22
What [[G5101]] then [[G3767]] should [we do]? [[G1510]] They will certainly hear [[G191]] that [[G3754]] you have come. [[G2064]]

###### 23
Therefore [[G3767]] do [[G4160]] what [[G3739]] we advise [[G3004]] you. [[G4771]] There are [[G1510]] four [[G5064]] men [[G435]] with us [[G1473]] who have taken [[G2192]] a vow. [[G2171]]

###### 24
Take [[G3880]] these [men], [[G3778]] purify yourself [[G48]] along with [[G4862]] them, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] pay their expenses [[G1159]] so [[G2443]] {they can have} [their] [[G3588]] heads [[G2776]] shaved. [[G3587]] Then [[G2532]] everyone [[G3956]] will know [[G1097]] that [[G3754]] there [[G1510]] is no truth [[G3762]] [to these] [[G3739]] rumors [[G2727]] about [[G4012]] you, [[G4771]] but [that] [[G235]] you [[G846]] also [[G2532]] live [[G4748]] in obedience [[G5442]] to the [[G3588]] Law. [[G3551]]

###### 25
As for [[G4012]] the [[G3588]] Gentile [[G1484]] believers, [[G4100]] we [[G1473]] have written [them] [[G1989]] our decision [[G2919]] [that] they [[G846]] must abstain [[G5442]] from [food] [[G3588]] sacrificed to idols, [[G1494]] [from] [[G2532]] blood, [[G129]] [from] [[G2532]] the meat of strangled animals, [[G4156]] and [from] [[G2532]] sexual immorality.” [[G4202]]

###### 26
[So] [[G5119]] the [[G3588]] next [[G2192]] day [[G2250]] Paul [[G3972]] took [[G3880]] the [[G3588]] men [[G435]] [and] purified himself [[G48]] along with [[G4862]] them. [[G846]] [Then] he entered [[G1524]] the [[G3588]] temple [[G2411]] to give notice [[G1229]] of the [[G3588]] date [[G2250]] [their] [[G3588]] purification [[G49]] would be complete [[G1604]] [and] [[G2193]] the [[G3588]] offering [[G4376]] would be made [[G4374]] for [[G5228]] each [[G1538]] of them. [[G846]]

###### 27
When [[G5613]] the [[G3588]] seven [[G2033]] days [[G2250]] were almost [[G3195]] over, [[G4931]] [some] [[G3588]] Jews [[G2453]] from [[G575]] [the province of] Asia [[G773]] saw [[G2300]] [Paul] [[G846]] at [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] temple. [[G2411]] They stirred up [[G4797]] the [[G3588]] whole [[G3956]] crowd [[G3793]] and [[G2532]] seized [[G1911]] him, [[G846]]

###### 28
crying out, [[G2896]] “Men [[G435]] [of] Israel, [[G2475]] help us! [[G997]] This [[G3778]] is [[G1510]] the [[G3588]] man [[G444]] who [[G3588]] teaches [[G1321]] all [men] [[G3956]] everywhere [[G3837]] against [[G2596]] [our] [[G3588]] people [[G2992]] and [[G2532]] [against our] [[G3588]] Law [[G3551]] and [[G2532]] [against] this [[G3778]] place. [[G5117]] Furthermore, [[G5037]] he has brought [[G1521]] Greeks [[G1672]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] temple [[G2411]] and [[G2532]] defiled [[G2840]] this [[G3778]] holy [[G40]] place. [[G5117]]

###### 29
For [[G1063]] they had [[G1510]] previously seen [[G4308]] Trophimus [[G5161]] the [[G3588]] Ephesian [[G2180]] with [[G4862]] him [[G846]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] city, [[G4172]] [and] they assumed [[G3543]] that [[G3754]] Paul [[G3972]] had brought [[G1521]] [him] [[G3739]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] temple. [[G2411]]

###### 30
The [[G3588]] whole [[G3650]] city [[G4172]] was stirred up, [[G2795]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] people [[G2992]] rushed together. [[G4890]] They seized [[G1949]] Paul [[G3972]] [and] dragged [[G1670]] him [[G846]] out of [[G1854]] the [[G3588]] temple, [[G2411]] and [[G2532]] at once [[G2112]] the [[G3588]] gates [[G2374]] were shut. [[G2808]]

###### 31
[While] [[G5037]] they were trying [[G2212]] to kill [[G615]] him, [[G846]] the [[G3588]] commander [[G5506]] of the [[G3588]] [Roman] regiment [[G4686]] received [[G305]] a report [[G5334]] that [[G3754]] all [[G3650]] Jerusalem [[G2419]] was in turmoil. [[G4797]]

###### 32
Immediately [[G1824]] he took [[G3880]] [some] soldiers [[G4757]] and [[G2532]] centurions [[G1543]] [and] ran down [[G2701]] to [[G1909]] [the crowd]. [[G846]] [When the people] saw [[G3708]] the [[G3588]] commander [[G5506]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] soldiers, [[G4757]] they stopped [[G3973]] beating [[G5180]] Paul. [[G3972]]

###### 33
The [[G3588]] commander [[G5506]] came up [[G1448]] [and] arrested [[G1949]] [Paul], [[G846]] ordering that [[G2753]] he be bound [[G1210]] with two [[G1417]] chains. [[G254]] Then [[G2532]] he asked [[G4441]] who [[G5101]] he was [[G1510]] and [[G2532]] what [[G5101]] he had done. [[G4160]]

###### 34
[Some] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] crowd [[G3793]] were shouting [[G2019]] one thing, [[G5100]] [and] [[G1161]] [some] [[G243]] another. [[G243]] And [since] [[G1161]] [the commander] [[G846]] could not [[G1410]] determine [[G1097]] the [[G3588]] facts [[G804]] because of [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] uproar, [[G2351]] he ordered that [[G2753]] [Paul] [[G846]] be brought [[G71]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] barracks. [[G3925]]

###### 35
When [[G3753]] [Paul] reached [[G1096]] the [[G3588]] steps, [[G304]] he [[G846]] had to be carried [[G941]] by [[G5259]] the [[G3588]] soldiers [[G4757]] because of [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] violence [[G970]] of the [[G3588]] mob. [[G3793]]

###### 36
For [[G1063]] the [[G3588]] crowd [[G4128]] that followed [him] [[G190]] kept shouting, [[G2896]] “Away with [[G142]] him!” [[G846]]

###### 37
[As] [[G5037]] they were about [[G3195]] to take [[G1521]] Paul [[G3972]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] barracks, [[G3925]] he asked [[G3004]] the [[G3588]] commander, [[G5506]] “May [[G1832]] I [[G1473]] say [[G2036]] something [[G5100]] to [[G4314]] you?” [[G4771]] “Do you speak [[G1097]] Greek?” [[G1676]] [he] [[G3588]] replied. [[G5346]]

###### 38
“Aren’t [[G1510]] you [[G4771]] the [[G3588]] Egyptian [[G124]] who [[G3588]] incited a rebellion [[G387]] some time ago [[G4253]] and [[G2532]] led [[G1806]] four thousand [[G5070]] members [[G435]] of the [[G3588]] ‘Assassins’ [[G4607]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] wilderness?” [[G2048]]

###### 39
But [[G1161]] Paul [[G3972]] answered, [[G2036]] “I [[G1473]] am [[G1510]] a Jew [[G2453]] from Tarsus [[G5018]] in Cilicia, [[G2791]] a citizen [of] [[G4177]] no [[G3756]] ordinary [[G767]] city. [[G4172]] Now [[G1161]] I beg [[G1189]] you [[G4771]] to allow [[G2010]] me [[G1473]] to speak [[G2980]] to [[G4314]] the [[G3588]] people. [[G2992]]

###### 40
Having received permission, [[G2010]] Paul [[G3972]] stood [[G2476]] on [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] steps [[G304]] [and] motioned [[G2678]] to the [[G3588]] crowd. [[G2992]] A great [[G4183]] hush [[G4602]] came over [the crowd], [[G1096]] [and] he addressed [them] [[G4377]] in [[G3588]] Aramaic: [[G1446]]
