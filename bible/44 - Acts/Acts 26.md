### 1
Agrippa [[G67]] said [[G5346]] to [[G4314]] Paul, [[G3972]] “You [[G4771]] have permission [[G2010]] to speak [[G3004]] for [[G5228]] yourself.” [[G4572]] Then [[G5119]] Paul [[G3972]] stretched out [[G1614]] [his] [[G3588]] hand [[G5495]] [and] began his defense: [[G626]]

### 2
“King [[G935]] Agrippa, [[G67]] I consider [[G2233]] myself [[G1683]] fortunate [[G3107]] to stand [[G3195]] before [[G1909]] you [[G4771]] today [[G4594]] to defend myself [[G626]] against [[G4012]] all [[G3956]] the accusations [[G1458]] of [[G5259]] [the] Jews, [[G2453]]

### 3
especially [[G3122]] [since] you [[G4771]] are [[G1510]] acquainted [[G1109]] with all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] Jewish [[G2453]] customs [[G1485]] and [[G5037]] controversies. [[G2213]] I beg [you], [[G1189]] therefore, [[G1352]] to listen to [[G191]] me [[G1473]] patiently. [[G3116]]

### 4
Surely [[G3767]] all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] Jews [[G2453]] know [[G1492]] how I have lived [[G981]] from [[G575]] [the] earliest days [[G746]] of [[G1537]] [my] youth, [[G3503]] among [[G1722]] my own [[G1473]] people [[G1484]] and [[G5037]] in [[G1722]] Jerusalem. [[G2414]]

### 5
They have known [[G4267]] me [[G1473]] for a long time [[G509]] [and] can testify, [[G3140]] if [[G1437]] they are willing, [[G2309]] that [[G3754]] I lived as [[G2198]] a Pharisee, [[G5330]] adhering to [[G2596]] the [[G3588]] strictest [[G196]] sect [[G139]] of our [[G2251]] religion. [[G2356]]

### 6
And [[G2532]] now [[G3568]] I stand [[G2476]] on trial [[G2919]] because of [[G1909]] [my] hope [[G1680]] in the [[G3588]] promise [that] [[G1860]] God [[G2316]] made [[G1096]] to [[G1519]] our [[G1473]] fathers, [[G3962]]

### 7
[ the promise ] [[G1519]] our [[G1473]] twelve tribes [[G1429]] are hoping [[G1679]] to realize [[G2658]] as they earnestly serve [ God ] [[G3000]] day [[G2250]] and [[G2532]] night. [[G3571]] [It is] because of [[G4012]] [this] [[G3739]] hope, [[G1680]] O king, [[G935]] [that] I am accused [[G1458]] by [[G5259]] the Jews. [[G2453]]

### 8
Why {would} [[G5101]] any of you [[G4771]] consider it [[G2919]] incredible [[G571]] that [[G1487]] God [[G2316]] raises [[G1453]] [the] dead? [[G3498]]

### 9
So then, [[G3767]] I [[G1473]] [too] [[G1683]] was convinced that [[G1380]] I ought [[G1163]] to do [[G4238]] all [I could] [[G4183]] to oppose [[G1727]] the [[G3588]] name [[G3686]] of Jesus [[G2424]] of Nazareth. [[G3480]]

### 10
And [[G2532]] [that] is what [[G3739]] I did [[G4160]] in [[G1722]] Jerusalem. [[G2414]] With [[G2983]] authority [[G1849]] from [[G3844]] the [[G3588]] chief priests [[G749]] I [[G1473]] put [[G2623]] many [[G4183]] of the [[G3588]] saints [[G40]] in [[G1722]] prison, [[G5438]] and [[G5037]] [when] they [[G846]] were condemned to death, [[G337]] I cast my vote against [them]. [[G2702]]

### 11
I frequently had them punished [[G5097]] in [[G2596]] the [[G3588]] synagogues [[G4864]] [and] tried to make [them] [[G315]] blaspheme. [[G987]] In my raging fury [[G1693]] against them, [[G846]] {I} even [[G2532]] [went] [[G2193]] to [[G1519]] foreign [[G1854]] cities [[G4172]] to persecute [them]. [[G1377]]

### 12
In [[G1722]] this [pursuit], [[G3739]] I was on my way [[G4198]] to [[G1519]] Damascus [[G1154]] with [[G3326]] [the] authority [[G1849]] and [[G2532]] commission [[G2011]] of [[G3588]] the [[G3588]] chief priests. [[G749]]

### 13
About noon, [[G3319]] O king, [[G935]] [as I was] on [[G2596]] the [[G3588]] road, [[G3598]] I saw [[G3708]] a light [[G5457]] from heaven, [[G3771]] brighter than [[G2987]] the [[G3588]] sun, [[G2246]] shining around [[G4034]] me [[G1473]] and [[G2532]] my companions. [[G3588]]

### 14
We [[G1473]] all [[G3956]] fell [[G2667]] to [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] ground, [[G1093]] [and] I heard [[G191]] a voice [[G5456]] say [[G3004]] to [[G4314]] me [[G1473]] in [[G3588]] Aramaic, [[G1446]] ‘Saul, [[G4549]] Saul, [[G4549]] why [[G5101]] do you persecute [[G1377]] Me? [[G1473]] [It is] hard [[G4642]] for you [[G4771]] to kick [[G2979]] against [[G4314]] [the] goads. [[G2759]]

### 15
‘Who [[G5101]] are You, [[G1510]] Lord?’ [[G2962]] I [[G1473]] asked. [[G2036]] ‘I [[G1473]] am [[G1510]] Jesus, [[G2424]] whom [[G3739]] you [[G4771]] are persecuting,’ [[G1377]] the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] replied. [[G2036]]

### 16
‘But [[G235]] get up [[G450]] and [[G2532]] stand [[G2476]] on [[G1909]] your [[G4771]] feet. [[G4228]] For [[G1063]] I have appeared [[G3708]] to you [[G4771]] to [[G1519]] appoint [[G4400]] you [[G4771]] as a servant [[G5257]] and [[G2532]] as a witness [[G3144]] of what [[G3739]] you have seen [[G3708]] from Me [[G1473]] and [[G5037]] what [[G3739]] I will show [[G3708]] you. [[G4771]]

### 17
I will rescue [[G1807]] you [[G4771]] from [[G1537]] [your own] [[G3588]] people [[G2992]] and [[G2532]] from [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] Gentiles. [[G1484]] I [[G1473]] am sending [[G649]] you [[G4771]] to [[G1519]] [them] [[G3739]]

### 18
to open [[G455]] their [[G846]] eyes, [[G3788]] so that [[G3588]] they may turn [[G1994]] from [[G575]] darkness [[G4655]] to [[G1519]] light [[G5457]] and [[G2532]] from the [[G3588]] power [[G1849]] of Satan [[G4567]] to [[G1909]] God, [[G2316]] [that] [[G3588]] they [[G846]] may receive [[G2983]] forgiveness [[G859]] of sins [[G266]] and [[G2532]] [an] inheritance [[G2819]] among [[G1722]] those [[G3588]] sanctified [[G37]] by faith [[G4102]] in [[G1519]] Me. [[G1473]]

### 19
So then, [[G3606]] King [[G935]] Agrippa, [[G67]] I was [[G1096]] not [[G3756]] disobedient [[G545]] to the [[G3588]] heavenly [[G3770]] vision. [[G3701]]

### 20
First [[G4412]] to those [[G3588]] in [[G1722]] Damascus [[G1154]] and [[G2532]] Jerusalem, [[G2414]] then [[G5037]] to everyone [[G3956]] in the [[G3588]] region [[G5561]] of Judea, [[G2449]] and then [[G2532]] to the [[G3588]] Gentiles, [[G1484]] I declared that [[G518]] they should repent [[G3340]] and [[G2532]] turn [[G1994]] to [[G1909]] God, [[G2316]] performing [[G4238]] deeds [[G2041]] worthy [[G514]] [of their] [[G3588]] repentance. [[G3341]]

### 21
For this reason [[G1752]] the Jews [[G2453]] seized [[G4815]] me [[G1473]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] temple courts [[G2411]] [and] tried [[G3987]] to kill [me]. [[G1315]]

### 22
[But] [[G3767]] I have had [[G5177]] God’s [[G2316]] help [[G1947]] to [[G891]] this [[G3778]] day, [[G2250]] [and] I stand [here] [[G2476]] to testify [[G3143]] to small [[G3398]] and [[G2532]] great [[G3173]] alike. [[G5037]] I am saying [[G3004]] nothing [[G3762]] beyond [[G1622]] what [[G3739]] the [[G3588]] prophets [[G4396]] and [[G2532]] Moses [[G3475]] said [[G2980]] would [[G3195]] happen: [[G1096]]

### 23
that [[G1487]] Christ [[G5547]] would suffer, [[G3805]] [and as the] [[G1487]] first [[G4413]] to rise [[G386]] from [[G1537]] [the] dead, [[G3498]] He would [[G3195]] proclaim [[G2605]] light [[G5457]] to [[G3588]] our people [[G2992]] and [[G2532]] to the [[G3588]] Gentiles.” [[G1484]]

### 24
At this stage [[G3778]] of [Paul’s] [[G846]] defense, [[G626]] Festus [[G5347]] exclaimed [[G5346]] in a loud [[G3173]] voice, [[G5456]] “You are insane, [[G3105]] Paul! [[G3972]] [Your] [[G3588]] great [[G4183]] learning [[G1121]] is driving [[G4062]] you [[G4771]] to [[G1519]] madness!” [[G3130]]

### 25
But [[G1161]] Paul [[G3972]] answered [[G5346]] vvv, [[G3756]] “I am not insane, [[G3105]] most excellent [[G2903]] Festus; [[G5347]] I am speaking [[G669]] words [[G4487]] of truth [[G225]] and [[G2532]] sobriety. [[G4997]]

### 26
For [[G1063]] the [[G3588]] king [[G935]] knows [[G1987]] about [[G4012]] these [matters], [[G3778]] and [[G2532]] I can speak [[G2980]] freely [[G3955]] to [[G4314]] [him]. [[G3739]] I am confident that [[G3982]] none [[G3762]] of this [[G3778]] has escaped [[G2990]] his [notice], [[G846]] because [[G1063]] [it] [[G3778]] was [[G1510]] not [[G3756]] done [[G4238]] in [[G1722]] a corner. [[G1137]]

### 27
King [[G935]] Agrippa, [[G67]] do you believe [[G4100]] the [[G3588]] prophets? [[G4396]] I know [[G1492]] you [do].” [[G4100]]

### 28
Then [[G1161]] Agrippa [[G67]] [said] to [[G4314]] Paul, [[G3972]] “Can you persuade [[G3982]] me [[G1473]] in [[G1722]] such a short [time] [[G3641]] to become [[G4160]] a Christian?” [[G5546]]

### 29
“Short [time] [[G3641]] [or] [[G2532]] long,” [[G3173]] Paul [replied], [[G3972]] “I wish [[G2172]] to God [[G2316]] that [[G302]] not [[G3756]] only [[G3440]] you [[G4771]] but [[G235]] all [[G3956]] who [[G3588]] hear [[G191]] me [[G1473]] this day [[G4594]] may become [[G1096]] what [[G5108]] I [[G1473]] am, [[G1510]] except for [[G3924]] these [[G3778]] chains.” [[G1199]]

### 30
Then [[G5037]] the [[G3588]] king [[G935]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] governor [[G2232]] rose, [[G450]] along with [[G5037]] Bernice [[G959]] and [[G2532]] those [[G3588]] seated with [[G4775]] them. [[G846]]

### 31
On their way out, [[G402]] they said [[G2980]] to [[G4314]] one another, [[G240]] “This [[G3778]] man [[G444]] has done [[G4238]] nothing [[G3762]] worthy [[G514]] of death [[G2288]] or [[G2228]] imprisonment.” [[G1199]]

### 32
And [[G1161]] Agrippa [[G67]] said [[G5346]] to [[G3588]] Festus, [[G5347]] “This [[G3778]] man [[G444]] could [[G1410]] have been released [[G630]] if [[G1487]] he had not appealed [[G1941]] to Caesar.” [[G2541]]
