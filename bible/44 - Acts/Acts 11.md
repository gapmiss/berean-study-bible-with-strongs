### 1
The [[G3588]] apostles [[G652]] and [[G2532]] brothers [[G80]] throughout [[G2596]] Judea [[G2449]] soon [[G1161]] heard [[G191]] that [[G3754]] the [[G3588]] Gentiles [[G1484]] also [[G2532]] had received [[G1209]] the [[G3588]] word [[G3056]] of God. [[G2316]]

### 2
[So] [[G1161]] when [[G3753]] Peter [[G4074]] went up [[G305]] to [[G1519]] Jerusalem, [[G2419]] [the] circumcised [believers] [[G4061]] took issue [[G1252]] with [[G4314]] him [[G846]]

### 3
[and] said, [[G3004]] “You visited [[G1525]] uncircumcised [[G203]] men [[G435]] and [[G2532]] ate with [[G4906]] them.” [[G846]]

### 4
But [[G1161]] Peter [[G4074]] began [[G756]] [and] explained [[G1620]] to them [[G846]] the whole sequence of events: [[G2517]]

### 5
“I [[G1473]] was [[G1510]] in [[G1722]] [the] city [[G4172]] of Joppa [[G2445]] praying, [[G4336]] and [[G2532]] in [[G1722]] a trance [[G1611]] I saw [[G3708]] a vision [[G3705]] [of] something [[G5100]] like [[G5613]] a large [[G3173]] sheet [[G3607]] being let down [[G2524]] from [[G1537]] heaven [[G3772]] by [its] four [[G5064]] corners, [[G746]] and [[G2532]] it came right down to [[G2064]] me. [[G1473]]

### 6
I looked [[G816]] at [[G1519]] it {closely} [[G3739]] [and] saw [[G2657]] four-footed animals [[G5074]] of the [[G3588]] earth, [[G1093]] wild beasts, [[G2342]] reptiles, [[G2062]] and [[G2532]] birds [[G4071]] of the [[G3588]] air. [[G3772]]

### 7
Then [[G1161]] I heard [[G191]] a voice [[G5456]] saying [[G3004]] to me, [[G1473]] ‘Get up, [[G450]] Peter, [[G4074]] kill [[G2380]] and [[G2532]] eat.’ [[G5315]]

### 8
‘No, [[G3365]] Lord,’ [[G2962]] I said, [[G2036]] ‘for [[G3754]] nothing [[G3763]] impure [[G2839]] or [[G2228]] unclean [[G169]] has {ever} entered [[G1525]] my [[G1473]] mouth.’ [[G4750]]

### 9
But [[G1161]] the voice [[G5456]] spoke [[G611]] from [[G1537]] heaven [[G3772]] a second [time], [[G1208]] ‘Do not call anything impure [[G2840]] that [[G3739]] God [[G2316]] has made clean.’ [[G2511]]

### 10
This [[G3778]] happened [[G1096]] three times, [[G5151]] and [[G2532]] everything [[G537]] was drawn back up [[G385]] into [[G1519]] heaven. [[G3772]]

### 11
Just then, [[G2400]] three [[G5140]] men [[G435]] sent [[G649]] to [[G4314]] me [[G1473]] from [[G575]] Caesarea [[G2542]] stopped [[G2186]] at [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] house [[G3614]] [where] [[G3739]] I was [staying]. [[G1510]]

### 12
The [[G3588]] Spirit [[G4151]] told [[G2036]] me [[G1473]] to accompany [[G4905]] them [[G846]] without [[G3367]] hesitation. [[G1252]] These [[G3778]] six [[G1803]] brothers [[G80]] also [[G2532]] went [[G2064]] with [[G4862]] me, [[G1473]] and [[G2532]] we entered [[G1525]] the [[G3588]] man’s [[G435]] home. [[G3624]]

### 13
He told [[G518]] us [[G1473]] how [[G4459]] he had seen [[G3708]] an angel [[G32]] standing [[G2476]] in [[G1722]] his [[G846]] house [[G3624]] and [[G2532]] saying, [[G2036]] ‘Send [[G649]] to [[G1519]] Joppa [[G2445]] [for] [[G3343]] Simon [[G4613]] who [[G3588]] is called [[G1941]] Peter. [[G4074]]

### 14
[He] [[G3739]] will convey [[G2980]] to [[G4314]] you [[G4771]] a message [[G4487]] by [[G1722]] which [[G3739]] you [[G4771]] and [[G2532]] all [[G3956]] your [[G4771]] household [[G3624]] will be saved.’ [[G4982]]

### 15
[As] [[G1161]] I [[G1473]] began [[G756]] to speak, [[G2980]] the [[G3588]] Holy [[G40]] Spirit [[G4151]] fell [[G1968]] on [[G1909]] them, [[G846]] just as [[G5618]] [He had come] [[G2532]] upon [[G1909]] us [[G1473]] at [[G1722]] [the] beginning. [[G746]]

### 16
Then [[G1161]] I remembered [[G3403]] the [[G3588]] word [[G4487]] of the [[G3588]] Lord, [[G2962]] as [[G5613]] He used to say, [[G2036]] ‘John [[G2491]] baptized [[G907]] with water, [[G5204]] but [[G1161]] you [[G4771]] will be baptized [[G907]] with [[G1722]] [the] Holy [[G40]] Spirit.’ [[G4151]]

### 17
So [[G3767]] if [[G1487]] God [[G2316]] gave [[G1325]] them [[G846]] the [[G3588]] same [[G2470]] gift [[G1431]] as [[G5613]] [He gave] [[G2532]] us [[G1473]] who believed [[G4100]] in [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ, [[G5547]] who [[G5101]] was [[G1510]] I [[G1473]] to [[G1415]] hinder [the work of] [[G2967]] God? [[G2316]]

### 18
[When] [[G1161]] they heard [[G191]] [this], [[G3778]] [ their objections ] were put to rest, [[G2270]] and [[G2532]] they glorified [[G1392]] God, [[G2316]] saying, [[G3004]] “So then, [[G686]] God [[G2316]] has granted [[G1325]] even [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] Gentiles [[G1484]] repentance [[G3341]] unto [[G1519]] life.” [[G2222]]

### 19
Meanwhile, [[G3767]] those [[G3588]] scattered [[G1289]] by [[G575]] the [[G3588]] persecution [[G2347]] that began [[G1096]] with [[G1909]] Stephen [[G4736]] traveled as far as [[G1330]] Phoenicia, [[G5403]] Cyprus, [[G2954]] and [[G2532]] Antioch, [[G490]] speaking [[G2980]] the [[G3588]] message [[G3056]] only [[G3367]] to Jews. [[G2453]]

### 20
But [[G1161]] some [[G5100]] of [[G1537]] them, [[G846]] men [[G435]] from Cyprus [[G2953]] and [[G2532]] Cyrene, [[G2956]] went [[G2064]] to [[G1519]] Antioch [[G490]] and began speaking [[G2980]] to [[G4314]] the [[G3588]] Greeks [[G1675]] as well, [[G2532]] proclaiming the good news [[G2097]] about the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] Jesus. [[G2424]]

### 21
[The] hand [[G5495]] of [the] Lord [[G2962]] was [[G1510]] with [[G3326]] them, [[G846]] and [[G5037]] [a] great [[G4183]] number [of people] [[G706]] believed [[G4100]] [and] turned [[G1994]] to [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] Lord. [[G2962]]

### 22
[When] [[G1161]] news [[G3056]] of [[G4012]] this [[G846]] [reached] [[G191]] the [[G3588]] ears [[G3775]] of the [[G3588]] church [[G1577]] in [[G1722]] Jerusalem, [[G2419]] they sent [[G1821]] Barnabas [[G921]] to [[G1330]] Antioch. [[G490]]

### 23
[When] he [[G3739]] arrived [[G3854]] and [[G2532]] saw [[G3708]] the [[G3588]] grace [[G5485]] of [[G3588]] God, [[G2316]] he rejoiced [[G5463]] and [[G2532]] encouraged [[G3870]] them all [[G3956]] to abide [[G4357]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] with [[G3588]] all their [[G4286]] hearts. [[G2588]]

### 24
[Barnabas] was [[G1510]] a good [[G18]] man, [[G435]] full [[G4134]] of [the] Holy [[G40]] Spirit [[G4151]] and [[G2532]] faith, [[G4102]] and [[G2532]] a great [[G2425]] [number of people] [[G3793]] were brought [[G4369]] to the [[G3588]] Lord. [[G2962]]

### 25
Then [[G1161]] [Barnabas] went [[G1831]] to [[G1519]] Tarsus [[G5019]] to look for [[G327]] Saul, [[G4569]]

### 26
and [when] [[G2532]] he found [him], [[G2147]] he brought [him] [[G71]] back to [[G1519]] Antioch. [[G490]] [So] [[G1161]] [for] a full [[G3650]] year [[G1763]] they [[G846]] met together [[G4863]] with [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] church [[G1577]] and [[G2532]] taught [[G1321]] large [[G2425]] [numbers of people]. [[G3793]] The [[G3588]] disciples [[G3101]] were first called [[G5537]] Christians [[G5546]] at [[G1722]] Antioch. [[G490]]

### 27
In [[G1722]] those [[G3778]] days [[G2250]] [some] prophets [[G4396]] came down [[G2718]] from [[G575]] Jerusalem [[G2414]] to [[G1519]] Antioch. [[G490]]

### 28
One [[G1520]] of [[G1537]] them [[G846]] named [[G3686]] Agabus [[G13]] stood up [[G450]] [and] predicted [[G4591]] through [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] Spirit [that] [[G4151]] a great [[G3173]] famine [[G3042]] would [[G3195]] sweep [[G1510]] across [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] entire [[G3650]] [ Roman ] world. [[G3625]] ([This] [[G3748]] happened [[G1096]] under [[G1909]] Claudius.) [[G2804]]

### 29
[So] [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] disciples, [[G3101]] each [[G1538]] according to [[G2531]] his ability, [[G2141]] decided [[G3724]] to send [[G3992]] relief [[G1248]] to the [[G3588]] brothers [[G80]] living [[G2730]] in [[G1722]] Judea. [[G2449]]

### 30
This [[G3739]] they did, [[G4160]] sending [their gifts] [[G649]] to [[G4314]] the [[G3588]] elders [[G4245]] with [[G1223]] Barnabas [[G921]] and [[G2532]] Saul. [[G4569]]
