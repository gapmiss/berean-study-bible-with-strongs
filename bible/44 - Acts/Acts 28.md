### 1
[Once] [[G2532]] we were safely ashore, [[G1295]] we learned [[G1921]] that [[G3754]] the [[G3588]] island [[G3520]] was called [[G2564]] Malta. [[G3194]]

### 2
The [[G3588]] islanders [[G915]] showed [[G3930]] us [[G1473]] extraordinary [[G5177]] kindness. [[G5363]] They kindled [[G681]] a fire [[G4443]] [and] welcomed [[G4355]] all [[G3956]] of us [[G1473]] because [it was] [[G1223]] raining [[G5205]] and [[G2532]] cold. [[G5592]]

### 3
Paul [[G3972]] gathered [[G4962]] a [[G5100]] bundle [[G4128]] of sticks, [[G5434]] and [[G2532]] as he laid [them] [[G2007]] on [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] fire, [[G4443]] a viper, [[G2191]] driven [[G1831]] out [[G575]] by the [[G3588]] heat, [[G2329]] fastened [itself] [[G2510]] to [[G3588]] his [[G846]] hand. [[G5495]]

### 4
When [[G5613]] the [[G3588]] islanders [[G915]] saw [[G3708]] the [[G3588]] creature [[G2342]] hanging [[G2910]] from [[G1537]] his [[G846]] hand, [[G5495]] they said [[G2036]] to [[G4314]] one another, [[G240]] “Surely [[G3843]] this [[G3778]] man [[G444]] is [[G1510]] a murderer. [[G5406]] [Although he] [[G3739]] was saved [[G1295]] from [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] sea, [[G2281]] Justice [[G1349]] {has} not [[G3756]] allowed [him] [[G1439]] to live. [[G2198]]

### 5
But [[G3303]] [Paul] shook [[G660]] the [[G3588]] creature [[G2342]] {off} into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] fire [[G4442]] [and] suffered [[G3958]] no [[G3762]] ill effects. [[G2556]]

### 6
[The islanders] were expecting [[G4328]] him [[G846]] to [[G3195]] swell up [[G4092]] or [[G2228]] suddenly [[G869]] drop [[G2667]] dead. [[G3498]] But [[G1161]] after waiting [[G4328]] a long [[G4183]] time [[G1909]] and [[G2532]] seeing [[G2334]] nothing [[G3367]] unusual [[G824]] happen [[G1096]] to [[G1519]] him, [[G846]] they changed their minds [[G3328]] [and] said [[G2036]] he [[G846]] was [[G1510]] a god. [[G2316]]

### 7
Nearby [[G1722]] stood [[G5225]] an estate [[G5564]] belonging to the [[G3588]] Publius, [[G4196]] [the] chief official [[G4413]] of the [[G3588]] island. [[G3520]] [He] [[G3739]] welcomed [[G324]] us [[G1473]] [and] entertained [us] [[G3579]] hospitably [[G5390]] [for] three [[G5140]] days. [[G2250]]

### 8
The [[G3588]] father [[G3962]] of Publius [[G4196]] was [[G1096]] sick in bed, [[G2621]] suffering from [[G4912]] fever [[G4446]] and [[G2532]] dysentery. [[G1420]] Paul [[G3972]] went in [[G1525]] to [see] [[G4314]] [him], [[G3739]] and [[G2532]] after praying [[G4336]] [and] placing [[G2007]] [his] [[G3588]] hands [[G5495]] on him, [[G846]] he healed [[G2390]] [the man]. [[G846]]

### 9
[After] [[G1161]] this [[G3778]] had happened, [[G1096]] the [[G3588]] rest [[G3062]] of the [[G3588]] sick [[G769]] on [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] island [[G3520]] came [[G4334]] and [[G2532]] were cured [[G2323]] as well. [[G2532]]

### 10
[The islanders] [[G3739]] honored [[G5091]] us [[G1473]] in many [[G4183]] ways [[G5092]] and [[G2532]] supplied [[G2007]] [our] [[G3588]] needs [[G5532]] [when we were ready] to sail. [[G321]]

### 11
After [[G3326]] three [[G5140]] months [[G3376]] we set sail [[G321]] in [[G1722]] an Alexandrian [[G222]] ship [[G4143]] that had wintered [[G3914]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] island. [[G3520]] It had the Twin Brothers [[G1359]] as a figurehead. [[G3902]]

### 12
Putting in [[G2609]] at [[G1519]] Syracuse, [[G4946]] we stayed there [[G1961]] three [[G5140]] days. [[G2250]]

### 13
From [there] [[G3606]] we weighed anchor [[G4014]] and came [[G2658]] to [[G1519]] Rhegium. [[G4484]] After [[G3326]] one [[G1520]] day, [[G2250]] a south wind [[G3558]] came up, [[G1920]] [and] on the second day [[G1206]] we arrived [[G2064]] at [[G1519]] Puteoli. [[G4223]]

### 14
[There] [[G3757]] we found [[G2147]] [some] brothers [[G80]] who invited us [[G3870]] to spend [[G1961]] [the week[ [[G2033]] with [[G3844]] them. [[G846]] And [[G2532]] so [[G3779]] we came [[G2064]] to [[G1519]] Rome. [[G4516]]

### 15
The [[G3588]] brothers [[G80]] there [[G2547]] had heard [[G191]] about [[G4012]] us [[G1473]] [and] traveled [[G2064]] as far as [[G891]] [the] Forum [[G5410]] of Appius [[G675]] and [[G2532]] [the] Three [[G5140]] Taverns [[G4999]] to [[G1519]] meet [[G529]] us. [[G1473]] [When} [[G3588]] Paul [[G3972]] saw [[G3708]] [them], [[G3739]] he was encouraged [[G2294]] and gave thanks [[G2168]] to God. [[G2316]]

### 16
When [[G3753]] we arrived [[G1525]] in [[G1519]] Rome, [[G4516]] Paul [[G3972]] was permitted [[G2010]] to stay [[G3306]] by [[G2596]] himself, [[G1438]] with [[G4862]] a soldier [[G4757]] to guard [[G5442]] him. [[G846]]

### 17
After [[G3326]] three [[G5140]] days, [[G2250]] he [[G846]] called together [[G4779]] the [[G3588]] leaders [[G4413]] of the [[G3588]] Jews. [[G2453]] [When] [[G1161]] they [[G846]] had gathered, [[G4905]] he said [[G2036]] to [[G4314]] them, [[G846]] “Brothers, [[G80]] [although] I have done [[G4160]] nothing [[G3762]] against [[G1727]] [our] [[G3588]] people [[G2992]] or [[G2228]] the [[G3588]] customs [[G1485]] of our fathers, [[G3971]] I [[G1473]] was taken prisoner [[G1198]] in [[G1537]] Jerusalem [[G2414]] [and] handed over [[G3860]] to [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] Romans. [[G4514]]

### 18
[They] [[G3748]] examined [[G350]] me [[G1473]] [and] wanted [[G1014]] to release [me], [[G630]] because [[G1223]] there was [[G5225]] no [[G3367]] basis [[G156]] for a death sentence [[G2288]] against [[G1722]] me. [[G1473]]

### 19
But [[G1161]] [when] the [[G3588]] Jews [[G2453]] objected, [[G483]] I was compelled [[G315]] to appeal to [[G1941]] Caesar, [[G2541]] [even though] [[G5613]] I have [[G2192]] no [[G3756]] [charge] [[G5100]] to bring against [[G2723]] my [[G1473]] nation. [[G1484]]

### 20
So [[G3767]] for [[G1223]] this [[G3778]] reason [[G156]] I have called [[G3870]] to see [[G3708]] you [[G4771]] and [[G2532]] speak with [you]. [[G4354]] [It is] [[G1063]] because of [[G1752]] the [[G3588]] hope [[G1680]] of Israel [[G2474]] [that] I am bound with [[G4029]] this [[G3778]] chain.” [[G254]]

### 21
[The leaders] replied, [[G2036]] “We [[G1473]] have not received [[G1209]] [any] letters [[G1121]] about [[G4012]] you [[G4771]] from [[G575]] Judea, [[G2449]] nor [[G3777]] {have} any [[G5100]] of the [[G3588]] brothers [[G80]] [from there] [[G3854]] reported [[G518]] or even [[G2228]] mentioned [[G2980]] anything [[G5100]] bad [[G4190]] about [[G4012]] you. [[G4771]]

### 22
But [[G1161]] we consider [[G515]] your views [[G5426]] {worth} hearing, [[G191]] because [[G1063]] we [[G1473]] know [[G1110]] that [[G3754]] [people] everywhere [[G3837]] are speaking against [[G483]] this [[G3778]] sect.” [[G139]]

### 23
So [[G1161]] they set [[G5021]] a day [[G2250]] to [meet with Paul], [[G846]] [and] many [people] [[G4119]] came [[G2064]] to [[G4314]] [the place] [[G3588]] he was staying. [[G3578]] He expounded [[G1620]] to [them] [[G3739]] from [[G575]] morning [[G4404]] to [[G2193]] evening, [[G2073]] testifying about [[G1263]] the [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] of God [[G2316]] and [[G5037]] persuading [[G3982]] them [[G846]] about [[G4012]] Jesus [[G2424]] from [[G575]] the [[G3588]] Law [[G3551]] of Moses [[G3475]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] Prophets. [[G4396]]

### 24
Some [of them] [[G3588]] were convinced [[G3982]] by what [[G3588]] he said, [[G3004]] but [[G1161]] [others] [[G3588]] refused to believe. [[G569]]

### 25
They disagreed [[G800]] among [[G4314]] [themselves] [[G240]] [and] began to leave [[G630]] [after] Paul [[G3972]] had made [[G2036]] [this final] [[G1520]] statement: [[G4487]] “The [[G3588]] Holy [[G40]] Spirit [[G4151]] was right [[G2573]] when He spoke [[G2980]] to [[G4314]] your [[G4771]] fathers [[G3962]] through [[G1223]] Isaiah [[G2268]] the [[G3588]] prophet: [[G4396]]

### 26
‘Go [[G4198]] to [[G4314]] this [[G3778]] people [[G2992]] and [[G2532]] say, [[G2036]] “You will be ever hearing [[G189]] [but] [[G2532]] never [[G3756]] understanding; [[G4920]] you will be ever seeing [[G991]] [but] [[G2532]] never [[G3756]] perceiving.” [[G3708]]

### 27
For [[G1063]] this [[G3778]] people’s [[G2992]] heart [[G2588]] has grown callous; [[G3975]] they hardly hear [[G191]] with [their] [[G3588]] ears, [[G3775]] and [[G2532]] they have closed [[G2576]] their [[G846]] eyes. [[G3788]] Otherwise [[G3361]] they might see [[G3708]] with [their] [[G3588]] eyes, [[G3788]] hear [[G191]] with [their] [[G3588]] ears, [[G3775]] understand [[G4920]] with [their] [[G3588]] hearts, [[G2588]] and [[G2532]] turn, [[G1994]] and [[G2532]] I would heal [[G2390]] them.’ [[G846]]

### 28
Be [[G1510]] advised, [[G1110]] therefore, [[G3767]] that [[G3754]] God’s [[G2316]] salvation [[G4992]] has been sent [[G649]] to the [[G3588]] Gentiles, [[G1484]] and [[G2532]] they [[G846]] will listen!” [[G191]]

### 29
And [[G2532]] he [[G847]] having said [[G2036]] these things, [[G3778]] the [[G3739]] Jews [[G2453]] went away, [[G565]] having [[G2192]] much [[G4183]] reasoning [[G4803]] among [[G1722]] themselves. [[G1438]]

### 30
[Paul] stayed there [[G1696]] two full years [[G1333]] in [[G1722]] his own [[G2398]] rented house, [[G3410]] welcoming [[G588]] all [[G3956]] who [[G3588]] came [[G1531]] to [visit] [[G4314]] him. [[G846]]

### 31
Boldly [[G3954]] [and] freely [[G209]] he proclaimed [[G2784]] the [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] of God [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] taught [[G1321]] about [[G4012]] the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ. [[G5547]]
