###### 1
At [[G1722]] Caesarea [[G2542]] [there was] a [[G5100]] man [[G435]] named [[G3686]] Cornelius, [[G2883]] a centurion [[G1543]] in [[G1537]] what [[G3588]] was called [[G2564]] [the] Italian [[G2483]] Regiment. [[G4686]]

###### 2
[He and] [[G4862]] all [[G3956]] his [[G846]] household [[G3624]] [were] devout [[G2152]] and [[G2532]] God-fearing. [[G5399]] He gave generously [[G4160]] to the [[G3588]] people [[G2992]] and [[G2532]] prayed [[G1189]] to [[G3588]] God [[G2316]] regularly. [[G1223]]

###### 3
[One] [[G3588]] day [[G2250]] at about [[G5616]] the ninth [[G1766]] hour, [[G5610]] he had a clear vision [[G3708]] of an angel [[G32]] of God [[G2316]] who came [[G1525]] to [[G4314]] him [[G846]] and [[G2532]] said, [[G2036]] “Cornelius!” [[G2883]]

###### 4
[Cornelius] stared [[G816]] at him [[G846]] in fear [[G1719]] and [[G2532]] asked, [[G2036]] “What [[G5101]] is it, [[G1510]] Lord?” [[G2962]] [The angel] answered, [[G2036]] “Your [[G4771]] prayers [[G4335]] and [[G2532]] gifts to the poor [[G1654]] have ascended [[G305]] as [[G1519]] a memorial [ offering ] [[G3422]] before [[G1715]] God. [[G2316]]

###### 5
Now [[G3568]] send [[G3992]] men [[G435]] to [[G1519]] Joppa [[G2445]] to call for [[G3343]] a man [named] [[G5100]] Simon [[G4613]] who [[G3739]] is called [[G1941]] Peter. [[G4074]]

###### 6
He [[G3778]] is staying [[G3579]] with [[G3844]] Simon [[G4613]] [the] tanner, [[G1038]] whose [[G3739]] house [[G3614]] is [[G1510]] by [[G3844]] [the] sea.” [[G2281]]

###### 7
When [[G5613]] the [[G3588]] angel [[G32]] who [[G3588]] spoke [[G2980]] to him [[G846]] had gone, [[G565]] [Cornelius] called [[G5455]] two [[G1417]] of [his] [[G3588]] servants [[G3610]] and [[G2532]] a devout [[G2152]] soldier [[G4757]] from among [[G3588]] his personal attendants. [[G4342]]

###### 8
He explained [[G1834]] what had happened [[G537]] [and] sent [[G649]] them [[G846]] to [[G1519]] Joppa. [[G2445]]

###### 9
The [[G3588]] next day [[G1887]] at about [[G4012]] the sixth [[G1623]] hour, [[G5610]] as [[G1565]] [the men] were approaching [[G1448]] the [[G3588]] city [[G4172]] on their journey, [[G3596]] Peter [[G4074]] went up [[G305]] on [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] roof [[G1430]] to pray. [[G4336]]

###### 10
He became [[G1096]] hungry [[G4361]] and [[G2532]] wanted [something] [[G2309]] to eat, [[G1089]] but [[G1161]] [while] [[G846]] the meal was being prepared, [[G3903]] he [[G846]] fell [[G1096]] into [[G1909]] a trance. [[G1611]]

###### 11
He saw [[G2334]] heaven [[G3772]] open [[G455]] and [[G2532]] something [[G5100]] like [[G5613]] a large [[G3173]] sheet [[G3607]] being let down [[G2524]] to [[G1909]] earth [[G1093]] by its four [[G5064]] corners. [[G746]]

###### 12
It contained [[G1722]] all kinds of [[G3956]] four-footed animals [[G5074]] and [[G2532]] reptiles [[G2062]] of the [[G3588]] earth, [[G1093]] as well as [[G2532]] birds [[G4071]] of [[G3588]] the air. [[G3772]]

###### 13
Then [[G2532]] a voice [[G5456]] [spoke] [[G1096]] to [[G4314]] him: [[G846]] “Get up, [[G450]] Peter, [[G4074]] kill [[G2380]] and [[G2532]] eat!” [[G5315]]

###### 14
“No, [[G3365]] Lord!” [[G2962]] Peter [[G4074]] answered. [[G2036]] “I have never eaten [[G5315]] anything [[G3956]] impure [[G2839]] or [[G2532]] unclean.” [[G169]]

###### 15
[The] voice [[G5456]] [spoke] to [[G4314]] him [[G846]] a second time: [[G1208]] “Do not call anything impure [[G2840]] that [[G3739]] God [[G2316]] has made clean.” [[G2511]]

###### 16
This [[G3778]] happened [[G1096]] three times, [[G5151]] and [[G2532]] all at once [[G2112]] the [[G3588]] [sheet] [[G4632]] was taken back up [[G353]] into [[G1519]] heaven. [[G3772]]

###### 17
While [[G5613]] Peter [[G4074]] was puzzling over [[G1280]] the meaning [[G1510]] of the [[G3588]] vision, [[G3705]] the [[G3588]] men [[G435]] sent [[G649]] by [[G5259]] Cornelius [[G2883]] found [[G1331]] Simon’s [[G4613]] house [[G3614]] [and] approached [[G2186]] the [[G3588]] gate. [[G4440]]

###### 18
They called out [[G5455]] to ask [[G4441]] if [[G1487]] Simon [[G4613]] called [[G1941]] Peter [[G4074]] was staying [[G3579]] [there]. [[G1759]]

###### 19
As [[G1161]] Peter [[G4074]] continued to reflect [[G1760]] on [[G4012]] the [[G3588]] vision, [[G3705]] the [[G3588]] Spirit [[G4151]] told [[G2036]] him, [[G846]] “Three [[G5140]] men [[G435]] are here [[G2400]] looking for [[G2212]] you. [[G4771]]

###### 20
Get up! [[G450]] Go downstairs [[G2597]] and [[G2532]] accompany [[G4198]] them [[G846]] without [[G3367]] hesitation, [[G1252]] because [[G3754]] I [[G1473]] have sent [[G649]] them.” [[G846]]

###### 21
[So] [[G1161]] Peter [[G4074]] went down [[G2597]] to [[G4314]] the [[G3588]] men [[G435]] [and] said, [[G2036]] “Here [[G2400]] am [[G1510]] I, [[G1473]] the one [[G3739]] you are looking for. [[G2212]] Why [[G5101]] have you come?” [[G3918]]

###### 22
“Cornelius [[G2883]] [the] centurion [ has sent us ],” [[G1543]] they said. [[G2036]] “[He is] a righteous [[G1342]] and [[G2532]] God-fearing [[G2316]] man [[G435]] [with] [[G5037]] a good reputation [[G3140]] among [[G5259]] the [[G3588]] whole [[G3650]] Jewish [[G2453]] nation. [[G1484]] A holy [[G40]] angel [[G32]] instructed [him] [[G5537]] to request your presence [[G3343]] in [[G1519]] his [[G846]] home, [[G3624]] [so that he could] [[G2532]] hear [[G191]] a message [[G4487]] from [[G3844]] you.” [[G4771]]

###### 23
So [[G3767]] [Peter] invited them in [[G1528]] as his guests. [[G3579]] And [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] next day [[G1887]] he got ready [[G450]] [and] went [[G1831]] with [[G4862]] them, [[G846]] accompanied by [[G4905]] some [[G5100]] of the [[G3588]] brothers [[G80]] from [[G575]] Joppa. [[G2445]]

###### 24
The [[G3588]] following day [[G1887]] he arrived [[G1525]] in [[G1519]] Caesarea, [[G2542]] [where] [[G1161]] Cornelius [[G2883]] was [[G1510]] expecting [[G4328]] them [[G846]] [and] had called together [[G4779]] his [[G846]] relatives [[G4773]] and [[G2532]] close [[G316]] friends. [[G5384]]

###### 25
As [[G5613]] Peter [[G4074]] was about [[G1096]] to enter, [[G1525]] Cornelius [[G2883]] met [[G4876]] him [[G846]] [and] fell [[G4098]] at [[G1909]] [his] [[G3588]] feet [[G4228]] to worship [him]. [[G4352]]

###### 26
But [[G1161]] Peter [[G4074]] helped him up. [[G1453]] “Stand up,” [[G450]] he said, [[G3004]] “I [[G1473]] am [[G1510]] only [[G2532]] a man [[G444]] myself.” [[G846]]

###### 27
[As] [[G2532]] [Peter] talked with [[G4926]] him, [[G846]] he went inside [[G1525]] and [[G2532]] found [[G2147]] many [people] [[G4183]] gathered together. [[G4905]]

###### 28
He said [[G5346]] to [[G4314]] them, [[G846]] “You [[G4771]] know [[G1987]] how [[G5613]] unlawful [[G111]] it is [[G1510]] for a Jew [[G2453]] to associate with [[G2853]] a foreigner [[G246]] or [[G2228]] visit [him]. [[G4334]] But [[G3588]] God [[G2316]] has shown [[G1166]] me [that] [[G2504]] I should not call [[G3004]] [any] man [[G444]] impure [[G2839]] or [[G2228]] unclean. [[G169]]

###### 29
So [[G1352]] when I was invited, [[G3343]] I came [[G2064]] without objection. [[G369]] I ask, [[G4441]] then, [[G3767]] why [[G5101]] have you sent for [[G3343]] me?” [[G1473]]

###### 30
Cornelius [[G2883]] answered: [[G5346]] “Four [[G5067]] days [[G2250]] ago, [[G575]] I was [[G1510]] in [[G1722]] my [[G1473]] house [[G3624]] praying [[G4336]] at [[G3360]] this, [[G3778]] the [[G3588]] ninth [[G1766]] hour. [[G5610]] Suddenly [[G2400]] a man [[G435]] in [[G1722]] radiant [[G2986]] clothing [[G2066]] stood [[G2476]] before [[G1799]] me [[G1473]]

###### 31
and [[G2532]] said, [[G5346]] ‘Cornelius, [[G2883]] your [[G4771]] prayer [[G4335]] has been heard, [[G1522]] and [[G2532]] your [[G4771]] gifts to the poor [[G1654]] have been remembered [[G3403]] before [[G1799]] God. [[G2316]]

###### 32
Therefore [[G3767]] send [[G3992]] to [[G1519]] Joppa [[G2445]] for [[G3333]] Simon, [[G4613]] who [[G3739]] is called [[G1941]] Peter. [[G4074]] He [[G3778]] is a guest [[G3579]] in [[G1722]] [the] home [[G3614]] of Simon [[G4613]] [the] tanner, [[G1038]] by [[G3844]] [the] sea.’ [[G2281]]

###### 33
So [[G3767]] I sent [[G3992]] for [[G4314]] you [[G4771]] immediately, [[G1824]] and [[G5037]] you [[G4771]] were [[G4160]] kind enough [[G2573]] to come. [[G3854]] Now [[G3568]] then, [[G3767]] we [[G1473]] {are} all [[G3956]] here [[G3918]] in the presence [[G1799]] of God [[G2316]] to listen to [[G191]] everything [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] has instructed [[G4367]] you [to tell us]. [[G4771]]

###### 34
Then [[G1161]] Peter [[G4074]] began to speak: [[G455]] “I now truly understand [[G2638]] that [[G3754]] God [[G2316]] does [[G1510]] not [[G3756]] show favoritism, [[G4381]]

###### 35
but [[G235]] welcomes [[G1184]] those [[G3588]] from [[G1722]] every [[G3956]] nation [[G1484]] who fear [[G5399]] Him [[G846]] and [[G2532]] do [[G2038]] what is right. [[G1343]]

###### 36
He has sent [[G649]] [this] [[G3588]] message [[G3056]] to the [[G3588]] people [[G5207]] of Israel, [[G2474]] proclaiming the gospel [[G2097]] of peace [[G1515]] through [[G1223]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ, [[G5547]] [who] [[G3778]] is [[G1510]] Lord [[G2962]] of all. [[G3956]]

###### 37
You yourselves [[G4771]] know [[G1492]] what has happened [[G4487]] throughout [[G2596]] Judea, [[G2449]] beginning [[G756]] in [[G575]] Galilee [[G1056]] with [[G3326]] the [[G3588]] baptism [[G908]] that [[G3739]] John [[G2491]] proclaimed: [[G2784]]

###### 38
how [[G5613]] God [[G2316]] anointed [[G5548]] Jesus [[G2424]] of [[G575]] Nazareth [[G3478]] with [the] Holy [[G40]] Spirit [[G4151]] and [[G2532]] with power, [[G1411]] [and] how [Jesus] [[G3739]] went around [[G1330]] doing good [[G2109]] and [[G2532]] healing [[G2390]] all [[G3956]] who [[G3588]] were oppressed [[G2616]] by [[G5259]] the [[G3588]] devil, [[G1228]] because [[G3754]] God [[G2316]] was [[G1510]] with [[G3326]] Him. [[G846]]

###### 39
We [[G1473]] [are] witnesses [[G3144]] of all [[G3956]] that [[G3739]] He did, [[G4160]] both [[G5037]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] land [[G5561]] of the [[G3588]] Jews [[G2453]] and [[G2532]] in [[G1722]] Jerusalem. [[G2419]] And although [[G2532]] they put [Him] to death [[G337]] by hanging [Him] [[G2910]] on [[G1909]] a tree, [[G3586]]

###### 40
God [[G2316]] raised [Him] up [[G1453]] on [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] third [[G5154]] day [[G2250]] and [[G2532]] caused [[G1325]] Him [[G846]] to be [[G1096]] seen— [[G1717]]

###### 41
not [[G3756]] by all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] people, [[G2992]] but [[G235]] by the witnesses [[G3144]] God [[G2316]] had chosen beforehand, [[G4401]] by us [[G1473]] who [[G3748]] ate [[G4906]] and [[G2532]] drank with [[G4844]] Him [[G846]] after [[G3326]] He [[G846]] rose [[G450]] from [[G1537]] [the] dead. [[G3498]]

###### 42
And [[G2532]] He commanded [[G3853]] us [[G1473]] to preach [[G2784]] to the [[G3588]] people [[G2992]] and [[G2532]] to testify [[G1263]] that [[G3754]] He [[G3778]] is [[G1510]] the [One] [[G3588]] appointed [[G3724]] by [[G5259]] God [[G2316]] to judge [[G2923]] [the] living [[G2198]] and [[G2532]] [the] dead. [[G3498]]

###### 43
All [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] prophets [[G4396]] testify [[G3140]] about Him [[G3778]] [that] everyone [[G3956]] who [[G3588]] believes [[G4100]] in [[G1519]] Him [[G846]] receives [[G2983]] forgiveness [[G859]] of sins [[G266]] through [[G1223]] His [[G846]] name.” [[G3686]]

###### 44
[While] Peter [[G4074]] was still speaking [[G2980]] these [[G3778]] words, [[G4487]] the [[G3588]] Holy [[G40]] Spirit [[G4151]] fell [[G1968]] on [[G1909]] all [[G3956]] who [[G3588]] heard [[G191]] [his] [[G3588]] message. [[G3056]]

###### 45
All [[G3745]] the [[G3588]] circumcised [[G4061]] believers [[G4103]] [who] had accompanied [[G4905]] Peter [[G4074]] were amazed [[G1839]] that [[G3754]] the [[G3588]] gift [[G1431]] of the [[G3588]] Holy [[G40]] Spirit [[G4151]] had been poured out [[G1632]] even [[G2532]] on [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] Gentiles. [[G1484]]

###### 46
For [[G1063]] they heard [[G191]] them [[G846]] speaking [[G2980]] in tongues [[G1100]] and [[G2532]] exalting [[G3170]] God. [[G2316]] Then [[G5119]] Peter [[G4074]] said, [[G611]]

###### 47
“Can [[G1410]] anyone [[G5100]] withhold [[G2967]] the [[G3588]] water [[G5204]] to baptize [[G907]] these [people]? [[G3778]] [They] [[G3748]] have received [[G2983]] the [[G3588]] Holy [[G40]] Spirit [[G4151]] just as [[G5613]] we [[G1473]] [have]!” [[G2532]]

###### 48
So [[G1161]] he ordered that [[G4367]] they be baptized [[G907]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] name [[G3686]] of Jesus [[G2424]] Christ. [[G5547]] Then [[G5119]] they asked [[G2065]] him [[G846]] to stay [[G1961]] [for a few] [[G5100]] days. [[G2250]]
