###### 1
And [[G1161]] Saul [[G4569]] was there, [[G1510]] giving approval [[G4909]] to [[G3588]] [Stephen’s] [[G846]] death. [[G336]] On [[G1722]] that [[G1565]] day [[G2250]] a great [[G3173]] persecution [[G1375]] broke out [[G1096]] against [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] church [[G1577]] in [[G1722]] Jerusalem, [[G2414]] and [[G1161]] all [[G3956]] except [[G4133]] the [[G3588]] apostles [[G652]] were scattered [[G1289]] throughout [[G2596]] Judea [[G2449]] and [[G2532]] Samaria. [[G4540]]

###### 2
God-fearing [[G2126]] men [[G435]] buried [[G4792]] Stephen [[G4736]] and [[G2532]] mourned deeply [[G2870]] over [[G1909]] him. [[G846]]

###### 3
But [[G1161]] Saul [[G4569]] began to destroy [[G3075]] the [[G3588]] church. [[G1577]] Going [[G1531]] from house to house, [[G2596]] he dragged off [[G4951]] men [[G435]] and [[G2532]] women [[G1135]] [and] put [them] [[G3860]] in [[G1519]] prison. [[G5438]]

###### 4
Those who [[G3588]] had been scattered [[G1289]] preached [[G2097]] the [[G3588]] word [[G3056]] wherever they went. [[G1330]]

###### 5
Philip [[G5376]] went down [[G2718]] to [[G1519]] [a] city [[G4172]] [in] Samaria [[G4540]] [and] proclaimed [[G2784]] the [[G3588]] Christ [[G5547]] to them. [[G846]]

###### 6
The [[G3588]] crowds [[G3793]] gave their undivided attention [[G4337]] to Philip’s [[G5376]] message [[G3004]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] signs [[G4592]] they saw [[G991]] him perform. [[G4160]]

###### 7
With loud shrieks, [[G5456]] unclean [[G169]] spirits [[G4151]] came out of [[G1831]] many [[G4183]] who [[G3588]] were possessed, [[G2192]] and [[G1161]] many [[G4183]] [of the] paralyzed [[G3886]] and [[G2532]] lame [[G5560]] were healed. [[G2323]]

###### 8
So [[G1161]] there was [[G1096]] great [[G4183]] joy [[G5479]] in [[G1722]] that [[G1565]] city. [[G4172]]

###### 9
Prior to that time, [[G4391]] a [[G5100]] man [[G435]] named [[G3686]] Simon [[G4613]] had practiced sorcery [[G3096]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] city [[G4172]] and [[G2532]] amazed [[G1839]] the [[G3588]] people [[G1484]] of Samaria. [[G4540]] He claimed [[G3004]] to be [[G1510]] someone [[G5100]] great, [[G3173]]

###### 10
[and] all [the people], [[G3956]] from [[G575]] the least [[G3398]] to [[G2193]] the greatest, [[G3173]] heeded [ his words ] [[G4337]] [and] said, [[G3004]] “This [man] [[G3778]] is [[G1510]] the [[G3588]] divine [[G2316]] power [[G1411]] called [[G2564]] [the] Great [Power].” [[G3173]]

###### 11
They paid close attention [[G4337]] to him [[G846]] because [[G1223]] he had amazed [[G1839]] them [[G846]] for a [[G3588]] long [[G2425]] time [[G5550]] with [his] [[G3588]] sorcery. [[G3095]]

###### 12
But [[G1161]] when [[G3753]] they believed [[G4100]] Philip [[G5376]] as he preached the gospel [[G2097]] of [[G4012]] the [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] of God [[G2316]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] name [[G3686]] of Jesus [[G2424]] Christ, [[G5547]] they were baptized, [[G907]] both [[G5037]] men [[G435]] and [[G2532]] women. [[G1135]]

###### 13
Even [[G2532]] Simon [[G4613]] himself [[G846]] believed [[G4100]] and [[G2532]] was baptized. [[G907]] He followed [[G4342]] Philip {closely} [[G5376]] and [[G5037]] was amazed [[G1839]] [by the] great [[G3173]] signs [[G4592]] and [[G2532]] miracles [[G1411]] he observed. [[G2334]]

###### 14
[When] [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] apostles [[G652]] in [[G1722]] Jerusalem [[G2414]] heard [[G191]] that [[G3754]] Samaria [[G4540]] had received [[G1209]] the [[G3588]] word [[G3056]] of God, [[G2316]] they sent [[G649]] Peter [[G4074]] and [[G2532]] John [[G2491]] to [[G4314]] them. [[G846]]

###### 15
On their arrival, [[G2597]] they prayed [[G4336]] for [[G4012]] them [[G846]] to [[G3704]] receive [[G2983]] [the] Holy [[G40]] Spirit. [[G4151]]

###### 16
For [[G1063]] [the Holy Spirit] had [[G1510]] not yet [[G3764]] fallen [[G1968]] upon [[G1909]] any [[G3762]] of them; [[G846]] they had simply been [[G5225]] baptized [[G907]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] name [[G3686]] of the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] Jesus. [[G2424]]

###### 17
Then [[G5119]] [Peter and John] laid [[G2007]] [their] [[G3588]] hands [[G5495]] on [[G1909]] them, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] they received [[G2983]] [the] Holy [[G40]] Spirit. [[G4151]]

###### 18
[When] [[G1161]] Simon [[G4613]] saw [[G3708]] that [[G3754]] the [[G3588]] Spirit [[G4151]] was given [[G1325]] through [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] laying on [[G1936]] of the [[G3588]] apostles’ [[G652]] hands, [[G5495]] he offered [[G4374]] them [[G846]] money. [[G5536]]

###### 19
“Give {me} [[G1325]] this [[G3778]] power [[G1849]] as well,” [[G2504]] he said, [[G3004]] “so that [[G2443]] everyone on whom [[G3739]] I lay [[G2007]] [my] [[G3588]] hands [[G5495]] may receive [[G2983]] [the] Holy [[G40]] Spirit.” [[G4151]]

###### 20
But [[G1161]] Peter [[G4074]] replied, [[G2036]] “{May} your [[G4771]] silver [[G694]] perish [[G1510]] with [[G4862]] you, [[G4771]] because [[G3754]] you thought [[G3543]] you could buy [[G2932]] the [[G3588]] gift [[G1431]] of God [[G2316]] with [[G1223]] money! [[G5536]]

###### 21
You [[G4771]] have [[G1510]] no [[G3756]] part [[G3310]] [or] [[G3761]] share [[G2819]] in [[G1722]] [our] [[G3588]] ministry, [[G3056]] because [[G1063]] your [[G4771]] heart [[G2588]] is [[G1510]] not [[G3756]] right [[G2117]] before [[G1725]] God. [[G2316]]

###### 22
Repent, [[G3340]] therefore, [[G3767]] of [[G575]] your [[G4771]] wickedness, [[G2549]] and [[G2532]] pray to [[G1189]] the [[G3588]] Lord. [[G2962]] Perhaps [[G687]] He will forgive [[G863]] you [[G4771]] for the [[G3588]] intent [[G1963]] of [[G3588]] your [[G4771]] heart. [[G2588]]

###### 23
For [[G1063]] I see that [[G3708]] you [[G4771]] are [[G1510]] poisoned [[G5521]] by bitterness [[G4088]] and [[G2532]] captive [[G4886]] to iniquity.” [[G93]]

###### 24
Then [[G1161]] Simon [[G4613]] answered, [[G611]] “Pray [[G1189]] to [[G4314]] the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] for [[G5228]] me, [[G1473]] so that [[G3704]] nothing [[G3367]] you have said [[G2046]] may happen [[G1904]] to [[G1909]] me.” [[G1473]]

###### 25
[After Peter and John] [[G3588]] had testified [[G1263]] and [[G2532]] spoken [[G2980]] the [[G3588]] word [[G3056]] of the [[G3588]] Lord, [[G2962]] they returned [[G5290]] to [[G1519]] Jerusalem, [[G2414]] preaching the gospel [[G2097]] in many [[G4183]] of the [[G3588]] Samaritan [[G4541]] villages. [[G2968]]

###### 26
Now [[G1161]] an angel [[G32]] of [the] Lord [[G2962]] said [[G2980]] to [[G4314]] Philip, [[G5376]] “Get up [[G450]] and [[G2532]] go [[G4198]] south [[G3314]] to [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] desert [[G2048]] road [[G3598]] that [[G3588]] goes down [[G2597]] from [[G575]] Jerusalem [[G2419]] to [[G1519]] Gaza.” [[G1048]]

###### 27
[So] [[G2532]] he started out, [[G450]] and [[G2532]] on his way [[G4198]] [he met] [[G2400]] an Ethiopian [[G128]] eunuch, [[G2135]] a court official [[G1413]] in charge of [[G1909]] the entire [[G3956]] treasury [[G1047]] of Candace, [[G2582]] queen [[G938]] of [the] Ethiopians. [[G128]] [He] [[G3739]] had gone [[G2064]] to [[G1519]] Jerusalem [[G2419]] to worship, [[G4352]]

###### 28
and [[G5037]] on his return [[G5290]] was [[G1510]] sitting [[G2521]] in [[G1909]] his [[G846]] chariot, [[G716]] reading [[G314]] Isaiah [[G2268]] the [[G3588]] prophet. [[G4396]]

###### 29
The [[G3588]] Spirit [[G4151]] said [[G2036]] to Philip, [[G5376]] “Go over [[G4334]] to [that] [[G3778]] chariot [[G716]] and [[G2532]] stay by [it].” [[G2853]]

###### 30
[So] [[G1161]] Philip [[G5376]] ran up [[G4370]] [and] heard [[G191]] [the man] [[G846]] reading [[G314]] Isaiah [[G2268]] the [[G3588]] prophet. [[G4396]] “Do you understand [[G1097]] what [[G3739]] you are reading?” [[G314]] [Philip] asked. [[G2036]]

###### 31
“How [[G4459]] can I,” [[G1410]] he said, [[G2036]] “unless [[G1437]] someone [[G5100]] guides [[G3594]] me?” [[G1473]] And [[G5037]] he invited [[G3870]] Philip [[G5376]] to come up [[G305]] [and] sit [[G2523]] with [[G4862]] him. [[G846]]

###### 32
[The eunuch] was reading [[G314]] this [[G3778]] passage [[G4042]] of [[G3588]] Scripture: [[G1124]] “He was led [[G71]] like [[G5613]] a sheep [[G4263]] to [[G1909]] [the] slaughter, [[G4967]] and [[G2532]] as [[G5613]] a lamb [[G286]] before [[G1726]] the [[G3588]] shearer [[G2751]] [is] silent, [[G880]] so [[G3779]] He did not open [[G455]] His [[G846]] mouth. [[G4750]]

###### 33
In [[G1722]] His [[G846]] humiliation [[G5014]] He [[G846]] was deprived [[G142]] of justice. [[G2920]] Who [[G5101]] can recount [[G1334]] His [[G846]] descendants? [[G1074]] For [[G3754]] His [[G846]] life [[G2222]] was removed [[G142]] from [[G575]] the [[G3588]] earth.” [[G1093]]

###### 34
“Tell me,” [[G1189]] said [[G2036]] the [[G3588]] eunuch, [[G2135]] “who [[G5101]] {is} the [[G3588]] prophet [[G4396]] talking [[G3004]] about, [[G4012]] himself [[G1438]] or [[G2228]] someone [[G5100]] else?” [[G2087]]

###### 35
Then [[G1161]] Philip [[G5376]] began [[G756]] with [[G575]] this very [[G3778]] Scripture [[G1124]] and [[G2532]] told him the good news about [[G2097]] Jesus. [[G2424]]

###### 36
As [[G5613]] they traveled [[G4198]] along [[G2596]] the [[G3588]] road [[G3598]] [and] came [[G2064]] to [[G1909]] some [[G5100]] water, [[G5204]] the [[G3588]] eunuch [[G2135]] said, [[G5346]] “Look, [[G2400]] [here is] water! [[G5204]] What [[G5101]] is to prevent [[G2967]] me [[G1473]] [from] being baptized?” [[G907]]

###### 37
And [[G1161]] Philip [[G5376]] said, [[G3004]] If [[G1487]] you believe [[G4100]] from [[G1537]] all [[G3650]] the [[G3588]] heart, [[G2588]] it is lawful. [[G1832]] He answered [[G611]] and [[G1161]] he said, [[G2036]] I believe [[G4100]] the [[G3588]] Son [[G5207]] of God [[G2316]] to be [[G1510]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ. [[G5547]]

###### 38
And [[G2532]] he gave orders [[G2753]] to stop [[G2476]] the [[G3588]] chariot. [[G716]] Then [[G2532]] both [[G297]] Philip [[G5376]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] eunuch [[G2135]] went down [[G2597]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] water, [[G5204]] and [[G2532]] [Philip] baptized [[G907]] him. [[G846]]

###### 39
When [[G3753]] they came up [[G305]] out of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] water, [[G5204]] [the] Spirit [[G4151]] of [the] Lord [[G2962]] carried [[G726]] Philip {away}, [[G5376]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] eunuch [[G2135]] saw [[G3708]] him [[G846]] no more, [[G3765]] [but] [[G1063]] went [[G4198]] on his [[G846]] way [[G3598]] rejoicing. [[G5463]]

###### 40
But [[G1161]] Philip [[G5376]] appeared [[G2147]] at [[G1519]] Azotus [[G108]] and [[G2532]] traveled through [that region], [[G1330]] preaching the gospel [[G2097]] in all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] towns [[G4172]] until [[G2193]] he [[G846]] came [[G2064]] to [[G1519]] Caesarea. [[G2542]]
