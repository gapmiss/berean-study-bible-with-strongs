### 1
[ One afternoon ] [[G1161]] Peter [[G4074]] and [[G2532]] John [[G2491]] were going up [[G305]] to [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] temple [[G2411]] at [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] hour [[G5610]] of prayer, [[G4335]] the [[G3588]] ninth [hour]. [[G1766]]

### 2
And [[G2532]] a [[G5100]] man [[G435]] who was [[G5225]] lame [[G5560]] from [[G1537]] birth [[G2836]] was being carried [[G941]] [to] [[G4314]] the [[G3588]] temple [[G2411]] gate [[G2374]] called [[G3004]] Beautiful, [[G5611]] [where] he was put [[G5087]] every [[G2596]] day [[G2250]] to beg [[G154]] from [[G3844]] those [[G3588]] entering [[G1531]] the [[G3588]] temple courts. [[G2411]]

### 3
[When] [[G3739]] he saw [[G3708]] Peter [[G4074]] and [[G2532]] John [[G2491]] about [[G3195]] to enter [[G1524]] the [[G3588]] temple, [[G2411]] he asked [them] [[G2065]] for [[G2983]] money. [[G1654]]

### 4
Peter [[G4074]] looked directly [[G816]] at [[G1519]] him, [[G846]] as [did] [[G4862]] John. [[G2491]] “Look [[G991]] at [[G1519]] us!” [[G1473]] said [Peter]. [[G2036]]

### 5
[So] [[G1161]] [the man] gave them his attention, [[G1907]] expecting [[G4328]] to receive [[G2983]] something [[G5100]] from [[G3844]] them. [[G846]]

### 6
But [[G1161]] Peter [[G4074]] said, [[G2036]] “Silver [[G694]] [or] [[G2532]] gold [[G5553]] I do not have, [[G1473]] but [[G1161]] what [[G3739]] I have [[G2192]] I give [[G1325]] you: [[G4771]] In [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] name [[G3686]] of Jesus [[G2424]] Christ [[G5547]] of [[G3588]] Nazareth, [[G3480]] get up [[G1453]] and [[G2532]] walk! [[G4043]]

### 7
Taking [[G4084]] him [[G846]] by the [[G3588]] right [[G1188]] hand, [[G5495]] [Peter] helped him up, [[G1453]] and [[G1161]] at once [[G3916]] [the man’s] [[G846]] feet [[G939]] and [[G2532]] ankles [[G4974]] were strengthened. [[G4732]]

### 8
He sprang [[G1814]] to his feet [[G2476]] and [[G2532]] began to walk. [[G4043]] Then [[G2532]] he went [[G1525]] with [[G4862]] them [[G846]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] temple [courts], [[G2411]] walking [[G4043]] and [[G2532]] leaping [[G242]] and [[G2532]] praising [[G134]] God. [[G2316]]

### 9
[When] [[G2532]] all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] people [[G2992]] saw [[G3708]] him [[G846]] walking [[G4043]] and [[G2532]] praising [[G134]] God, [[G2316]]

### 10
they recognized [[G1921]] him [[G846]] [as] [[G3754]] the [man] [[G3588]] who used to sit [[G2521]] [begging] [[G1654]] at [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] Beautiful [[G5611]] Gate [[G4439]] of the [[G3588]] temple, [[G2411]] and [[G2532]] they were filled [[G4130]] with wonder [[G2285]] and [[G2532]] amazement [[G1611]] at [[G1909]] what [[G3588]] had happened [[G4819]] to him. [[G846]]

### 11
[While] [[G1161]] [the man] [[G846]] clung to [[G2902]] Peter [[G4074]] and [[G2532]] John, [[G2491]] all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] people [[G2992]] were astonished [[G1569]] [and] ran [[G4936]] to [[G4314]] them [[G846]] in [[G1909]] the [walkway] [[G3588]] called [[G2564]] Solomon’s [[G4672]] Colonnade. [[G4745]]

### 12
[When] Peter [[G4074]] saw [this], [[G3708]] he addressed [[G611]] the [[G3588]] people: [[G2992]] “Men [[G435]] of Israel, [[G2475]] why [[G5101]] are you surprised [[G2296]] by [[G1909]] this? [[G3778]] Why [[G5101]] do you stare [[G816]] at us [[G1473]] as if [[G5613]] by [our] own [[G2398]] power [[G1411]] or [[G2228]] godliness [[G2150]] [we] had made [[G4160]] [this man] [[G846]] walk? [[G4043]]

### 13
The [[G3588]] God [[G2316]] of Abraham, [[G11]] Isaac, [[G2464]] and [[G2532]] Jacob, [[G2384]] the [[G3588]] God [[G2316]] of our [[G1473]] fathers, [[G3962]] has glorified [[G1392]] His [[G846]] servant [[G3816]] Jesus. [[G2424]] You [[G4771]] handed [Him over] [[G3860]] and [[G2532]] rejected [[G720]] [Him] [[G3739]] before [[G4383]] Pilate, [[G4091]] [even though] he [[G1565]] had decided [[G2919]] to release [Him]. [[G630]]

### 14
You [[G4771]] rejected [[G720]] the [[G3588]] Holy [[G40]] and [[G2532]] Righteous One [[G1342]] and [[G2532]] asked that [[G154]] a murderer [[G5406]] be released [[G5483]] to you. [[G4771]]

### 15
You killed [[G615]] the [[G3588]] Author [[G747]] of life, [[G2222]] [but] God [[G2316]] raised [[G1453]] [Him] [[G3739]] from [[G1537]] [the] dead, [[G3498]] [and] we [[G1473]] are [[G1510]] witnesses [[G3144]] of [the fact]. [[G3739]]

### 16
By [[G1909]] faith [[G4102]] in [[G3588]] [the] name [[G3686]] of Jesus, [[G846]] this [man] [[G3778]] whom [[G3739]] you see [[G2334]] and [[G2532]] know [[G1492]] has been made strong. [[G4732]] [It is Jesus’] [[G846]] name [[G3686]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] faith [[G4102]] that [comes] [[G3588]] through [[G1223]] Him [[G846]] [that] has given [[G1325]] him [[G846]] this [[G3778]] complete healing [[G3647]] in your presence. [[G561]]

### 17
And [[G2532]] now, [[G3568]] brothers, [[G80]] I know [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] you acted [[G4238]] in [[G2596]] ignorance, [[G52]] as [did] [[G5618]] your [[G4771]] leaders. [[G758]]

### 18
But [[G1161]] in this way [[G3779]] [God] has fulfilled [[G4137]] what [[G3739]] [He] [[G2316]] foretold [[G4293]] through [[G1223]] all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] prophets, [[G4396]] [saying that] [[G4750]] His [[G846]] Christ [[G5547]] would suffer. [[G3958]]

### 19
Repent, [[G3340]] then, [[G3767]] and [[G2532]] turn back, [[G1994]] so that [[G4314]] your [[G4771]] sins [[G266]] may be wiped away, [[G1813]]

### 20
that [[G3704]] times [[G2540]] of refreshing [[G403]] may come [[G2064]] from [[G575]] [the] presence [[G4383]] of the [[G3588]] Lord, [[G2962]] and [[G2532]] [that] He may send [[G649]] Jesus, [[G2424]] [the] Christ, [[G5547]] who [[G3588]] has been appointed [[G4400]] for you. [[G4771]]

### 21
Heaven [[G3772]] must [[G1163]] take Him in [[G1209]] until [[G891]] [the] time [comes] [[G5550]] for [the] restoration [[G605]] of all things, [[G3956]] which [[G3739]] God [[G2316]] announced [[G2980]] long ago [[G165]] through [[G1223]] His [[G846]] holy [[G40]] prophets. [[G4396]]

### 22
For [[G3303]] Moses [[G3475]] said, [[G2036]] ‘The [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] your [[G4771]] God [[G2316]] will raise up [[G450]] for you [[G4771]] a prophet [[G4396]] like [[G5613]] me [[G1473]] from among [[G1537]] your [[G4771]] brothers. [[G80]] You must listen to [[G191]] Him [[G846]] in [[G2596]] everything [[G3956]] He tells [[G2980]] you. [[G4771]]

### 23
Everyone [[G3956]] who [[G3748]] does not heed [[G191]] [ His words ] [[G4396]] will be completely cut off [[G1842]] from among [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] people.’ [[G2992]]

### 24
Indeed, [[G2532]] all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] prophets [[G4396]] from [[G575]] Samuel on, [[G4545]] as many as [[G3745]] have spoken, [[G2980]] have proclaimed [[G2605]] these [[G3778]] days. [[G2250]]

### 25
[And] you [[G4771]] are [[G1510]] sons [[G5207]] of the [[G3588]] prophets [[G4396]] and [[G2532]] of the [[G3588]] covenant [[G1242]] God [[G2316]] made [[G1303]] with [[G4314]] your [[G4771]] fathers, [[G3962]] [when] He said [[G3004]] to [[G4314]] Abraham, [[G11]] ‘Through [[G1722]] your [[G4771]] offspring [[G4690]] all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] families [[G3965]] of the [[G3588]] earth [[G1093]] will be blessed. [[G1757]]

### 26
[When] God [[G2316]] raised up [[G450]] His [[G846]] servant, [[G3816]] He sent [[G649]] Him [[G846]] first [[G4412]] to you [[G4771]] to bless [[G2127]] you [[G4771]] by [[G1722]] turning [[G654]] each [of you] [[G1538]] from [[G575]] your [[G4771]] wicked ways.” [[G4189]]
