### 1
In [[G2596]] the [[G3588]] church [[G1577]] at [[G1722]] Antioch [[G490]] there were [[G1510]] prophets [[G4396]] and [[G2532]] teachers: [[G1320]] Barnabas, [[G921]] Simeon [[G4826]] called [[G2564]] Niger, [[G3526]] Lucius [[G3066]] of [[G3588]] Cyrene, [[G2956]] Manaen [[G3127]] (a childhood companion [[G4939]] of Herod [[G2264]] the [[G3588]] tetrarch), [[G5076]] and [[G2532]] Saul. [[G4569]]

### 2
[While] [[G1161]] they [[G846]] were worshiping [[G3008]] the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] and [[G2532]] fasting, [[G3522]] the [[G3588]] Holy [[G40]] Spirit [[G4151]] said, [[G2036]] “Set apart [[G873]] for Me [[G1473]] Barnabas [[G921]] and [[G2532]] Saul [[G4569]] for [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] work [[G2041]] to which [[G3739]] I have called [[G4341]] them. [[G846]]

### 3
So [[G5119]] after they had fasted [[G3522]] and [[G2532]] prayed, [[G4336]] they laid [[G2007]] [their] [[G3588]] hands [[G5495]] on them [[G846]] [and] sent [them] off. [[G630]]

### 4
Then [[G3767]] [Barnabas and Saul], [[G846]] sent forth [[G1599]] by [[G5259]] the [[G3588]] Holy [[G40]] Spirit, [[G4151]] went down [[G2718]] to [[G1519]] Seleucia [[G4581]] and [[G5037]] sailed [[G636]] from there [[G1564]] to [[G1519]] Cyprus. [[G2954]]

### 5
[When] [[G2532]] they arrived [[G1096]] at [[G1722]] Salamis, [[G4529]] they proclaimed [[G2605]] the [[G3588]] word [[G3056]] of God [[G2316]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] Jewish [[G2453]] synagogues. [[G4864]] And [[G1161]] John [[G2491]] was with them [[G2192]] as their helper. [[G5257]]

### 6
They traveled through [[G1330]] the [[G3588]] whole [[G3650]] island [[G3520]] as far as [[G891]] Paphos, [[G3974]] [where] they found [[G2147]] a [[G5100]] Jewish [[G2453]] sorcerer [[G3097]] [and] false prophet [[G5578]] named [[G3686]] Bar-Jesus, [[G919]]

### 7
an attendant [[G4862]] of the [[G3588]] proconsul, [[G446]] Sergius [[G4588]] Paulus. [[G3972]] [The proconsul], [[G3778]] a man [[G435]] of intelligence, [[G4908]] summoned [[G4341]] Barnabas [[G921]] and [[G2532]] Saul [[G4569]] because he wanted [[G1934]] to hear [[G191]] the [[G3588]] word [[G3056]] of God. [[G2316]]

### 8
But [[G1161]] Elymas [[G1681]] the [[G3588]] sorcerer [[G3097]] (for [[G1063]] that is what [[G3779]] his [[G846]] name [[G3686]] means) [[G3177]] opposed [[G436]] them [[G846]] [and] tried [[G2212]] to turn [[G1294]] the [[G3588]] proconsul [[G446]] from [[G575]] the [[G3588]] faith. [[G4102]]

### 9
Then [[G1161]] Saul, [[G4569]] who [was] [[G3588]] also [called] [[G2532]] Paul, [[G3972]] filled with [[G4130]] [the] Holy [[G40]] Spirit, [[G4151]] looked directly [[G816]] at [[G1519]] Elymas [[G846]]

### 10
and said, [[G2036]] “O [[G5599]] child [[G5207]] of [the] devil [[G1228]] [and] enemy [[G2190]] of all [[G3956]] righteousness! [[G1343]] [You are] full [[G4134]] of all kinds [[G3956]] of deceit [[G1388]] and [[G2532]] trickery. [[G4468]] Will you never stop [[G3973]] perverting [[G1294]] the [[G3588]] straight [[G2117]] ways [[G3598]] of the [[G3588]] Lord? [[G2962]]

### 11
Now [[G3568]] look, [[G2400]] [the] hand [[G5495]] of the Lord [[G2962]] [is] against [[G1909]] you, [[G4771]] and [[G2532]] for [[G891]] a time [[G2540]] you will be [[G1510]] blind [and] [[G5185]] unable to see [[G991]] the [[G3588]] light of the sun.” [[G2246]] Immediately [[G3916]] mist [[G887]] and [[G2532]] darkness [[G4655]] came [[G4098]] over [[G1909]] him, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] he groped about, [[G4013]] seeking [[G2212]] someone to lead [him] by the hand. [[G5497]]

### 12
[When] [[G5119]] the [[G3588]] proconsul [[G446]] saw [[G3708]] what [[G3588]] had happened, [[G1096]] he believed, [[G4100]] for he was astonished [[G1605]] at [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] teaching [[G1322]] about the [[G3588]] Lord. [[G2962]]

### 13
After setting sail [[G321]] from [[G575]] Paphos, [[G3974]] Paul [[G3972]] [and] his companions [[G3588]] came [[G2064]] to [[G1519]] Perga [[G4011]] in Pamphylia, [[G3828]] [where] [[G1161]] John [[G2491]] left [[G672]] them [[G846]] to return [[G5290]] to [[G1519]] Jerusalem. [[G2414]]

### 14
And [[G1161]] from [[G575]] Perga, [[G4011]] they [[G846]] traveled inland [[G1330]] to [[G1519]] Pisidian [[G4099]] Antioch, [[G490]] where [[G2532]] they entered [[G1525]] the [[G3588]] synagogue [[G4864]] on the [[G3588]] Sabbath [[G4521]] [and] sat down. [[G2523]]

### 15
After [[G3326]] the [[G3588]] reading [[G320]] from the [[G3588]] Law [[G3551]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] Prophets, [[G4396]] the [[G3588]] synagogue leaders [[G752]] sent word [[G649]] to [[G4314]] them: [[G846]] “Brothers, [[G80]] if [[G1487]] you have [[G1510]] a [[G5100]] word [[G3056]] of encouragement [[G3874]] for [[G4314]] the [[G3588]] people, [[G2992]] please speak. [[G3004]]

### 16
Paul [[G3972]] stood up, [[G450]] motioned [[G2678]] with [his] [[G3588]] hand, [[G5495]] [and] began to speak: [[G2036]] “Men [[G435]] [of] Israel [[G2475]] and [[G2532]] [you Gentiles] who [[G3588]] fear [[G5399]] God, [[G2316]] listen [to me]! [[G191]]

### 17
The [[G3588]] God [[G2316]] of [[G3778]] the [[G3588]] people [[G2992]] of Israel [[G2474]] chose [[G1586]] our [[G1473]] fathers. [[G3962]] He made them into a great [[G5312]] people [[G2992]] during [[G1722]] [their] [[G3588]] stay [[G3940]] in [[G1722]] Egypt, [[G125]] and [[G2532]] with [[G3326]] an uplifted [[G5308]] arm [[G1023]] He led [[G1806]] them [[G846]] out of [[G1537]] [that land]. [[G846]]

### 18
He endured their conduct [[G5159]] for [[G5550]] about [[G5613]] forty years [[G5063]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] wilderness. [[G2048]]

### 19
And [[G2532]] having vanquished [[G2507]] seven [[G2033]] nations [[G1484]] in [[G1722]] Canaan, [[G5477]] {He gave} their [[G846]] land [[G1093]] [to His people] as an inheritance. [[G2624]]

### 20
[All this took about] [[G5613]] 450 {} [[G5071]] years. [[G2094]] After [[G3326]] this, [[G3778]] [God] gave [them] [[G1325]] judges [[G2923]] until the time [[G2193]] of Samuel [[G4545]] the [[G3588]] prophet. [[G4396]]

### 21
Then [[G2547]] [the people] asked for [[G154]] a king, [[G935]] and [[G2532]] God [[G2316]] gave [[G1325]] them [[G846]] forty [[G5062]] years [[G2094]] [under] Saul [[G4549]] son [[G5207]] of Kish, [[G2797]] from [[G1537]] [the] tribe [[G5443]] of Benjamin. [[G958]]

### 22
[After] [[G2532]] removing [[G3179]] [Saul], [[G846]] He raised up [[G1453]] David [[G1138]] as [[G1519]] their [[G846]] king [[G935]] and [[G2532]] testified [[G3140]] [about him]: [[G3739]] ‘I have found [[G2147]] David [[G1138]] [son] [[G3588]] of Jesse [[G2421]] a man [[G435]] after [[G2596]] My [[G1473]] [own] [[G3588]] heart; [[G2588]] [he] [[G3739]] will carry out [[G4160]] My [[G1473]] will [[G2307]] in its entirety. [[G3956]]

### 23
From [[G575]] the [[G3588]] descendants [[G4690]] of this [man], [[G3778]] God [[G2316]] has brought [[G71]] to Israel [[G2474]] [the] Savior [[G4990]] Jesus, [[G2424]] as [[G2596]] He promised. [[G1860]]

### 24
Before [[G4253]] the [[G3588]] arrival [[G1529]] of [Jesus], [[G846]] John [[G2491]] preached [[G4296]] a baptism [[G908]] of repentance [[G3341]] to all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] people [[G2992]] of Israel. [[G2474]]

### 25
As [[G5613]] John [[G2491]] was completing [[G4137]] [his] [[G3588]] course, [[G1408]] he said, [[G2036]] ‘Who [[G5101]] do you suppose [[G5282]] I [[G1473]] am? [[G1510]] I [[G1473]] am [[G1510]] not [that One]. [[G3756]] But [[G235]] He is coming [[G2064]] after [[G3326]] me [[G1473]] whose [[G3739]] sandals [[G5266]] I am [[G1510]] not [[G3756]] worthy [[G514]] to untie. [[G3089]]

### 26
Brothers, [[G80]] children [[G5207]] of Abraham, [[G11]] and [[G2532]] you [ Gentiles ] who [[G4771]] fear [[G5399]] God, [[G2316]] [it is] to us [[G1473]] [that] [[G3588]] this [[G3778]] message [[G3056]] of [[G3588]] salvation [[G4991]] has been sent. [[G1821]]

### 27
The [[G3588]] [people] [[G2730]] of [[G1722]] Jerusalem [[G2419]] and [[G2532]] their [[G846]] rulers [[G758]] did not recognize [[G50]] [Jesus], [[G3778]] yet [[G2532]] in condemning [Him] [[G2919]] they fulfilled [[G4137]] the [[G3588]] words [[G5456]] of the [[G3588]] prophets [[G4396]] that [[G3588]] are read [[G314]] every [[G3956]] Sabbath. [[G4521]]

### 28
And [[G2532]] though they found [[G2147]] no [[G3367]] ground [[G156]] for a death sentence, [[G2288]] they asked [[G154]] Pilate [[G4091]] to have Him executed. [[G337]]

### 29
When [[G5613]] they had carried out [[G5055]] all [[G3956]] that [[G3588]] was written [[G1125]] about [[G4012]] Him, [[G846]] they took [Him] down [[G2507]] from [[G575]] the [[G3588]] tree [[G3586]] [and] laid [Him] [[G5087]] in [[G1519]] a tomb. [[G3419]]

### 30
But [[G1161]] God [[G2316]] raised [[G1453]] Him [[G846]] from [[G1537]] [the] dead, [[G3498]]

### 31
[and] for [[G1909]] many [[G4119]] days [[G2250]] [He] [[G3739]] appeared [[G3708]] to those who [[G3588]] had accompanied [[G4872]] Him [[G846]] from [[G575]] Galilee [[G1056]] to [[G1519]] Jerusalem. [[G2419]] [They] [[G3748]] are [[G1510]] now [[G3568]] His [[G846]] witnesses [[G3144]] to [[G4314]] [our] [[G3588]] people. [[G2992]]

### 32
And now [[G2532]] we [[G1473]] proclaim to you the good news: [[G2097]] [What God] promised [[G1860]] [our] [[G3588]] fathers [[G3962]]

### 33
[He] [[G2316]] has fulfilled [[G1603]] for [[G3588]] us, [[G1473]] their [[G846]] children, [[G5043]] by raising up Jesus. [[G450]] As [[G5613]] it is written [[G1125]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] second [[G1208]] Psalm: [[G5568]] ‘You [[G4771]] are [[G1510]] My [[G1473]] Son; [[G5207]] today [[G4594]] I [[G1473]] have become Your Father. [[G1080]]

### 34
In fact, [[G3754]] [God] raised [[G450]] Him [[G846]] from [[G1537]] [the] dead [[G3498]] never [[G3371]] to see [[G3195]] decay. [[G1312]] As He has said: [[G2046]] ‘I will give [[G1325]] you [[G4771]] the [[G3588]] holy [and] [[G3741]] sure [blessings] [[G4103]] [I promised to] David.’ [[G1138]]

### 35
So [[G1360]] also, [[G2532]] He says [[G3004]] in [[G1722]] another [Psalm]: [[G2087]] ‘You will not let [[G1325]] your [[G4771]] Holy One [[G3741]] see [[G3708]] decay.’ [[G1312]]

### 36
For [[G1063]] [when] David [[G1138]] had served [[G5256]] God’s [[G2316]] purpose [[G1012]] in his own [[G2398]] generation, [[G1074]] he fell asleep. [[G2837]] [His body] was buried [[G4369]] with [[G4314]] his [[G846]] fathers [[G3962]] and [[G2532]] saw [[G3708]] decay. [[G1312]]

### 37
But [[G1161]] the [One] [[G3739]] whom [[G3588]] God [[G2316]] raised from the dead [[G1453]] did not see [[G3708]] decay. [[G1312]]

### 38
Therefore [[G3767]] let it be [[G1510]] known [[G1110]] to you, [[G4771]] brothers, [[G80]] that [[G3754]] through [[G1223]] [Jesus] [[G3778]] [the] forgiveness [[G859]] of sins [[G266]] is proclaimed [[G2605]] to you. [[G4771]]

### 39
Through [[G1722]] Him [[G3778]] everyone [[G3956]] who [[G3588]] believes [[G4100]] is justified [[G1344]] from [[G575]] everything [[G3956]] you could not [[G1410]] be justified [[G1344]] from [[G3739]] by [[G1722]] [the] Law [[G3551]] of Moses. [[G3475]]

### 40
Watch out, [[G991]] then, [[G3767]] that [[G3588]] what was spoken [[G2046]] by [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] prophets [[G4396]] does not happen [to you]: [[G1904]]

### 41
‘Look, [[G3708]] [you] [[G3588]] scoffers, [[G2707]] wonder [[G2296]] and [[G2532]] perish; [[G853]] for [[G3754]] I [[G1473]] am doing [[G2038]] a work [[G2041]] in [[G1722]] your [[G4771]] days [[G2250]] [that] [[G2041]] you would never believe, [[G4100]] even if [[G1437]] someone [[G5100]] told [[G1555]] you.’” [[G4771]]

### 42
[As] [[G1161]] [Paul and Barnabas] [[G846]] were leaving [the synagogue], [[G1826]] [the people] urged [[G3870]] them [[G846]] to continue [[G2980]] this [[G3778]] message [[G4487]] on [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] next [[G3342]] Sabbath. [[G4521]]

### 43
[After] [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] synagogue [[G4864]] was dismissed, [[G3089]] many [[G4183]] of the [[G3588]] Jews [[G2453]] and [[G2532]] devout [[G4576]] converts to Judaism [[G4339]] followed [[G190]] Paul [[G3972]] and [[G2532]] Barnabas, [[G921]] who [[G3748]] spoke [[G4354]] to them [[G846]] [and] urged [[G3982]] them [[G846]] to continue [[G4357]] in the [[G3588]] grace [[G5485]] of God. [[G2316]]

### 44
On the [[G3588]] following [[G2064]] Sabbath, [[G4521]] nearly [[G4975]] the [[G3588]] whole [[G3956]] city [[G4172]] gathered [[G4863]] to hear [[G191]] the [[G3588]] word [[G3056]] of [the] Lord. [[G2962]]

### 45
But [when] [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] Jews [[G2453]] saw [[G3708]] the [[G3588]] crowds, [[G3793]] they were filled [[G4130]] with jealousy, [[G2205]] and [[G2532]] {they} blasphemously [[G987]] contradicted [[G483]] what [[G3588]] Paul [[G3972]] was saying. [[G2980]]

### 46
Then [[G5037]] Paul [[G3972]] and [[G2532]] Barnabas [[G921]] answered [them] boldly: [[G3955]] “It was [[G1510]] necessary [[G316]] to speak [[G2980]] the [[G3588]] word [[G3056]] of God [[G2316]] to you [[G4771]] first. [[G4412]] But since [[G1894]] you reject [[G683]] it [[G846]] and [[G2532]] do not consider [[G2919]] yourselves [[G1438]] worthy [[G514]] of eternal [[G166]] life, [[G2222]] we now turn [[G4762]] to [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] Gentiles. [[G1484]]

### 47
For [[G1063]] this is what [[G3779]] the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] has commanded [[G1781]] us: [[G1473]] ‘I have made [[G5087]] you [[G4771]] a light [[G5457]] for [the] Gentiles, [[G1484]] to bring [[G1510]] salvation [[G4991]] to [[G2193]] [the] ends [[G2078]] of the [[G3588]] earth.’” [[G1093]]

### 48
[When] [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] Gentiles [[G1484]] heard [this], [[G191]] they rejoiced [[G5463]] and [[G2532]] glorified [[G1392]] the [[G3588]] word [[G3056]] of the [[G3588]] Lord, [[G2962]] and [[G2532]] all who [[G3745]] were [[G1510]] appointed [[G5021]] for [[G1519]] eternal [[G166]] life [[G2222]] believed. [[G4100]]

### 49
And [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] word [[G3056]] of the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] spread [[G1308]] throughout [[G1223]] [that] [[G3588]] region. [[G5561]]

### 50
The [[G3588]] Jews, [[G2453]] however, [[G1161]] incited [[G3951]] the [[G3588]] religious [[G4576]] women [[G1135]] of prominence [[G2158]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] leading men [[G4413]] of the [[G3588]] city. [[G4172]] They stirred up [[G1892]] persecution [[G1375]] against [[G1909]] Paul [[G3972]] and [[G2532]] Barnabas [[G921]] and [[G2532]] drove them out [[G1544]] of [[G575]] their [[G846]] district. [[G3725]]

### 51
[So] [[G1161]] they shook [[G1621]] the [[G3588]] dust [[G2868]] {off} [their] [[G3588]] feet [[G4228]] [in protest] against [[G1909]] them [[G846]] [and] went [[G2064]] to [[G1519]] Iconium. [[G2430]]

### 52
And [[G5037]] the [[G3588]] disciples [[G3101]] were filled [[G4137]] with joy [[G5479]] and [[G2532]] [with the] Holy [[G40]] Spirit. [[G4151]]
