###### 1
About [[G2596]] that [[G1565]] time, [[G2540]] King [[G935]] Herod [[G2264]] reached out [[G1911]] to inflict harm on [[G2559]] some [[G5100]] who [[G3588]] belonged to [[G575]] the [[G3588]] church. [[G1577]]

###### 2
{He had} James, [[G2385]] the [[G3588]] brother [[G80]] of John, [[G2491]] put to death [[G337]] with the sword. [[G3162]]

###### 3
Seeing [[G3708]] that [[G3754]] [this] [[G1510]] pleased [[G701]] the [[G3588]] Jews, [[G2453]] he proceeded [[G4369]] to seize [[G4815]] Peter [[G4074]] during [[G1510]] the [[G3588]] Feast of Unleavened [Bread]. [[G106]]

###### 4
He arrested [[G4084]] [him] [[G3739]] and [[G2532]] put [him] [[G5087]] in [[G1519]] prison, [[G5438]] handing [him] over [[G3860]] to be guarded [[G5442]] by four [[G5064]] squads of four [[G5069]] soldiers [each]. [[G4757]] [Herod] intended [[G1014]] to bring him out [[G321]] to the [[G3588]] people [[G2992]] after [[G3326]] the [[G3588]] Passover. [[G3957]]

###### 5
So [[G3767]] Peter [[G4074]] was kept [[G5083]] in [[G1722]] prison, [[G5438]] but [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] church [[G1577]] was [[G1510]] fervently [[G1619]] praying [[G4335]] to [[G4314]] God [[G2316]] for [[G4012]] him. [[G846]]

###### 6
On [[G3588]] [the] [[G1565]] night [[G3571]] [before] [[G3753]] Herod [[G2264]] was [[G3195]] to bring him [to trial], [[G4254]] Peter [[G4074]] was [[G1510]] sleeping [[G2837]] between [[G3342]] two [[G1417]] soldiers, [[G4757]] bound [[G1210]] with two [[G1417]] chains, [[G254]] with [[G5037]] sentries [[G5441]] standing guard [[G5083]] at [[G4253]] the [[G3588]] entrance [[G2374]] to the [[G3588]] prison. [[G5438]]

###### 7
Suddenly [[G2532]] an angel [[G32]] of [the] Lord [[G2962]] appeared [[G2186]] and [[G2532]] a light [[G5457]] shone [[G2989]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] cell. [[G3612]] He tapped [[G3960]] Peter [[G4074]] on the [[G3588]] side [[G4125]] [and] woke him up, [[G1453]] saying, [[G3004]] “Get up [[G450]] quickly.” [[G5034]] And [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] chains [[G254]] fell [[G1601]] off [[G1537]] [his] [[G3588]] wrists. [[G5495]]

###### 8
“Get dressed [[G2224]] and [[G2532]] put on [[G5265]] your [[G4771]] sandals,” [[G4547]] said [[G2036]] the [[G3588]] angel. [[G32]] Peter did [[G4160]] so, [[G3779]] and [[G2532]] [the angel] told [[G3004]] him, [[G846]] “Wrap [[G4016]] your [[G4771]] cloak {around you} [[G2440]] and [[G2532]] follow [[G190]] me.” [[G1473]]

###### 9
[So] [[G2532]] [Peter] followed him [[G190]] out, [[G1831]] [but] [[G2532]] he was unaware [[G1492]] that [[G3754]] what [[G3588]] the [[G3588]] angel [[G32]] was doing [[G1096]] was [[G1510]] real. [[G227]] He only thought [[G1380]] he was seeing [[G991]] a vision. [[G3705]]

###### 10
They passed [[G1330]] [the] first [[G4413]] and [[G2532]] second [[G1208]] guards [[G5438]] [and] came [[G2064]] to [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] iron [[G4603]] gate [[G4439]] leading [[G5342]] to [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] city, [[G4172]] which [[G3748]] opened [[G455]] for them [[G846]] by itself. [[G844]] [When] [[G2532]] they had gone outside [[G1831]] [and] walked the length of [[G4281]] one [[G1520]] block, [[G4505]] the [[G3588]] angel [[G32]] suddenly [[G2112]] left [[G868]] him. [[G846]]

###### 11
Then [[G2532]] Peter [[G4074]] came [[G1096]] to [[G1722]] himself [[G1438]] [and] said, [[G2036]] “Now [[G3568]] I know [[G1492]] for sure [[G230]] that [[G3754]] the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] has sent [[G1821]] His [[G846]] angel [[G32]] and [[G2532]] rescued [[G1807]] me [[G1473]] from [[G1537]] Herod’s [[G2264]] grasp [[G5495]] and [[G2532]] [from] everything [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] Jewish [[G2453]] people [[G2992]] were anticipating. [[G4329]]

###### 12
And [when] [[G5037]] he had realized [this], [[G4894]] he went [[G2064]] to [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] house [[G3614]] of [[G3588]] Mary [[G3137]] the [[G3588]] mother [[G3384]] of John, [[G2491]] [also] [[G3588]] called [[G1941]] Mark, [[G3138]] where [[G3757]] many [people] [[G2425]] were [[G1510]] gathered together [[G4867]] praying. [[G4336]]

###### 13
He [[G846]] knocked [[G2925]] [at] the [[G3588]] outer gate, [[G4440]] [and] a servant girl [[G3814]] named [[G3686]] Rhoda [[G4498]] came [[G4334]] to answer [it]. [[G5219]]

###### 14
When she recognized [[G1921]] Peter’s [[G4074]] voice, [[G5456]] she was so overjoyed [[G5479]] [that] [[G2532]] she forgot to open [[G455]] the [[G3588]] gate, [[G4440]] but [[G1161]] ran inside [[G1532]] [and] announced, [[G518]] “Peter [[G4074]] is standing [[G2476]] at [[G4253]] the [[G3588]] gate!” [[G4440]]

###### 15
“You are out of your mind,” [[G3105]] they told [[G2036]] her. [[G846]] But [when] [[G1161]] she kept insisting [[G1340]] [it] was [[G2192]] so, [[G3779]] they said, [[G2036]] “It is [[G1510]] his [[G846]] angel.” [[G32]]

###### 16
But [[G1161]] Peter [[G4074]] kept on [[G1961]] knocking, [[G2925]] and [[G1161]] [when] they opened [the door], [[G455]] they saw [[G3708]] him [[G846]] and [[G2532]] were amazed. [[G1839]]

###### 17
[Peter] motioned [[G2678]] with [his] [[G3588]] hand [[G5495]] for [[G846]] silence, [[G4601]] [and] he described [[G1334]] how [[G4459]] the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] had brought [[G1806]] him [[G846]] out of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] prison. [[G5438]] “Send word [[G518]] to James [[G2385]] and [[G2532]] to the [[G3588]] brothers,” [[G80]] he said, [[G2036]] and [[G2532]] he left for [[G1831]] another [[G2087]] place. [[G5117]]

###### 18
At [[G1161]] daybreak [[G2250]] there was [[G1510]] no [[G3756]] small [[G3641]] commotion [[G5017]] among [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] soldiers [[G4757]] as to what [[G5101]] had become [of] [[G1096]] Peter. [[G4074]]

###### 19
[After] [[G1161]] Herod [[G2264]] had searched [[G1934]] for him [[G846]] [unsuccessfully], [[G2147]] he examined [[G350]] the [[G3588]] guards [[G5441]] [and] ordered that [[G2753]] they be executed. [[G520]] Then [[G2532]] he went down [[G2718]] from [[G575]] Judea [[G2449]] to [[G1519]] Caesarea [[G2542]] [and] spent some time [there]. [[G1304]]

###### 20
Now [[G1161]] [Herod] had become [[G1510]] infuriated [[G2371]] [with the] people of Tyre [[G5183]] and [[G2532]] Sidon, [[G4606]] and [[G1161]] they convened [[G3661]] before [[G4314]] him. [[G846]] Having secured the support [[G3982]] of Blastus, [[G986]] the [[G3588]] king’s [[G935]] chamberlain, [[G2846]] they asked for [[G154]] peace, [[G1515]] because [[G1223]] their [[G846]] region [[G5561]] depended [[G575]] on the [[G3588]] king’s [country] [[G937]] for food. [[G5142]]

###### 21
On the appointed [[G5002]] day, [[G2250]] Herod [[G2264]] donned [[G1746]] [his] royal [[G937]] [robes], [[G2066]] sat [[G2523]] on [[G1909]] [his] [[G3588]] throne, [[G968]] [and] addressed [[G1215]] [the people]. [[G846]]

###### 22
And [[G1161]] [they] [[G1218]] began to shout, [[G2019]] “[This is the] voice [[G5456]] of a god, [[G2316]] not [[G3756]] a man!” [[G444]]

###### 23
Immediately, [[G3916]] because [[G473]] [Herod] did not give [[G1325]] glory [[G1391]] to God, [[G2316]] an angel [[G32]] of [the] Lord [[G2962]] struck [[G3960]] him {down}, [[G846]] and [[G2532]] he was [[G1096]] eaten by worms [[G4662]] [and] died. [[G1634]]

###### 24
But [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] word [[G3056]] of God [[G2316]] continued to spread [[G837]] and [[G2532]] multiply. [[G4129]]

###### 25
[When] [[G1161]] Barnabas [[G921]] and [[G2532]] Saul [[G4569]] had fulfilled [[G4137]] [their] [[G3588]] mission [[G1248]] to [[G1519]] Jerusalem, [[G2419]] they returned, [[G5290]] bringing with [them] [[G4838]] John, [[G2491]] [also] [[G3588]] called [[G1941]] Mark. [[G3138]]
