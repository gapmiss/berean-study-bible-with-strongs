### 1
While [[G1722]] Apollos [[G625]] was [[G1510]] at [[G1722]] Corinth, [[G2882]] Paul [[G3972]] passed through [[G1330]] the [[G3588]] interior [[G510]] [and] came [[G2064]] to [[G1519]] Ephesus. [[G2181]] [There] [[G2532]] he found [[G2147]] some [[G5100]] disciples [[G3101]]

### 2
and [[G5037]] asked [[G2036]] them, [[G846]] “Did you receive [[G2983]] [the] Holy [[G40]] Spirit [[G4151]] when you became believers?” [[G4100]] “No,” [[G235]] [they answered], [[G1161]] “we have not even heard [[G191]] that [[G1487]] there is [[G1510]] [a] Holy [[G40]] Spirit.” [[G4151]]

### 3
“Into [[G1519]] what, [[G5101]] then, [[G3767]] were you baptized?” [[G907]] [Paul] asked. [[G2036]] “The [[G3588]] baptism [[G908]] of John,” [[G2491]] they replied. [[G2036]]

### 4
Paul [[G3972]] explained: [[G2036]] “John’s [[G2491]] baptism was [[G907]] a baptism [[G908]] of repentance. [[G3341]] He told [[G3004]] the [[G3588]] people [[G2992]] to [[G2443]] believe [[G4100]] in [[G1519]] the [One] [[G3588]] coming [[G2064]] after [[G3326]] him, [[G846]] that [[G3778]] is, [[G1510]] in [[G1519]] Jesus.” [[G2424]]

### 5
On hearing this, [[G191]] they were baptized [[G907]] in [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] name [[G3686]] of the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] Jesus. [[G2424]]

### 6
And [when] [[G2532]] Paul [[G3972]] laid [[G2007]] [his] [[G3588]] hands [[G5495]] on them, [[G846]] the [[G3588]] Holy [[G40]] Spirit [[G4151]] came [[G2064]] upon [[G1909]] them, [[G846]] and [[G5037]] they spoke [[G2980]] in tongues [[G1100]] and [[G2532]] prophesied. [[G4395]]

### 7
There were [[G1510]] about [[G5616]] twelve [[G1427]] men [[G435]] in all. [[G3956]]

### 8
Then [[G1161]] [Paul] went [[G1525]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] synagogue [[G4864]] [and] spoke boldly [there] [[G3955]] for [[G1909]] three [[G5140]] months, [[G3376]] arguing [[G1256]] persuasively [[G3982]] about [[G4012]] the [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] of God. [[G2316]]

### 9
But [[G1161]] when [[G5613]] some of them [[G5100]] stubbornly [[G4645]] refused to believe [[G544]] [and] publicly [[G4128]] maligned [[G2551]] the [[G3588]] Way, [[G3598]] [Paul] took [[G873]] [his] [[G3588]] disciples [[G3101]] [and] left [[G868]] [the synagogue] [[G846]] to conduct daily discussions [[G1256]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] lecture hall [[G4981]] of Tyrannus. [[G5181]]

### 10
This [[G3778]] continued [[G1096]] for [[G1909]] two [[G1417]] years, [[G2094]] so that [[G5620]] everyone [[G3956]] who [[G3588]] lived [[G2730]] in [[G3588]] [the province of] Asia, [[G773]] Jews [[G2453]] and [[G2532]] Greeks [[G1672]] alike, [[G5037]] heard [[G191]] the [[G3588]] word [[G3056]] of the [[G3588]] Lord. [[G2962]]

### 11
God [[G2316]] did [[G4160]] extraordinary [[G5177]] miracles [[G1411]] through [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] hands [[G5495]] of Paul, [[G3972]]

### 12
so that [[G5620]] even [[G2532]] handkerchiefs [[G4676]] and [[G2228]] aprons [[G4612]] that had touched him [[G5559]] were taken [[G667]] to [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] sick, [[G770]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] diseases [[G3554]] and [[G5037]] evil [[G4190]] spirits [[G4151]] left [[G1607]] them. [[G846]]

### 13
Now [[G1161]] [there were] some [[G5100]] itinerant [[G4022]] Jewish [[G2453]] exorcists [[G1845]] who tried [[G2021]] to invoke [[G3687]] the [[G3588]] name [[G3686]] of the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] Jesus [[G2424]] over [[G1909]] those [[G3588]] with [[G2192]] evil [[G4190]] spirits. [[G4151]] They would say, [[G3004]] “I bind [[G3726]] you [[G4771]] [by] [[G3588]] Jesus, [[G2424]] whom [[G3739]] Paul [[G3972]] proclaims. [[G2784]]

### 14
Seven [[G2033]] sons [[G5207]] of Sceva, [[G4630]] a Jewish [[G2453]] chief priest, [[G749]] were [[G1510]] doing [[G4160]] this. [[G3778]]

### 15
Eventually, [[G1161]] [one of] the [[G3588]] evil [[G4190]] spirits [[G4151]] answered [[G611]] them, [[G846]] “Jesus [[G2424]] I know, [[G1097]] and [[G2532]] I know about [[G1987]] Paul, [[G3972]] but [[G1161]] you, [[G4771]] who [[G5101]] are you?” [[G1510]]

### 16
Then [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] man [[G444]] with [[G3739]] the [[G3588]] evil [[G4190]] spirit [[G4151]] jumped [[G2177]] on [[G1909]] them [[G846]] [and] overpowered [[G2634]] them all. [[G297]] The attack [[G2480]] was so violent [[G5620]] that they ran [[G1628]] out of [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] house, [[G3624]] naked [[G1131]] and [[G2532]] wounded. [[G5135]]

### 17
This [[G3778]] became [[G1096]] known [[G1110]] to all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] Jews [[G2453]] and [[G2532]] Greeks [[G1672]] living [[G2730]] in Ephesus, [[G2181]] and [[G2532]] fear [[G5401]] came [[G1968]] over [[G1909]] all [[G3956]] of them. [[G846]] [So] [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] name [[G3686]] of the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] Jesus [[G2424]] was held in high honor. [[G3170]]

### 18
Many [[G4183]] who [[G3588]] had believed [[G4100]] now [[G5037]] came forward, [[G2064]] confessing [[G1843]] and [[G2532]] disclosing [[G312]] their [[G846]] deeds. [[G4234]]

### 19
And [[G1161]] a number [[G2425]] of those who [[G3588]] had practiced [[G4238]] magic arts [[G4021]] brought [[G4851]] [their] [[G3588]] books [[G976]] [and] burned [them] [[G2618]] in front of [[G1799]] everyone. [[G3956]] [When] [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] value [[G5092]] of [the books] [[G846]] was calculated, [[G4860]] [it came to] [[G2147]] fifty thousand [[G4002]] drachmas. [[G694]]

### 20
So [[G3779]] the [[G3588]] word [[G3056]] of the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] powerfully [[G2904]] continued to spread [[G837]] and [[G2532]] prevail. [[G2480]]

### 21
After [[G5613]] these things [[G3778]] had happened, [[G4137]] Paul [[G3972]] purposed [[G5087]] in [[G1722]] spirit [[G4151]] to go [[G4198]] to [[G1519]] Jerusalem [[G2414]] after he had passed through [[G1330]] Macedonia [[G3109]] and [[G2532]] Achaia. [[G882]] “After [[G3326]] I [[G1473]] have been [[G1096]] there,” [[G1563]] he said, [[G2036]] “I [[G1473]] must [[G1163]] see [[G3708]] Rome [[G4516]] as well.” [[G2532]]

### 22
He sent [[G649]] two [[G1417]] of [[G3588]] his [[G846]] helpers, [[G1247]] Timothy [[G5095]] and [[G2532]] Erastus, [[G2037]] to [[G1519]] Macedonia, [[G3109]] [while] he [[G846]] stayed [[G1907]] for a time [[G5550]] in [[G1519]] [the province of] Asia. [[G773]]

### 23
About [[G2596]] that [[G1565]] time [[G2540]] a great [[G3641]] disturbance [[G5017]] arose [[G1096]] about [[G4012]] the [[G3588]] Way. [[G3598]]

### 24
[ It began with] [[G1063]] a [[G5100]] silversmith [[G695]] named [[G3686]] Demetrius, [[G1216]] who had brought [[G3930]] much [[G3641]] business [[G2039]] to the [[G3588]] craftsmen [[G5079]] making [[G4160]] silver [[G693]] shrines [[G3485]] of Artemis. [[G735]]

### 25
[Demetrius] assembled [the craftsmen], [[G4867]] along with [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] workmen [[G2040]] in [[G4012]] related [[G3588]] trades. [[G5108]] “Men,” [[G435]] he said, [[G2036]] “you know [[G1987]] that [[G3754]] this [[G3778]] business [[G2039]] is [[G1510]] our [[G1473]] [source of] [[G3588]] prosperity. [[G2142]]

### 26
And [[G2532]] [as] you see [[G2334]] and [[G2532]] hear, [[G191]] not [[G3756]] only [[G3440]] in Ephesus, [[G2181]] but in [[G235]] nearly [[G4975]] the whole [[G3956]] [province of] Asia, [[G773]] Paul [[G3972]] has persuaded [[G3982]] a great number [[G2425]] of people [[G3793]] to turn away. [[G3179]] He says [[G3004]] that [[G3754]] man-made [gods] [[G1096]] are [[G1510]] no [[G3756]] gods [at all]. [[G2316]]

### 27
[There is] danger [[G2793]] not [[G3756]] only [[G3440]] [that] [[G3778]] our [[G1473]] business [[G3313]] will fall [[G2064]] into [[G1519]] disrepute, [[G557]] but [[G235]] also [that] [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] temple [[G2411]] of the [[G3588]] great [[G3173]] goddess [[G2299]] Artemis [[G735]] will be discredited [[G3049]] and [[G5037]] her [[G846]] majesty [[G3168]] deposed [[G2507]] [she] who [[G3739]] is worshiped [[G4576]] by all [[G3650]] [ the province of ] Asia [[G773]] and [[G2532]] the [whole] [[G3588]] world. [[G3625]]

### 28
[When] [[G1161]] [the men] heard [this], [[G191]] they were [[G1096]] enraged [[G2372]] [and] began shouting, [[G2896]] “Great [is] [[G3173]] Artemis [[G735]] of [the] Ephesians!” [[G2180]]

### 29
[Soon] [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] whole [[G3588]] city [[G4172]] was in disarray. [[G4799]] They rushed [[G3729]] together [[G3661]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] theatre, [[G2302]] dragging with [them] [[G4884]] Gaius [[G1050]] and [[G2532]] Aristarchus, [[G708]] Paul’s [[G3972]] traveling companions [[G4898]] from Macedonia. [[G3110]]

### 30
Paul [[G3972]] wanted [[G1014]] to go before [[G1525]] the [[G3588]] assembly, [[G1218]] [but] the [[G3588]] disciples [[G3101]] would not allow [[G1439]] him. [[G846]]

### 31
Even [[G2532]] some [[G5100]] of [[G3588]] [Paul’s] [[G846]] friends [[G5384]] who were [[G1510]] officials of the province of Asia [[G775]] sent word [[G3992]] to him, [[G4314]] begging [[G3870]] him [[G846]] not [[G3361]] to venture [[G1325]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] theatre. [[G2302]]

### 32
Meanwhile [[G3767]] the [[G3588]] assembly [[G1577]] was [[G1510]] in turmoil. [[G4797]] Some [[G243]] were shouting [[G2896]] one thing [[G5100]] [and some another], [[G243]] and [[G2532]] most [of them] [[G4119]] did not [even] know [[G1492]] why [[G5101]] they were there. [[G4905]]

### 33
The [[G3588]] Jews [[G2453]] in [[G1537]] the [[G3588]] crowd [[G3793]] pushed [[G4261]] Alexander [[G223]] {forward} to explain himself, [[G4822]] and [[G1161]] [he] [[G223]] motioned for silence [[G2678]] so he [[G2309]] could make [his] defense [[G626]] to the [[G3588]] people. [[G1218]]

### 34
But [[G1161]] when they realized [[G1921]] that [[G3754]] he was [[G1510]] a Jew, [[G2453]] they all shouted in unison [[G5456]] for [[G1909]] about [[G5613]] two [[G1417]] hours: [[G5610]] “Great [is] [[G3173]] Artemis [[G735]] of [the] Ephesians!” [[G2180]]

### 35
Finally [[G1161]] the [[G3588]] city clerk [[G1122]] quieted [[G2687]] the [[G3588]] crowd [[G3793]] [and] declared, [[G5346]] “Men [[G435]] [of] Ephesus, [[G2180]] doesn’t [[G3756]] [everyone] [[G444]] know [[G1097]] that [[G5101]] the [[G3588]] city [[G4172]] of Ephesus [[G2180]] is [[G1510]] guardian of the temple [[G3511]] of the [[G3588]] great [[G3173]] Artemis [[G735]] and [[G2532]] of [her image], [[G3588]] which fell from heaven? [[G1356]]

### 36
Since [[G3767]] these things [[G3778]] are [[G1510]] undeniable, [[G368]] you [[G4771]] ought [[G1163]] to be [[G5225]] calm [[G2687]] and [[G2532]] not do anything [[G4238]] rash. [[G4312]]

### 37
For [[G1063]] you have brought [[G71]] these [[G3778]] men {here}, [[G435]] [though they have] neither [[G3777]] robbed [our] temple [[G2417]] nor [[G3777]] blasphemed [[G987]] our [[G1473]] goddess. [[G2316]]

### 38
So [[G3767]] if [[G1487]] Demetrius [[G1216]] and [[G2532]] his fellow [[G846]] craftsmen [[G5079]] have [[G2192]] a complaint [[G3056]] against [[G4314]] anyone, [[G5100]] [the] courts [[G60]] are open [[G71]] and [[G2532]] proconsuls [[G446]] are available. [[G1510]] Let them bring charges against [[G1458]] one another [ there ]. [[G240]]

### 39
But [[G1161]] if [[G1487]] you are seeking [[G1934]] anything [[G5100]] beyond this, [[G4008]] it must be settled [[G1956]] in [[G1722]] a [[G3588]] legal [[G1772]] assembly. [[G1577]]

### 40
For [[G2532]] we are in jeopardy of [[G2793]] being charged [[G1458]] with rioting [[G4714]] for [[G4012]] today’s [events], [[G4594]] [and] we have [[G1410]] no [[G3367]] justification [[G159]] to account [[G3056]] for [[G4012]] this [[G3778]] commotion.” [[G4963]]

### 41
[After] [[G2532]] he had said [[G2036]] [this], [[G3778]] he dismissed [[G630]] the [[G3588]] assembly. [[G1577]]
