### 1
In my [[G3588]] first [[G4413]] book, [[G3056]] O [[G5599]] Theophilus, [[G2321]] I wrote [[G4160]] about [[G4012]] all [[G3956]] that [[G3739]] Jesus [[G2424]] began [[G756]] to do [[G4160]] and [[G2532]] to teach, [[G1321]]

### 2
until [[G891]] the [[G3739]] day [[G2250]] He was taken up [to heaven], [[G353]] after giving instructions [[G1781]] through [[G1223]] [the] Holy [[G40]] Spirit [[G4151]] to the [[G3588]] apostles [[G652]] He had chosen. [[G1586]]

### 3
After [[G3326]] His [[G846]] suffering, [[G3958]] He presented [[G3936]] Himself [[G1438]] to [them] [[G3739]] with [[G1722]] many [[G4183]] convincing proofs [[G5039]] [that] He was alive. [[G2198]] He appeared [[G3700]] to them [[G846]] over [a span ] [[G1223]] of forty [[G5062]] days [[G2250]] and [[G2532]] spoke [[G3004]] about [[G4012]] the [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] of God. [[G2316]]

### 4
And [[G2532]] when they were gathered together, [[G4871]] He commanded [[G3853]] them: [[G846]] “Do not leave [[G5563]] Jerusalem, [[G2414]] but [[G235]] wait for [[G4037]] the [gift] [[G3588]] the [[G3588]] Father [[G3962]] promised, [[G1860]] which [[G3739]] you have heard [[G191]] Me [ discuss ]. [[G1473]]

### 5
For [[G3754]] John [[G2491]] baptized [[G907]] with water, [[G5204]] but [[G1161]] in a few [[G4183]] days [[G2250]] you [[G4771]] will be baptized [[G907]] with [[G1722]] [the] Holy [[G40]] Spirit.” [[G4151]]

### 6
So [[G3767]] [when] they [[G3588]] came together, [[G4905]] they asked [[G2065]] Him, [[G846]] “Lord, [[G2962]] {will You} at [[G1722]] this [[G3778]] time [[G5550]] restore [[G600]] the [[G3588]] kingdom [[G932]] to Israel?” [[G2474]]

### 7
[Jesus] replied, [[G2036]] “It is [[G1510]] not [[G3756]] for you [[G4771]] to know [[G1097]] times [[G5550]] or [[G2228]] seasons [[G2540]] that [[G3739]] the [[G3588]] Father [[G3962]] has fixed [[G5087]] by [[G1722]] His own [[G2398]] authority. [[G1849]]

### 8
But [[G235]] you will receive [[G2983]] power [[G1411]] [when] the [[G3588]] Holy [[G40]] Spirit [[G4151]] comes [[G1904]] upon [[G1909]] you, [[G4771]] and [[G2532]] you will be [[G1510]] My [[G1473]] witnesses [[G3144]] in [[G1722]] Jerusalem, [[G2419]] and [[G2532]] in [[G1722]] all [[G3956]] Judea [[G2449]] and [[G2532]] Samaria, [[G4540]] and [[G2532]] to [[G2193]] [the] ends [[G2078]] of the [[G3588]] earth. [[G1093]]

### 9
[After] [[G2532]] He had said [[G2036]] this, [[G3778]] they [[G846]] watched as [[G991]] He was taken up, [[G1869]] and [[G2532]] a cloud [[G3507]] hid [[G5274]] Him [[G846]] from [[G575]] their [[G846]] sight. [[G3788]]

### 10
They were [[G1510]] looking intently [[G816]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] sky [[G3772]] as He [[G846]] was going, [[G4198]] [when] [[G2532]] suddenly [[G2400]] two [[G1417]] men [[G435]] dressed [[G2066]] in [[G1722]] white [[G3022]] stood beside [[G3936]] them. [[G846]]

### 11
“Men [[G435]] of Galilee,” [[G1057]] they said, [[G2036]] “why [[G5101]] do you stand [here] [[G2476]] looking [[G991]] into [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] sky? [[G3772]] This [[G3778]] [same] [[G3588]] Jesus, [[G2424]] who [[G3588]] has been taken [[G353]] from [[G575]] you [[G4771]] into [[G1519]] heaven, [[G3772]] will come back [[G2064]] in the same way [[G3739]] you have seen [[G2300]] Him [[G846]] go [[G4198]] into [[G1519]] heaven.” [[G3772]]

### 12
Then [[G5119]] they returned [[G5290]] to [[G1519]] Jerusalem [[G2419]] from [[G575]] [the] Mount [[G3735]] of [[G2564]] Olives, [[G1638]] which [[G3739]] is [[G1510]] near [[G1451]] [the city], [[G2419]] a Sabbath day’s [[G4521]] journey [[G3598]] away. [[G2192]]

### 13
When [[G3753]] they arrived, [[G1525]] they went [[G305]] to [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] upper room [[G5253]] where [[G3757]] they were [[G1510]] staying: [[G2650]] Peter [[G4074]] and [[G2532]] John, [[G2491]] James [[G2385]] and [[G2532]] Andrew, [[G406]] Philip [[G5376]] and [[G2532]] Thomas, [[G2381]] Bartholomew [[G918]] and [[G2532]] Matthew, [[G3156]] James [son] [[G2385]] of Alphaeus, [[G256]] Simon [[G4613]] the [[G3588]] Zealot, [[G2207]] and [[G2532]] Judas [son] [[G2455]] of James. [[G2385]]

### 14
With one accord [[G3661]] they [[G3778]] all [[G3956]] continued [[G4342]] in prayer, [[G4335]] along with [[G4862]] [the] women [[G1135]] and [[G2532]] Mary [[G3137]] the [[G3588]] mother [[G3384]] of Jesus, [[G2424]] and [[G2532]] with [[G4862]] His [[G846]] brothers. [[G80]]

### 15
In [[G1722]] those [[G3778]] days [[G2250]] Peter [[G4074]] stood up [[G450]] among [[G3319]] the [[G3588]] brothers [[G80]] (a gathering [[G1909]] of [[G3686]] about [[G5616]] a hundred [[G1540]] [and] twenty) [[G1501]] [and] [[G3588]] said, [[G2036]]

### 16
“Brothers, [[G80]] the [[G3588]] Scripture [[G1124]] had to [[G1163]] be fulfilled [[G4137]] which [[G3739]] the [[G3588]] Holy [[G40]] Spirit [[G4151]] foretold [[G4277]] through [[G1223]] [the] mouth [[G4750]] of David [[G1138]] concerning [[G4012]] Judas, [[G2455]] who [[G3588]] became [[G1096]] a guide [[G3595]] for those who [[G3588]] arrested [[G4815]] Jesus. [[G2424]]

### 17
He was [[G1510]] one of [[G1722]] our [[G1473]] number [[G2674]] and [[G2532]] was allotted [[G2975]] a share [[G2819]] in this [[G3778]] ministry.” [[G1248]]

### 18
( [[G3767]] With [[G1537]] [the] reward [[G3408]] of [his] [[G3588]] wickedness [[G93]] [Judas] [[G3778]] bought [[G2932]] a field, [[G5564]] and [[G2532]] falling [[G1096]] headlong, [[G4248]] he burst open [[G2997]] in [the] middle [[G3319]] and [[G2532]] all [[G3956]] his [[G846]] intestines [[G4698]] spilled out. [[G1632]]

### 19
[This] became [[G1096]] known [[G1110]] to everyone [[G3956]] living [[G2730]] in Jerusalem; [[G2419]] so [[G5620]] they called [[G2564]] that [[G1565]] field [[G5564]] in [[G3588]] their [[G846]] own [[G2398]] language [[G1258]] Akeldama, [[G184]] that [[G3778]] is, [[G1510]] Field [[G5564]] of Blood.) [[G129]]

### 20
“For [[G1063]] it is written [[G1125]] in [[G1722]] [the] book [[G976]] of Psalms: [[G5568]] ‘{May} his [[G846]] dwelling [[G1886]] be [[G1096]] deserted; [[G2048]] let there be [[G1510]] no [[G3361]] [one] [[G3588]] to live [[G2730]] in [[G1722]] it,’ [[G846]] and, [[G2532]] ‘{May} another [[G2087]] take [[G2983]] his [[G846]] office.’ [[G1984]]

### 21
Therefore [[G3767]] it is necessary [to select] [[G1163]] one of the [[G3588]] men [[G435]] who have accompanied [[G4905]] us [[G1473]] [the] whole [[G3956]] time [[G5550]] the [[G3588]] Lord [[G2962]] Jesus [[G2424]] went in [[G1525]] and [[G2532]] out [[G1831]] among [[G1909]] us, [[G1473]]

### 22
beginning [[G756]] from [[G575]] John’s [[G2491]] baptism [[G908]] until [[G2193]] the [[G3588]] day [[G2250]] [Jesus] was taken up [[G353]] from [[G575]] us. [[G1473]] [For] one [[G1520]] of these [[G3778]] must become [[G1096]] a witness [[G3144]] with [[G4862]] us [[G1473]] of [[G3588]] His [[G846]] resurrection.” [[G386]]

### 23
[So] [[G2532]] they proposed [[G2476]] two [men]: [[G1417]] Joseph [[G2501]] called [[G2564]] Barsabbas [[G923]] ( [[G3739]] [also] known as [[G1941]] Justus) [[G2459]] and [[G2532]] Matthias. [[G3159]]

### 24
And [[G2532]] they prayed, [[G4336]] “Lord, [[G2962]] You [[G4771]] know everyone’s heart. [[G2589]] Show [us] [[G322]] which [[G3739]] of [[G1537]] these [[G3778]] two [[G1417]] You have chosen [[G1586]]

### 25
to assume [[G2983]] this [[G3778]] ministry [[G1248]] and [[G2532]] apostleship, [[G651]] which [[G3739]] Judas [[G2455]] abandoned [[G3845]] to go [[G4198]] to [[G1519]] his [[G3588]] [rightful] [[G2398]] place.” [[G5117]]

### 26
Then [[G2532]] they cast [[G1325]] lots, [[G2819]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] lot [[G2819]] fell [[G4098]] to [[G1909]] Matthias; [[G3159]] [so] [[G2532]] he was added [[G4785]] to [[G3326]] the [[G3588]] eleven [[G1733]] apostles. [[G652]]
