### 1
Then [[G2532]] some men [[G5100]] came down [[G2718]] from [[G575]] Judea [[G2449]] [and] were teaching [[G1321]] the [[G3588]] brothers, [[G80]] “Unless [[G1437]] you are circumcised [[G4059]] according to the [[G3588]] custom [[G1485]] of Moses, [[G3475]] you cannot [[G1410]] be saved.” [[G4982]]

### 2
So [[G1096]] Paul [[G3972]] and [[G2532]] Barnabas [[G921]] engaged [[G4714]] [these men] [[G846]] in sharp [[G3641]] debate. [[G2214]] [The two of them] [[G3972]] were appointed, [[G5021]] along with [[G2532]] some [[G5100]] other [[G243]] [ believers ], [[G1537]] to go up [[G305]] to [[G1519]] Jerusalem [[G2419]] to [see] [[G4314]] the [[G3588]] apostles [[G652]] and [[G2532]] elders [[G4245]] about [[G4012]] this [[G3778]] question. [[G2213]]

### 3
Sent on their way [[G4311]] by [[G5259]] the [[G3588]] church, [[G1577]] they [[G3588]] passed through [[G1330]] Phoenicia [[G5403]] and [[G2532]] Samaria, [[G4540]] recounting [[G1555]] the [[G3588]] conversion [[G1995]] of the [[G3588]] Gentiles [[G1484]] and [[G2532]] bringing [[G4160]] great [[G3173]] joy [[G5479]] to all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] brothers. [[G80]]

### 4
[On] [[G1161]] their arrival [[G3854]] in [[G1519]] Jerusalem, [[G2414]] they were welcomed [[G3858]] by [[G575]] the [[G3588]] church [[G1577]] and [[G2532]] apostles [[G652]] and [[G2532]] elders, [[G4245]] [to whom] [[G5037]] they reported [[G312]] all that [[G3745]] God [[G2316]] had done [[G4160]] through [[G3326]] them. [[G846]]

### 5
But [[G1161]] some [[G5100]] believers [[G4100]] from [[G575]] the [[G3588]] party [[G139]] of the [[G3588]] Pharisees [[G5330]] stood up [[G1817]] [and] declared, [[G3004]] “[The Gentiles] [[G846]] must [[G1163]] be circumcised [[G4059]] and [[G5037]] required [[G3853]] to obey [[G5083]] the [[G3588]] Law [[G3551]] of Moses.” [[G3475]]

### 6
[So] [[G5037]] the [[G3588]] apostles [[G652]] and [[G2532]] elders [[G4245]] met [[G4863]] to look into [[G3708]] this [[G3778]] matter. [[G3056]]

### 7
After [[G1096]] much [[G4183]] discussion, [[G2214]] Peter [[G4074]] got up [[G450]] [and] said [[G2036]] to [[G4314]] them, [[G846]] “Brothers, [[G80]] you [[G4771]] know [[G1987]] that [[G3754]] in [[G575]] [the] early [[G744]] days, [[G2250]] God [[G2316]] made a choice [[G1586]] among [[G1722]] you [[G4771]] [that] the [[G3588]] Gentiles [[G1484]] would hear [[G191]] from [[G1223]] my [[G1473]] lips [[G4750]] the [[G3588]] message [[G3056]] of the [[G3588]] gospel [[G2098]] and [[G2532]] believe. [[G4100]]

### 8
And [[G2532]] God, [[G2316]] who [[G3588]] knows the heart, [[G2589]] showed His approval [[G3140]] by giving [[G1325]] the [[G3588]] Holy [[G40]] Spirit [[G4151]] to them, [[G846]] just [[G2532]] as [[G2531]] [He did] to us. [[G1473]]

### 9
He made no distinction [[G1252]] between [[G3342]] us [[G1473]] and [[G2532]] them, [[G846]] [for] He cleansed [[G2511]] their [[G846]] hearts [[G2588]] by [[G3588]] faith. [[G4102]]

### 10
Now [[G3568]] then, [[G3767]] why [[G5101]] do you test [[G3985]] God [[G2316]] by placing [[G2007]] on [[G1909]] the [[G3588]] necks [[G5137]] of the [[G3588]] disciples [[G3101]] a yoke [[G2218]] that [[G3739]] neither [[G3777]] we [[G1473]] nor [[G3777]] our [[G1473]] fathers [[G3962]] have been able [[G2480]] to bear? [[G941]]

### 11
On the contrary, [[G235]] we believe [[G4100]] [it is] through [[G1223]] the [[G3588]] grace [[G5485]] of [[G3588]] [the] Lord [[G2962]] Jesus [[G2424]] [that] we are saved, [[G4982]] just as [[G5158]] they [are].” [[G2548]]

### 12
The [[G3588]] whole [[G3956]] assembly [[G4128]] fell silent [[G4601]] [as they] [[G2532]] listened to [[G191]] Barnabas [[G921]] and [[G2532]] Paul [[G3972]] describing [[G1834]] [the] [[G3745]] signs [[G4592]] and [[G2532]] wonders [[G5059]] God [[G2316]] had done [[G4160]] among [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] Gentiles [[G1484]] through [[G1223]] them. [[G846]]

### 13
When [[G3326]] they [[G846]] had finished speaking, [[G4601]] James [[G2385]] declared, [[G611]] “Brothers, [[G80]] listen to [[G191]] me! [[G1473]]

### 14
Simon [[G4826]] has told us [[G1834]] how [[G2531]] God [[G2316]] first [[G4412]] visited [the Gentiles] [[G1980]] to take [[G2983]] from [[G1537]] [them] [[G1484]] a people [[G2992]] [to be] [[G3588]] His [[G846]] [own]. [[G3686]]

### 15
The [[G3588]] words [[G3056]] of the [[G3588]] prophets [[G4396]] agree [[G4856]] with this, [[G3778]] as [[G2531]] it is written: [[G1125]]

### 16
‘After [[G3326]] [this] [[G3778]] I will return [[G390]] and [[G2532]] rebuild [[G456]] David’s [[G1138]] fallen [[G4098]] tent. [[G4633]] Its [[G846]] ruins [[G2679]] I will rebuild, [[G456]] and [[G2532]] I will restore it, [[G461]]

### 17
so that [[G3704]] the [[G3588]] remnant [[G2645]] of men [[G444]] may seek [[G1567]] the [[G3588]] Lord, [[G2962]] and [[G2532]] all [[G3956]] the [[G3588]] Gentiles [[G1484]] who [[G3739]] bear [[G1941]] My [[G1473]] name, [[G3686]] says [[G3004]] [the] Lord [[G2962]] who does [[G4160]] these things [[G3778]]

### 18
[that] have been known [[G1110]] for [[G575]] ages.’ [[G165]]

### 19
[It is] my [[G1473]] judgment, [[G2919]] therefore, [[G1352]] that we should not cause trouble for [[G3926]] the [[G3588]] Gentiles [[G1484]] [who] are turning [[G1994]] to [[G1909]] God. [[G2316]]

### 20
Instead, [[G235]] we should write [[G1989]] [ and tell] them [[G846]] to abstain from [[G568]] [ food ] [[G3588]] polluted [[G234]] by idols, [[G1497]] [from] [[G2532]] sexual immorality, [[G4202]] [from] [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] meat of strangled animals, [[G4156]] and [[G2532]] from [[G3588]] blood. [[G129]]

### 21
For [[G1063]] Moses [[G3475]] has [[G2192]] been proclaimed [[G2784]] in every [[G2596]] city [[G4172]] from [[G1537]] ancient [[G744]] times [[G1074]] [and] is read [[G314]] in [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] synagogues [[G4864]] on [[G2596]] every [[G3956]] Sabbath.” [[G4521]]

### 22
Then [[G5119]] the [[G3588]] apostles [[G652]] and [[G2532]] elders, [[G4245]] with [[G4862]] the [[G3588]] whole [[G3650]] church, [[G1577]] decided [[G1380]] to select [[G1586]] men [[G435]] from among [[G1537]] them [[G846]] to send [[G3992]] to [[G1519]] Antioch [[G490]] with [[G4862]] Paul [[G3972]] and [[G2532]] Barnabas. [[G921]] [They chose] Judas [[G2455]] called [[G2564]] Barsabbas [[G923]] and [[G2532]] Silas, [[G4609]] [two] leaders [[G2233]] among [[G1722]] the [[G3588]] brothers, [[G80]]

### 23
[and sent them with] [[G1125]] this letter: [[G5495]] “The [[G3588]] apostles [[G652]] and [[G2532]] the [[G3588]] elders, [[G4245]] [your] brothers, [[G80]] To the [[G3588]] brothers [[G80]] among [[G1537]] [the] Gentiles [[G1484]] in [[G2596]] Antioch, [[G490]] Syria, [[G4947]] and [[G2532]] Cilicia: [[G2791]] Greetings. [[G5463]]

### 24
It has come to our attention [[G1894]] that [[G3754]] some [[G5100]] went out [[G1831]] from [[G1537]] us [[G1473]] without our authorization [[G1291]] [and] unsettled [[G384]] your [[G4771]] minds [[G5590]] by what [they] said. [[G3056]]

### 25
[So] we all agreed [[G1380]] to choose [[G1586]] men [[G435]] to send [[G3992]] you [[G4771]] along with [[G4862]] our [[G1473]] beloved [[G27]] Barnabas [[G921]] and [[G2532]] Paul, [[G3972]]

### 26
men [[G444]] who have risked [[G3860]] their [[G846]] lives [[G5590]] for [[G5228]] the [[G3588]] name [[G3686]] of our [[G1473]] Lord [[G2962]] Jesus [[G2424]] Christ. [[G5547]]

### 27
Therefore [[G3767]] we are sending [[G649]] Judas [[G2455]] and [[G2532]] Silas [[G4609]] to tell you [[G518]] [in person] [[G3056]] the [[G3588]] same things [we are writing you]. [[G846]]

### 28
It seemed good [[G1380]] to the [[G3588]] Holy [[G40]] Spirit [[G4151]] and [[G2532]] to us [[G1473]] not [[G3367]] to burden [[G922]] you [[G4771]] [with anything] beyond [[G4119]] these [[G3778]] essential requirements: [[G1876]]

### 29
[You must] abstain [[G568]] from food sacrificed to idols, [[G1494]] from blood, [[G129]] from the meat of strangled animals, [[G4156]] and [[G2532]] from sexual immorality. [[G4202]] You will do [[G4238]] well [[G2095]] to avoid [[G1301]] these things. [[G3739]] Farewell.” [[G4517]]

### 30
So [[G3767]] [the men] [[G3588]] were sent off [[G630]] [and] went down [[G2718]] to [[G1519]] Antioch, [[G490]] [where] [[G2532]] they assembled [[G4863]] the [[G3588]] congregation [[G4128]] [and] delivered [[G1929]] the [[G3588]] letter. [[G1992]]

### 31
[When] [[G1161]] [the people] read [it], [[G314]] they rejoiced [[G5463]] at [[G1909]] [its] [[G3588]] encouraging message. [[G3874]]

### 32
Judas [[G2455]] and [[G2532]] Silas, [[G4609]] [who] [[G2532]] themselves [[G846]] were [[G1510]] prophets, [[G4396]] said much [[G1223]] to encourage [[G3870]] and [[G2532]] strengthen [[G1991]] the [[G3588]] brothers. [[G80]]

### 33
After spending [[G4160]] some time [there], [[G5550]] they were sent off [[G630]] by [[G575]] the [[G3588]] brothers [[G80]] in [[G3326]] peace [[G1515]] to [return to] [[G4314]] those who [[G3588]] had sent [[G649]] them. [[G846]]

### 34
It seemed good [[G1380]] however [[G1161]] to Silas [[G4609]] to remain [[G1961]] there. [[G847]]

### 35
But [[G1161]] Paul [[G3972]] and [[G2532]] Barnabas [[G921]] remained [[G1304]] at [[G1722]] Antioch, [[G490]] along with [[G3326]] many [[G4183]] others, [[G2087]] teaching [[G1321]] and [[G2532]] preaching [[G2097]] the [[G3588]] word [[G3056]] of the [[G3588]] Lord. [[G2962]]

### 36
Some [[G5100]] time [[G2250]] later [[G3326]] Paul [[G3972]] said [[G2036]] to [[G4314]] Barnabas, [[G921]] “Let us go back [[G1994]] [and] visit [[G1980]] the [[G3588]] brothers [[G80]] in [[G2596]] every [[G3956]] town [[G4172]] where [[G3739]] we proclaimed [[G2605]] the [[G3588]] word [[G3056]] of the [[G3588]] Lord, [[G2962]] [ to see ] how [[G4459]] they are doing. [[G2192]]

### 37
Barnabas [[G921]] wanted [[G1014]] to take [[G4838]] John, [[G2491]] [also] called [[G2564]] Mark. [[G3138]]

### 38
But [[G1161]] Paul [[G3972]] thought it best [[G515]] not [[G3361]] to take [[G4838]] him, [[G3778]] [because] he [[G3588]] had deserted [[G868]] them [[G846]] in [[G575]] Pamphylia [[G3828]] and [[G2532]] had not accompanied [[G4905]] them [[G846]] in [[G1519]] the [[G3588]] work. [[G2041]]

### 39
Their disagreement was so sharp [[G3948]] that [[G5620]] they [[G846]] parted [[G673]] company. [[G240]] Barnabas [[G921]] took [[G3880]] Mark [[G3138]] [and] sailed [[G1602]] for [[G1519]] Cyprus, [[G2954]]

### 40
but [[G1161]] Paul [[G3972]] chose [[G1951]] Silas [[G4609]] [and] left, [[G1831]] commended [[G3860]] by [[G5259]] the [[G3588]] brothers [[G80]] to the [[G3588]] grace [[G5485]] of the [[G3588]] Lord. [[G2962]]

### 41
And [[G1161]] he traveled through [[G1330]] Syria [[G4947]] and [[G2532]] Cilicia, [[G2791]] strengthening [[G1991]] the [[G3588]] churches. [[G1577]]
