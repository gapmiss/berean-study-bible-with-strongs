### 1
“Behold, [[H2005]] I will send [[H7971]] My messenger, [[H4397]] who will prepare [[H6437]] the way [[H1870]] before Me. [[H6440]] Then the Lord [[H113]] whom [[H834]] you [[H859]] seek [[H1245]] will suddenly [[H6597]] come [[H935]] to [[H413]] His temple— [[H1964]] the Messenger [[H4397]] of the covenant, [[H1285]] in whom [[H834]] you delight— [[H2655]] see, [[H2009]] He is coming,” [[H935]] says [[H559]] the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts. [[H6635]]

### 2
But who [[H4310]] can endure [[H3557]] the day [[H3117]] of His coming? [[H935]] And who [[H4310]] can stand [[H5975]] when He appears? [[H7200]] For [[H3588]] He [[H1931]] will be like a refiner’s [[H6884]] fire, [[H784]] [like] a launderer's [[H3526]] soap. [[H1287]]

### 3
And He will sit [[H3427]] as a refiner [[H6884]] and purifier [[H2891]] of silver; [[H3701]] He will purify [[H2891]] the sons [[H1121]] of Levi [[H3878]] and refine [[H2212]] them like gold [[H2091]] and silver. [[H3701]] Then they will present [[H5066]] offerings [[H4503]] to the LORD [[H3068]] in righteousness. [[H6666]]

### 4
Then the offerings [[H4503]] of Judah [[H3063]] and Jerusalem [[H3389]] will please [[H6149]] the LORD, [[H3068]] as in days [[H3117]] of old [[H5769]] and years [[H8141]] gone by. [[H6931]]

### 5
“Then I will draw near [[H7126]] to you [[H413]] for judgment. [[H4941]] And I will be [[H1961]] a swift [[H4116]] witness [[H5707]] against sorcerers [[H3784]] and adulterers [[H5003]] and [[H7650]] perjurers, [[H8267]] against oppressors [[H6231]] of the widowed [[H490]] and fatherless, [[H3490]] and against those who defraud laborers [[H7939]] of their wages [[H7916]] and deny justice [[H5186]] to the foreigner [[H1616]] but do not [[H3808]] fear Me, [[H3372]] says [[H559]] the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts. [[H6635]]

### 6
“Because [[H3588]] I, [[H589]] the LORD, [[H3068]] do not [[H3808]] change, [[H8138]] you [[H859]] descendants [[H1121]] of Jacob [[H3290]] have not [[H3808]] been destroyed. [[H3615]]

### 7
Yet from the days [[H3117]] of your fathers, [[H1]] you have turned away [[H5493]] from My statutes [[H2706]] and have not [[H3808]] kept them. [[H8104]] Return [[H7725]] to Me, [[H413]] and I will return [[H7725]] to you,” [[H413]] says [[H559]] the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts. [[H6635]] But you ask, [[H559]] “How [[H4100]] can we return?” [[H7725]]

### 8
“Will a man [[H120]] rob [[H6906]] God? [[H430]] Yet [[H3588]] you [[H859]] are robbing [[H6906]] Me!” [[H853]] You ask, [[H559]] “How [[H4100]] do we rob You?” [[H6906]] “In tithes [[H4643]] and offerings. [[H8641]]

### 9
You [[H859]] are cursed [[H779]] with a curse, [[H3994]] yet you— [[H859]] the whole [[H3605]] nation— [[H1471]] are still robbing Me. [[H6906]]

### 10
Bring [[H935]] the full [[H3605]] tithe [[H4643]] into [[H413]] the storehouse, [[H1004]] so that there may be [[H1961]] food [[H2964]] in My house. [[H1004]] Test Me [[H974]] in this,” [[H2063]] says [[H559]] the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts. [[H6635]] “See if [[H518]] I will not [[H3808]] open [[H6605]] the floodgates [[H699]] of heaven [[H8064]] and pour out [[H7324]] for you  blessing [[H1293]] without [[H1097]] measure. [[H1767]]

### 11
I will rebuke [[H1605]] the devourer [[H398]] for you,  so that it will not [[H3808]] destroy [[H7843]] the fruits [[H6529]] of your land, [[H127]] and the vine [[H1612]] in your field [[H7704]] will not [[H3808]] fail to produce fruit,” [[H7921]] says [[H559]] the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts. [[H6635]]

### 12
“Then all [[H3605]] the nations [[H1471]] will call you blessed, [[H833]] for [[H3588]] you [[H859]] will be [[H1961]] a land [[H776]] of delight,” [[H2656]] says [[H559]] the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts. [[H6635]]

### 13
“Your words [[H1697]] against Me [[H5921]] have been harsh,” [[H2388]] says [[H559]] the LORD. [[H3068]] “Yet you ask, [[H559]] ‘What [[H4100]] have we spoken [[H1696]] against You?’ [[H5921]]

### 14
You have said, [[H559]] ‘It is futile [[H7723]] to serve [[H5647]] God. [[H430]] What [[H4100]] have we gained [[H1215]] by keeping [[H8104]] His requirements [[H4931]] and walking [[H1980]] mournfully [[H6941]] before [[H6440]] the LORD [[H3069]] of Hosts? [[H6635]]

### 15
So now [[H6258]] we [[H587]] call the arrogant [[H2086]] blessed. [[H833]] Not only [[H1571]] do evildoers [[H6213]] prosper, [[H1129]] they even [[H1571]] test [[H974]] God [[H430]] and escape.’” [[H4422]]

### 16
At that time, [[H227]] those who feared [[H3372]] the LORD [[H3068]] spoke [[H1696]] to one [[H376]] another, [[H7453]] and the LORD [[H3068]] listened [[H7181]] and heard [them]. [[H8085]] So a scroll [[H5612]] of remembrance [[H2146]] was written [[H3789]] before Him [[H6440]] regarding those who feared [[H3372]] the LORD [[H3068]] and honored [[H2803]] His name. [[H8034]]

### 17
“They will be Mine,” [[H1961]] says [[H559]] the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts, [[H6635]] “on the day [[H3117]] when [[H834]] I [[H589]] prepare [[H6213]] My treasured possession. [[H5459]] And I will spare [[H2550]] them [[H5921]] as [[H834]] a man [[H376]] spares [[H2550]] his own son [[H1121]] who serves [[H5647]] him. [[H853]]

### 18
So you will again [[H7725]] distinguish [[H7200]] between [[H996]] the righteous [[H6662]] and the wicked, [[H7563]] between [[H996]] those who serve [[H5647]] God [[H430]] and those who [[H834]] do not.” [[H3808]]
