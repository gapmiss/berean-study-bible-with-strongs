### 1
And now [[H6258]] this [[H2063]] decree [[H4687]] is for you, [[H413]] O priests: [[H3548]]

### 2
“If [[H518]] you do not [[H3808]] listen, [[H8085]] and if [[H518]] you do not [[H3808]] take [it] [[H7760]] to [[H5921]] heart [[H3820]] to honor [[H5414]] My name,” [[H8034]] says [[H559]] the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts, [[H6635]] “I will send [[H7971]] a curse among you, [[H3994]] and I will curse [[H779]] your blessings. [[H1293]] Yes, [[H1571]] I have already begun to curse them, [[H779]] because [[H3588]] you are not [[H369]] taking [[H7760]] it to [[H5921]] heart. [[H3820]]

### 3
Behold, [[H2005]] I will rebuke [[H1605]] your  descendants, [[H2233]] and I will spread [[H2219]] dung [[H6569]] on [[H5921]] your faces, [[H6440]] the waste [[H6569]] from your feasts, [[H2282]] and you will be carried off [[H5375]] with it.” [[H413]]

### 4
Then you will know [[H3045]] that [[H3588]] I have sent [[H7971]] you [[H413]] this [[H2063]] commandment, [[H4687]] that My covenant [[H1285]] with [[H854]] Levi [[H3878]] may continue,” [[H1961]] says [[H559]] the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts. [[H6635]]

### 5
“My covenant [[H1285]] with him [[H854]] was [[H1961]] [one] of life [[H2416]] and peace, [[H7965]] and I gave them [[H5414]] to him;  it called for reverence, [[H4172]] and he revered Me [[H3372]] and stood in awe [[H2865]] of My name. [[H8034]]

### 6
TRUE [[H571]] instruction [[H8451]] was [[H1961]] in his mouth, [[H6310]] and nothing [[H3808]] FALSE [[H5766]] was found [[H4672]] on his lips. [[H8193]] He walked [[H1980]] with Me [[H854]] in peace [[H7965]] and uprightness, [[H4334]] and he turned [[H7725]] many [[H7227]] from iniquity. [[H5771]]

### 7
For [[H3588]] the lips [[H8193]] of a priest [[H3548]] should preserve [[H8104]] knowledge, [[H1847]] and people should seek [[H1245]] instruction [[H8451]] from his mouth, [[H6310]] because [[H3588]] he [[H1931]] is the messenger [[H4397]] of the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts.” [[H6635]]

### 8
“But you [[H859]] have departed [[H5493]] from [[H4480]] the way, [[H1870]] and your instruction [[H8451]] has caused many [[H7227]] to stumble. [[H3782]] You have violated [[H7843]] the covenant [[H1285]] of Levi,” [[H3878]] says [[H559]] the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts. [[H6635]]

### 9
“So I [[H589]] in turn [[H1571]] have made [[H5414]] you despised [[H959]] and humiliated [[H8217]] before all [[H3605]] the people, [[H5971]] because [[H6310]] you have not [[H369]] kept [[H8104]] My ways, [[H1870]] but have shown partiality [[H5375]] in matters of the law.” [[H8451]]

### 10
Do we not [[H3808]] all [[H3605]] have one [[H259]] Father? [[H1]] Did not [[H3808]] one [[H259]] God [[H410]] create us? [[H1254]] Why then [[H4069]] do we break faith [[H898]] with one [[H376]] another [[H251]] so as to profane [[H2490]] the covenant [[H1285]] of our fathers? [[H1]]

### 11
Judah [[H3063]] has broken faith; [[H898]] an abomination [[H8441]] has been committed [[H6213]] in Israel [[H3478]] and in Jerusalem. [[H3389]] For [[H3588]] Judah [[H3063]] has profaned [[H2490]] the LORD's [[H3068]] beloved [[H157]] sanctuary [[H6944]] by marrying [[H1166]] the daughter [[H1323]] of a foreign [[H5236]] god. [[H410]]

### 12
[As] for the man [[H376]] who [[H834]] does this, [[H6213]] may the LORD [[H3068]] cut off [[H3772]] from the tents [[H168]] of Jacob [[H3290]] [everyone who is] awake [[H5782]] and aware— [[H6030]] even if he brings [[H5066]] an offering [[H4503]] to the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts. [[H6635]]

### 13
And this [[H2063]] is another [[H8145]] thing you do: [[H6213]] You cover [[H3680]] the altar [[H4196]] of the LORD [[H3068]] with tears, [[H1832]] with weeping [[H1065]] and groaning, [[H603]] because He no [[H369]] longer [[H5750]] regards [[H6437]] your offerings [[H4503]] or receives them [[H3947]] gladly [[H7522]] from your hands. [[H3027]]

### 14
Yet you ask, [[H559]] “Why?” [[H5921]] It is because [[H5921]] the LORD [[H3068]] has been a witness [[H5749]] between you [[H996]] and [[H996]] the wife [[H802]] of your youth, [[H5271]] against whom [[H834]] you [[H859]] have broken faith, [[H898]] though she is [[H1931]] your companion [[H2278]] and your wife [[H802]] by covenant. [[H1285]]

### 15
Has not [the LORD] [[H3808]] made them [[H6213]] one, [[H259]] having a portion [[H7605]] of the Spirit? [[H7307]] And why [[H4100]] one? [[H259]] Because He seeks [[H1245]] godly [[H430]] offspring. [[H2233]] Therefore guard yourselves [[H8104]] in your spirit [[H7307]] and do not [[H408]] break faith [[H898]] with the wife [[H802]] of your youth. [[H5271]]

### 16
“For [[H3588]] I hate [[H8130]] divorce,” [[H7971]] says [[H559]] the LORD, [[H3068]] the God [[H430]] of Israel, [[H3478]] “and [I hate when a man] covers himself [[H3680]] and his garment [[H3830]] with [[H5921]] violence,” [[H2555]] says [[H559]] the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts. [[H6635]] Therefore guard yourselves [[H8104]] in your spirit [[H7307]] and do not [[H3808]] break faith. [[H898]]

### 17
You have wearied [[H3021]] the LORD [[H3068]] with your words; [[H1697]] yet you ask, [[H559]] “How [[H4100]] have we wearied Him?” [[H3021]] By saying, [[H559]] “All [[H3605]] who do [[H6213]] evil [[H7451]] [are] good [[H2896]] in the sight [[H5869]] of the LORD, [[H3068]] and in them  He [[H1931]] delights,” [[H2654]] or, [[H176]] “Where [[H346]] is the God [[H430]] of justice?” [[H4941]]
