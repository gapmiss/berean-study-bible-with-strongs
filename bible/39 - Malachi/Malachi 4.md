“For [[H3588]] behold, [[H2009]] the day [[H3117]] is coming, [[H935]] burning [[H1197]] like a furnace, [[H8574]] when all [[H3605]] the arrogant [[H2086]] and every [[H3605]] evildoer [[H6213]] will be [[H1961]] stubble; [[H7179]] the day [[H3117]] is coming [[H935]] when I will set them ablaze,” [[H3857]] says [[H559]] the LORD [[H3069]] of Hosts. [[H6635]] “Not [[H3808]] a root [[H8328]] or branch [[H6057]] will be left [[H5800]] to them.” [[H1992]]

###### 2
“But for you who fear [[H3373]] My name, [[H8034]] the sun [[H8121]] of righteousness [[H6666]] will rise [[H2224]] with healing [[H4832]] in its wings, [[H3671]] and you will go out [[H3318]] and leap [[H6335]] like calves [[H5695]] from the stall. [[H4770]]

###### 3
Then you will trample [[H6072]] the wicked, [[H7563]] for [[H3588]] they will be [[H1961]] ashes [[H665]] under [[H8478]] the soles [[H3709]] of your feet [[H7272]] on the day [[H3117]] I [[H589]] am preparing,” [[H6213]] says [[H559]] the LORD [[H3068]] of Hosts. [[H6635]]

###### 4
“Remember [[H2142]] the Law [[H8451]] of Moses [[H4872]] My servant, [[H5650]] the statutes [[H2706]] and ordinances [[H4941]] I commanded [[H6680]] him [[H853]] for [[H5921]] all [[H3605]] Israel [[H3478]] at Horeb. [[H2722]]

###### 5
Behold, [[H2009]] I [[H595]] will send [[H7971]] you  Elijah [[H452]] the prophet [[H5030]] before [[H6440]] the coming [[H935]] of the great [[H1419]] and dreadful [[H3372]] Day [[H3117]] of the LORD. [[H3068]]

###### 6
And he will turn [[H7725]] the hearts [[H3820]] of the fathers [[H1]] to [[H5921]] their children, [[H1121]] and the hearts [[H3820]] of the children [[H1121]] to [[H5921]] their fathers. [[H1]] Otherwise, [[H6435]] I will come [[H935]] and strike [[H5221]] the land [[H776]] with a curse.” [[H2764]]
